0.0	0.435802582555	It just needs a corporate executive type at the top that's done it before.
0.0	0.583703417637	And I believe I can, because I have a proven record, a record of accomplishment, a record of cutting taxes, of shrinking the government, of reforming education, of challenging the status quo, eliminating career civil service protections, shrinking the government workforce by 11 percent, but leading the nation in job growth.
0.0	0.424429287708	And that's why I've offered a specific program to the people of America tonight to address the fundamental problem of getting our country growing again, getting our economy growing, wages up, opportunities for people.
0.0	0.478032608866	When it comes to the audit the Fed bill, as Rand knows well, I was an original sponsor of the bill, I'm strongly supportive of it.
0.0	0.206382628675	Just want to get that out there, just saying.
0.0	0.419465597727	And when countries violate trade agreements or dump product in this country, we need -- we need to stand up against those countries that do that without making them into an enemy.
0.0	0.348030317519	So it wasn't just me who opposed it.
0.0	0.264277752541	But if you want someone to drive you home, I will get the job done and I will get you home.
0.0	0.292756810282	This isn't -- this isn't, you know, a different kind of job.
0.0	0.49200796577	Under each of those three parts of my plan, I have very specific recommendations about what to do.
0.0	0.26592218785	I think they're more interested in what we have to say about all the big issues facing us.
0.0	0.347009542036	I think we become unmoored and I think without the religious foundation that guides us all, I think we have a great risk of going horribly in the wrong direction.
0.0	0.488871545553	It's the strongest pro-worker immigration plan.
0.0	0.43326336873	Look, every time the Federal Government gets engaged in something it gets worse.
0.0	0.314553662876	You can't grow your way out of demographics.
0.0	0.400402990796	But I -- the struggle of single moms is extraordinary.
0.0	0.47840865746	I have yet to see a proposal that you're describing that the -- raising the cap would apply to passive income.
0.0	0.357078822119	don't listen to the Trumps of the world and allowing them to divide us.
0.0	0.391694267615	And, sometimes we're held up in contempt by people who write columns, but, I guarantee you to every person on this stage there's something deep inside of us that would cause us to give up our livelihoods and step out on this stage and fight for the people of America.
0.0	0.361425031534	And if we want to try to rebuild the coalition, as Governor Kasich was saying before, then what we better do is to get to the Arab countries that believe that ISIS is a threat, not only to them, but to us and to world peace, and bring them together.
0.0	0.493801333332	I want this bill to be voted down.
0.0	0.335835932326	I said, "What's your problem?"
0.0	0.43196913946	Because I don't think we should be imposing new big programs that are going to raise middle class families' taxes.
0.0	0.492241932026	Well, it's not a matter of what the first executive order would be, Bill.
0.0	0.432204848418	I made it when I ran in 2008.
0.0	0.389397876587	I looked at the evidence.
0.0	0.513183535279	Now, who are the people who are hurt by that?
0.0	0.495097123489	Those hedge funds.
0.0	0.49827326978	As you know, he came to Vermont to campaign for me when he was a senator.
0.0	0.247808836177	That is not right.
0.0	0.263314929827	I'm all about making sure we actually get results for whatever we do.
0.0	0.510621943576	There is no money in the Social Security account.
0.0	0.404966951605	Look these are the things that we did in own state through the recession.
0.0	0.286266640704	Really big league.
0.0	0.409854821345	I own a big chunk of the Bank of America Building at 1290 Avenue of the Americas, that I got from China in a war.

0.0	0.324006719687	I want a government so small that the individual has a chance to thrive and prosper.
0.0	0.375906576874	Because if your faith causes you to care for the less fortunate, it is something you want to see in your public figures.
0.0	0.243495278101	Can I -- can I -- I just...
0.0	0.463234325914	...in the world for people...
0.0	0.306006745859	I've seen plenty of other people follow up?
0.0	0.288317032961	He's wrong.
0.0	0.428342196467	So we have a good group of people.
0.0	0.307263017158	Because most of the time, they're absolutely correct.
0.0	0.437744225974	I have no clue whether the federal government is the proper place, my instinct is to say, hell no, just about everything about the federal government.
0.0	0.358723256678	I want to ask you: Are you fed up with how Washington taxes you?
0.0	0.358893588831	We're not -- the American people -- forget about anything else, they've already been lied to and stolen from.
0.0	0.312239220218	I am proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend.
0.0	0.18027265618	It's not going to happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.317846261232	I believe that we have got to move toward a path toward citizenship.
0.0	0.397008076605	And I will be laying out in detail, what I think we need to do with our friends and allies in Europe and elsewhere to do a better job of coordinating efforts against the scourge of terrorism.
0.0	0.484288140151	Doesn't hurt rich people if their bar of soap goes up ten cents, but it hurts the poor and the middle class.

0.0	0.256403678587	No, they don't like he beats the rest of the field, because they want me.
0.0	0.262858771072	We serve you.

0.0	0.312419856173	You want to see a war on women?
0.0	0.460474867559	We even had warnings about the Boston Marathon bombers, and yet the dots weren't connected.
0.0	0.300654988609	They know it's not a good thing, and they may even be upset by it.
0.0	0.407249884748	And that's why this study, which shows that if you can believe it today, for white working class people between 45 and 54, life expectancy is actually going down.

0.0	0.486745676722	We're a country of laws, Bill.
0.0	0.353347309132	We need a nominee who is going to throw every punch, not pull punches, and someone who cannot stumble before he even gets into the ring.
0.0	0.378042187607	That's the right of people.
0.0	0.289419586322	They do it to us, we don't it.
0.0	0.220496297876	I mean, you know...
0.0	0.449429180482	When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York.
0.0	0.470530958546	What we should do is to be investing in all types of energy, John, all types of energy.
0.0	0.31419753873	And I also know that -- and I'm glad to see this -- Senator Sanders has really moved in face of the facts about what we're confronting in our country.
0.0	0.325982707407	We think we're going to do very well in Iowa with the liberty vote.
0.0	0.304287266988	If I was president, I'd say, "Congratulations.
0.0	0.357895944835	And so -- and I've always made that clear about that cover story.
0.0	0.24294838546	I don't need the rhetoric.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.463514859411	Our economy -- people are working harder and being left behind.
0.0	0.319116195646	And let's not let the secular progressives drive that out of us.
0.0	0.43450995147	We now have much more information about what must be done to fix our criminal justice system.
0.0	0.518372041033	It's their money.
0.0	0.553726949022	Is there an area for a safety net?
0.0	0.480757094464	And yes, I was fired over a disagreement in the boardroom.
0.0	0.246148605098	They don't want them made here.
1.0	0.813454994205	And again, paid for.
0.0	0.44860180961	And we have to support Sunni-Arab and Kurdish forces against ISIS, because I believe it would be not only a strategic mistake for the United States to put ground combat troops in, as opposed to special operators, as opposed to trainers, because that is exactly what ISIS wants.
0.0	0.5	That's not true.
0.0	0.254989550353	When did we beat Japan at anything?
0.0	0.467046498896	We now have a gun on every table.
0.0	0.0	We know...
0.0	0.0	OK?
0.0	0.421763162508	It's virtually useless.
0.0	0.276430643094	If we do that again, we will lose again, we will deserve to lose again.
0.0	0.24350307561	I think more of it is coming and it's going to grow.
0.0	0.354858281124	I will tell you this, I will beat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.0	Yes.
0.0	0.456847698748	It's real estate.
0.0	0.46481508607	Because part of this is the startup challenges that this system is facing.
0.0	0.276840350671	That's why we need to work with them, not demonize them, as the Republicans have been doing.
0.0	0.419640970338	I ask for your support on the caucuses come Monday night and I will make you proud as our party's nominee.
0.0	0.281693396302	You've got to keep asking because this is a hugely important issue.
0.0	0.28169339487	They didn't know the room was too big, because they didn't have anybody there.
0.0	0.518880839809	But they will not be paying, Martha, any private insurance.
0.0	0.527244447996	Number one...
1.0	0.535707211676	It says that after 35 million people have come here over the last 20 years, almost all of whom are unskilled workers, flattening wages, creating horrible opportunity -- a lack of opportunities for unskilled workers, we're going to do something about reducing the level of immigration by 25 percent.
0.0	0.0	That is...
0.0	0.325937778575	As far as the wall is concerned, we're going to build a wall.
0.0	0.515719304565	In fact, after it happened, the president called my husband -- he called all the former presidents and he said to Bill, "Well I assume Hillary has told you about this."
0.0	0.20514345089	Hey, I'm not saying they're stupid.
0.0	0.456441972527	So I think we need radical changes in the funding of higher education.
0.0	0.323342203743	But then they're going to get a call from the donors or probably from the lobbyist for Ford and say, "You can't do that to Ford, because Ford takes care of me and I take care of you, and you can't do that to Ford."
0.0	0.505332462701	And what is that proposal?
0.0	0.46163151397	In terms of Wall Street, I respectfully disagree with you, madam secretary, in the sense that the issue here is when you have such incredible power and such incredible wealth.
0.0	0.422210882183	They're a feeding frenzy for sick people.
0.0	0.499177328483	The B-52 is still operational as the long range bomber; it was inaugurated in the age of Harry Truman.
0.0	0.347214436386	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.564473683111	Reforming entitlements, cutting taxes.
0.0	0.446707351022	I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created.
0.0	0.253572125581	Now, it's very interesting.
0.0	0.374380529914	... that stage, and that is exactly what I am ready to do.
0.0	0.190461155242	We have to do something.
0.0	0.502783817949	It would bring the money back into the United States to help build jobs by American companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about.
0.0	0.437239333887	Iran is sponsoring terrorism in many parts of the world, destabilizing areas.
0.0	0.268497803347	And, they're always going to say, "Well, we're going to fix this one day."
0.0	0.394893820427	All I'm saying is our next president has to be someone that undoes the damage Barack Obama has done to this country.
0.0	0.351494553278	And, you know, I do think it's important to do exactly what Senator Sanders said, and that is to start talking about the issues that the American people really care about, and that they talk to each of us about.
0.0	0.434559012873	So guns have to be looked at as its own problem, but we also have to figure out how we're going to deal with the radicalization here in the United States.
0.0	0.328497070817	But here's the best solution of all.
0.0	0.459195604653	What I am very happy in this campaign that we have had rallies with tens of thousands of people, mostly young people.
0.0	0.349017569104	So if we're going to be talking like this, we can -- and maybe we can score some political points -- but the fact is: Every one of us stands for the kind of economy that will work better for every American.
0.0	0.375998413898	Kevin, if I could just jump in.
0.0	0.337833656388	But I like to be unpredictable so that people don't know exactly... (LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.451873491019	And of course, it has to be de-conflicted with the Russians, who are also flying in that space.
0.0	0.3980233156	What this campaign is about is creating a process for a political revolution in which millions of Americans, working people who have given up on the political process, they don't think anybody hears their pains or their concerns.
0.0	0.442640362629	We have to rebuild our infrastructure.
0.0	0.305387600566	So it is difficult.
0.0	0.348950791272	How are they going to beat ISIS?
0.0	0.379138706144	Now I am the only candidate up here that doesn't have a super PAC.
0.0	0.307383925285	We can't.
0.0	0.551739962692	...is the lowest personal rate any candidate up here has, and what it would also enable us to do is for every citizen to fill out their taxes on a postcard so we can eliminate the IRS.
0.0	0.418354114685	Obviously, we were distressed when we learned of it, because we have worked very hard -- I said in the beginning of this campaign, we want to reach as many voters as possible, and we have tens of thousands of volunteers doing that, and entering data all the time to keep up with what people are telling us.
0.0	0.433025472428	I happen to believe that Putin is doing what he is doing because his economy is increasingly in shambles and he's trying to rally his people in support of him.
0.0	0.250475233415	I hope those are the issues we'll discuss.
0.0	0.380796249233	I'm looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.441138114526	We have to support the fighters on the ground, principally the Arabs and the Kurds who are willing to stand up and take territory back from Raqqa to Ramadi.
0.0	0.429954456599	So you know, I had to report results every 90 days in excruciating detail.
0.0	0.558708768975	It was an investment bank, Lehman Brothers, that contributed to our collapse.
0.0	0.448799502568	I will immediately terminate President Obama's illegal executive order on immigration, immediately.
0.0	0.364974153582	They don't want to raise the minimum wage, they don't want to do anything to increase incomes.
0.0	0.191631921087	That can be done.
0.0	0.400554402101	And that's a tragedy because now...
0.0	0.252550149647	But if we don't know right and wrong, I think we have lost our way.
0.0	0.252464892993	You should stick with it and that's exactly what happened.
0.0	0.183406784882	And guess what?
0.0	0.335104297086	I want to make sure the wealthy pay their fair share, which they have not been doing.
0.0	0.320416368813	But it's a lot safer.
0.0	0.516003356038	He's been a negative force.
0.0	0.412510180841	We had an audit-the-Fed vote, which was the biggest thing my dad had been advocating for, for 30 years, Ted didn't have time to show up.
0.0	0.661913119985	He's lost $4,000 in the last seven years in his income because of this administration.
0.0	0.310734570118	Do we have answer for that?
0.0	0.350315534319	And when we -- and when we do that, we don't do what the Republicans want, which is to cut Social Security.
0.0	0.410258160154	But I'll tell you what would have happened, if we had not joined with our European partners and our Arab partners to assist the people in Libya, you would be looking at Syria.
0.0	0.342775788587	We just can't do it any longer.
0.0	0.562613151393	So it's not just the government -- the private sector companies, it's also our own government that needs to raise the level of our game.
0.0	0.160361868401	Think about it.
0.0	0.390753819722	The economy was really booming.
0.0	0.309345532819	So David, the conclusion of all of those things is this; they weren't hopes, they weren't dreams, they weren't amorphous goals out there.
0.0	0.399289546092	The big banks--
0.0	0.454886715955	John, there is not a serious economist who would disagree that the six big banks of Wall Street have taken on so much power and that all of us are still on the hook to bail them out on their bad bets.
0.0	0.400994669081	We elected someone as president who wants to change America, who wants to make it more like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.512402810503	That's my bill.
0.0	0.434639221358	And I do believe, and I would disagree somewhat with one of my colleagues, this is a genocidal threat.
0.0	0.219101647079	But this is what I do believe.
0.0	0.187483927998	And I'm glad I did it.
0.0	0.233140643383	You want to know why things don't get done in Washington?
0.0	0.271745486139	I just don't believe that this country's days are going to be deeply -- you know, going down.
0.0	0.227821672134	You've got a bit of experience, I would imagine.
0.0	0.377318809845	This will end.
0.0	0.510002955984	But I'd sign a second one, as I did in New York, as well, having a hard hiring freeze on adding new employees except for the military or defense-related positions.
0.0	0.541612794689	What Reagan did is he began with tax reform and regulatory reform, unleashing the engine of the American free enterprise system.
0.0	0.248487827429	Well, I've got news for you, we can.
0.0	0.42440374815	How can we beat an enemy if our commander-in-chief doesn't have the moral honesty and clarity to say that Islam has a problem, and that problem is radical Islam, to say they've got to condemn not generic acts of violence, but the individual murderers who are committing these acts of violence.
0.0	0.247597679897	When I'm president, we're going to have a president that acts like it.
0.0	0.416920075442	We need a ground force in Iraq and Syria, and America has to be part of that ground force.
0.0	0.186540632487	I think so, right.
0.0	0.487133166155	When extraordinarily wealthy people make very large contributions to Super PACs, and in many cases in this campaign, Super PACs have raised more money than individual candidates have, OK?
0.0	0.420114665055	Obamacare, we're going to repeal it and replace it.
0.0	0.495903781167	Otherwise, law enforcement is blind -- blind before, blind during, and, unfortunately, in many instances, blind after.
0.0	0.440105856035	And I'll tell you what Hillary Clinton has said: Hillary Clinton says she agrees with the dissenters -- the Supreme Court dissenters in the Heller case.
0.0	0.371340208362	There's never going do be perfect bill.
0.0	0.414566316473	But, here is a pledge I've made throughout this campaign, and it's really not a very radical pledge.
0.0	0.43626959455	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.401175544868	Well, I don't agree with that, because we will not get the support on the ground in Syria to dislodge ISIS if the fighters there who are not associated with ISIS, but whose principal goal is getting rid of Assad, don't believe there is a political, diplomatic channel that is ongoing.
0.0	0.268191152552	I am telling the truth.
0.0	0.463412925072	So this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement.
0.0	0.436567542238	In Louisiana, instead we're helping people getting better paying jobs so they can provide for their own health care.
0.0	0.400260669639	Yeah, I would go, first of all, one step further in this description of Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.501251340765	There were four dissenters, and they said that they believe the Second Amendment protects no individual right to keep and bear arms whatsoever, which means, if their view prevailed and the next president's going to get one, two, three, maybe four Supreme Court justices, the court will rule that not a single person in this room has any right under the Second Amendment and the government could confiscate your guns.

1.0	0.886414308713	And, it says blanket amnesty, I do not support blanket amnesty...
0.0	0.331297682165	By the way, unlike our country where we're totally predictable and the enemy, whether it's ISIS or anybody else, they know exactly what we're doing because we have the wrong leadership.
1.0	0.74628104507	Very few children.
0.0	0.51685475211	And Senator Sanders's plan really rests on making sure that governors like Scott Walker contribute $23 billion on the first day to make college free.

0.0	0.500974894115	And what I think all of us are saying is, our monetary policy, our tax policy, regulatory policy needs to be radically changed so we can create high sustained growth for income to rise.
0.0	0.316003347495	You can't have a question.
0.0	0.547629964385	I think it's only fair to put on the record, Senator Sanders voted in the Senate for a resolution calling for ending the Gadhafi regime and asking that the U.N. be brought in, either a congressional vote or a U.N. Security Council vote.

0.0	0.342404777947	Give people a chance.
0.0	0.383361620564	So, you know, again, the difference between us and the Republicans is night and day.
0.0	0.511654880438	Last quarter, it was just announced our gross domestic product -- a sign of strength, right?
0.0	0.375369599634	And especially what these programs are asking us to pass that will do nothing to help the environment, but will be devastating for our economy.
0.0	0.372769155166	Your prosecute criminals.
0.0	0.593152706348	And I ended a federal entitlement.
0.0	0.18696380666	But here's what's going to happen:
0.0	0.382053053713	Ben Carson, can you do math?
0.0	0.428913215421	Who do you know will kill the terrorists, defend the constitution and repeal Obamacare?
0.0	0.428764200356	As Americans, we have shown ourselves to have the greatest military on the face of the planet, but we are not so very good at anticipating threats and appreciating just how difficult it is to build up stable democracies, to make the investments and sustainable development that we must as a nation if we are to attack the root causes of these sorts of instability.
0.0	0.441365504495	I could only get two Republican votes on that.
0.0	0.344352477532	I know that because I buy the product."
0.0	0.426051609873	We also have to build a coalition at home.
0.0	0.315976426942	... issues they have to respond to.
0.0	0.391551103497	You can trust me to do the following: that when I get on change with Hillary Clinton, we won't be debating about the science, we'll be debating about the solutions.
0.0	0.286294948937	All of us want equal pay for equal work.
0.0	0.468117239851	If I'm elected president, we will not let in refugees from countries controlled by ISIS or Al Qaida.
0.0	0.439962858892	He cut and run.
0.0	0.277328294182	And I think this is an important question.
0.0	0.237384143397	We got it.
0.0	0.350398196791	Find out what I said to Greenspan.
0.0	0.30412340508	That could be the great Trojan Horse.
0.0	0.474318580124	We have gutted our ability to detect the next attack.
0.0	0.233021074581	They're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.484653589242	The second will be to the supreme leader of Iran.
0.0	0.480870131305	If my memory is correct, I think when we saw children coming from these horrendous, horrendously violent areas of Honduras and neighboring countries, people who are fleeing drug violence and cartel violence, I thought it was a good idea to allow those children to stay in this country.
0.0	0.651520784913	My 750,000 donors have contributed more than a million and a half donations.
0.0	0.433562573419	I will do everything I can to make certain that the United States and our brave men and women in the military do not get bogged down in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.
1.0	0.351044008494	I didn't have an involvement with them.
0.0	0.274788450698	So here's this -- the situation, I think, Maria.
0.0	0.315925179553	I mean, let me be honest with the people who are watching at home.
0.0	0.435080475606	The intelligence was by no means absolute.
0.0	0.41436361186	And that's the reason that I've said under my presidency, we'll create jobs and make American the number one manufacturing country in the world.
0.0	0.366174652487	Because we can't just save the American Dream, we can expand it to reach more people, and change more lives than ever before.
0.0	0.337299155523	That's the negotiator we have.
0.0	0.304041012569	Look at what's happening with the Republicans.
0.0	0.331582541271	There are a lot of things we've got to do in our country, reigning in Wall Street is certainly one of them.
0.0	0.203575874656	We can do that.
0.0	0.453688662335	My state is doing great across the board.
0.0	0.412722679201	The fact that each amendment didn't fix every problem didn't mean that I supported the rest of the bill.
0.0	0.491358484068	Well, first off, let's face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.396019088296	And they consorted with Barack Obama to steal from Social Security.
0.0	0.408327160798	And I've had many situations in the state of Ohio where we've had to move, whether it's storms, whether it was a horrible school shooting.
0.0	0.489687698615	How about Obamacare, a certified job killer?
0.0	0.370190910593	He is a good man.
0.0	0.453191249181	The people that Washington leaves behind.
0.0	0.267449917902	Well, I think it's pretty clear that they know that I will.
0.0	0.42580522953	Examine our records, pray on it and I will be honored if you and your family will come caucus for us on Monday night.
0.0	0.302863143003	I think God has blessed this country with enormous natural resources, and we should pursue all of the above.
0.0	0.386603793828	Americans are tired of hearing this debate -- want to go to, what are you going to do about illegal immigration?
0.0	0.621055241314	We have -- wait a second, we have $19 trillion in debt.
0.0	0.410011324985	But, more importantly, to train a Sunni-led force in Syria to take out ISIS with our support...
0.0	0.346641520752	And I will go back to Washington with my plan.
0.0	0.205405603569	And we're gonna be there very soon.
0.0	0.403546407938	They are anxious about international terrorism and the possibility of another attack on America.
0.0	0.345818984477	Maria, Neil, thank you for a great debate tonight.
0.0	0.484106537239	This nation is the most powerful military in the world.
0.0	0.551288892994	You know, I won two record elections.
0.0	0.28228547962	And it's going to get worse, because remember, Obamacare really kicks in in '16, 2016.
0.0	0.242425291168	He didn't know.
0.0	0.387877574192	He undermines it.
0.0	0.328794826818	They built the great wall of China.
0.0	0.378233269255	We need leadership, someone who has a backbone and sticks with things, rather than just talks about them as though anything matters when you're talking about amendments that don't even actually are part of a bill that ever passed.
0.0	0.3528778404	Everybody on this stage is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.37793829366	We need to deal with ISIS in the caliphate.
0.0	0.535937446877	And what distributes goods better?
0.0	0.315802199755	Bad by those in the Senate who voted for it and if I'm president, we'll make our intelligence community strong, and won't have to keep everybody out, we're just going to keep the bad folk out and make sure they don't harm us.
0.0	0.3922223471	That is what this debate is all about, and I would suggest let's stay focused on those issues -- rather than just attacks directed at each other.
0.0	0.0	OK?
0.0	0.344971769437	I came to Washington, D.C. in 1990.
0.0	0.638367050256	You know, the NASDAQ dropped 80 percent -- 80 percent -- and it took 15 years for the NASDAQ to recover.
0.0	0.492617086965	I have a detailed immigration plan that is on my website, tedcruz.org.
0.0	0.299792829139	I think I'm going to win fair and square (inaudible) to win this way.
0.0	0.279984969651	They will never make America great again.
0.0	0.501975557868	This is about the bigger, broader war against ISIS.
0.0	0.361288040637	That tells you right away where he was headed on all of this.
0.0	0.528259190535	And the last piece is this.
0.0	0.635946197287	We are at 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.326886517116	We actually did it.
1.0	0.729405318575	Everybody voted for it wanting to see Libya move toward democracy, of course we all wanted to do that.
0.0	0.264064537498	We now finally are where we need to be.
0.0	0.555153183688	And I will pay for it by, yes, taxing the wealthy more, closing corporate loopholes, deductions, and other kinds of favorable treatment.
0.0	0.511772514276	I am not a member of the political class.
0.0	0.49194899172	But we're becoming a third word country, because of our infrastructure, our airports, our roads, everything.
0.0	0.446078349973	I would say that I would and I have a permit, which is very unusual in New York -- a permit to carry.
0.0	0.468876809005	I have been a strong ally with him on virtually every issue.
0.0	0.376475448675	It's a -- it's absolutely disgraceful that Secretary Kerry and others said in their response to what's going on in Iran that this was a good thing; it showed how the relationship was getting better.
0.0	0.491569212179	You have to deal with entitlements, you have to be in a position to control discretionary spending.
0.0	0.36042300784	The fact of the matter is we the American people are not each other's enemies, it's those people who are trying to divide us who are the enemies.
0.0	0.424251824017	You see, why are we one of the most generous people in the world -- no, the most generous people in the world?
0.0	0.320573882234	This is the fantasy that I talked about in the beginning.
0.0	0.381079400151	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.325026318135	Now, you'd have to ask yourself, why are they running ads against me?
1.0	0.518105651734	Becky, it is the height of hypocrisy for Mrs. Clinton to talk about being the first woman President, when every single policy she espouses, and every single policy of President Obama has been demonstrably bad for women.
0.0	0.389536943568	This deal in Washington is an example of why Washington's broken.
0.0	0.381958908064	I will not shock anybody to suggest that in politics there is occasionally a little bit of hypocrisy.
0.0	0.438592969861	It's no longer enough just to say the vast majority of Americans want common sense gun safety measures including gun owners.
0.0	0.316775295836	Let me just add to that.
0.0	0.411672740145	It comes from the right, from the left, from people on all sides of the political spectrum.
0.0	0.430692932019	We will finish the 700 miles of fencing and walls our nation needs.
0.0	0.464886448779	Do we still have standards?
0.0	0.595660645949	And so what I have proposed, number one, is a $5,000 tax credit to help people who have very large out-of-pocket costs be able to afford those.
0.0	0.435555459002	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.44926542108	And that's only the beginning of the failures that they have committed, not only in the Middle East, but all over the world, including Russia and China.
0.0	0.309877664991	That's absurd, and I think people who don't want to fix it, really, or unwilling to take the chance to say, "something has to change," are missing the boat here.
0.0	0.481976643115	But what is particularly insulting, though, is that he is the king of saying, "you're for amnesty."
0.0	0.379764987332	I think, you know, Rand and I have some significant issues on policy, but I respect Rand.
0.0	0.439269384742	And I understand in many universities a heck of a lot of vice presidents who earn a big salary.
0.0	0.336177565377	It is going to be amazingly destructive.
0.0	0.339172054732	Here's a fact.
0.0	0.43132831313	And many of the fights that are going on are not ones that the United States has either started or have a role in.
0.0	0.426145635841	He is the party's frontrunner right now, and good for him.
0.0	0.430996709078	And when America does not lead, the world is a dangerous and a tragic place.
0.0	0.272703852569	Look, what we need on this issue is not more polls.
0.0	0.431148534658	... family leave for a very long time...
0.0	0.373301344344	We need to mobilize the entire country to treat our veterans and treat them with much more respect than they get today.
1.0	0.834077310699	When I ran in 1999, David, for mayor of Baltimore, our city by that year had become the most addicted, violent, and abandoned in America.
0.0	0.469938567837	Where were we attacked?
0.0	0.388632758236	I saw Ted Cruz say, "we'll take citizenship off the table, and then the bill will pass, and I'm for the bill."
1.0	0.867797542271	As I understand it, the African-American community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse.
0.0	0.301620364807	But in 2008, we elected a president that didn't want to fix America.
0.0	0.596328705823	The second point, it does not eliminate the corporate tax or the payroll tax.
0.0	0.268163560928	But the real -- but I think we have to get back to what this election has to be about.
0.0	0.571280069934	And you wanted to know the numbers, the Tax Foundation, which has scored every one of our plans, shows that this plan will allow the economy to generate 4.9 million jobs, to raise wages over 12 percent, and to generate 14 percent growth.
0.0	0.444287778068	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.308992079457	But when you're a governor, you have to admit it.
0.0	0.395369802005	But here's something that I believe we have to do as we put together an international coalition, and that is we have to understand that the Muslim nations in the region -- Saudi Arabia, Iran, Turkey, Jordan -- all of these nations, they're going to have to get their hands dirty, their boots on the ground.
0.0	0.33061719525	They can't lead us.
0.0	0.397272123875	They sweated like dogs.
1.0	0.815081434065	I think it's fair to say, Assad has killed, by last count, about 250,000 Syrians.
0.0	0.286170370694	That is absolutely not right.
0.0	0.426290868661	But the president leads in this regard.
0.0	0.410041728086	You know, I became a grandmother 15 months ago, and so I spent a lot of time thinking about my granddaughter's future.
0.0	0.454012232112	Because the more you tax something, the less of it you get.
0.0	0.300626760424	Well, Neil, I'm glad we're focusing on the important topics of the evening.
0.0	0.417937000554	But the good news is the next commander-in-chief is standing on this stage.
0.0	0.210256585175	And they're all over the place.
0.0	0.295701882886	And they're wonderful people.
0.0	0.434205611413	And to expand on Mr. Carson's -- or Dr. Carson's question, let's face it, we have laws already.
0.0	0.267178087646	Let me start -- I want to get to the substance of the question on jobs, but I want to start with something.
0.0	0.463476188371	Number one, the people negotiating don't have a clue.
0.0	0.302007638272	Megyn, that's the problem.
0.0	0.461896738927	And that's why Ronald Reagan said that it was a blindfold.
0.0	0.369177861057	That's how you make peace in the world.
0.0	0.479447805753	We took it away from the NSA, it was a bad decision by the president.
0.0	0.521653272714	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.220814292041	He sure did.
0.0	0.447508178297	I don't know if people understand, but I spent a lifetime with my colleagues getting us to a federal balanced budget.
0.0	0.0	...
0.0	0.290621761591	What we need to do is destroy their ability to attack us here over there, and then get out.
0.0	0.430410340592	We want to destroy ISIS, it has to be in the air and on the ground.
0.0	0.200176776372	I think it's -- yeah, I think it's a one-two punch.
0.0	0.358374531348	Part of the reason why it hasn't risen because sometimes we're not giving people the skills they need.
0.0	0.272410106283	That's essentially what we have now, and we don't need that.
0.0	0.225889127789	But, let me tell you who not to blame.
0.0	0.0	I was not at all.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.357082681258	This is a terribly complicated issue.
0.0	0.39052101434	Medicare for all, single-payer system is the way we should go.
0.0	0.32888768636	They will not bring us -- believe me -- to the promised land.
0.0	0.456288809355	...eliminates the business...
0.0	0.43332546171	I am on the committee that helped write the Affordable Care Act.
0.0	0.355508519455	Larry Kudlow is an example, who I have a lot of respect for, who loves my tax plan.
0.0	0.49801852219	And she and I looked at the same evidence coming from the Bush administration regarding Iraq.
0.0	0.321401024262	Check it out.
1.0	0.826470586428	He put a 25 million dollar check up from his own pocket to fund that campaign and my wife Heidi and I, we ended up investing everything we owned.
0.0	0.490408937704	Kathie, that is the kind of economy I believe, put money in the hands of working people, raise the minimum wage to 15 buck an hour.
0.0	0.427320121201	Yes, we could get rid of Saddam Hussein, but that destabilized the entire region.
0.0	0.426799809337	In my family, my dad fled oppression in Cuba to come to America.
0.0	0.20227333294	I'll give you a fact.
0.0	0.612529350026	There have been more than 4,000 changes to the tax plan since 2001 alone.
0.0	0.244191702842	I would prioritize them.
0.0	0.342019423087	That sounds like people are afraid the president's going to take their guns away.
0.0	0.32808494695	And so, when we look at these complex problems, I wish it could be either/or.
0.0	0.463372250258	We are mixing apples and oranges.
0.0	0.249665814086	Let em also tell you...
0.0	0.366825217433	The threat is Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.529979574524	I am a 2nd amendment person.
0.0	0.37444065829	This is one of the great tragedies in our country today.
0.0	0.348173095086	He was young.
0.0	0.426711549772	But, by the way, when it comes to a woman having to make a very personal choice, ah, in that case, my Republican colleagues love the government and want the government to make that choice for every woman in America.
0.0	0.44145433454	The time has come to stop ignoring the mentally ill in this country and begin to treat them and get them on their feet, along with, of course, with treating the drug-addicted.
0.0	0.230324113824	And, I'm going to tell you exactly how we're going to deal with it when I am president.
0.0	0.319035708168	And I want to make this our government.
0.0	0.388611010955	We're going dark when it comes to detecting the next attack.
0.0	0.41160312432	They go back and forth between Syria and this region.
0.0	0.564071684573	But look, there's one big entitlement we can no longer afford as a country, and that is the entitlement that the super wealthy among us, those earning more than a million dollars, feel that they're entitled to pay lower income tax rates and a far lower preferred income tax rate when it comes to capital gains.
0.0	0.290622530261	Here's the way you need to deal with it.
0.0	0.310290629547	They do not want us to exercise religious liberty.
0.0	0.326429681701	And somebody like a Trump comes along and says, "I know the answers.
0.0	0.516936167148	As you've indicated, what is happening in Syria, the number of people, the hundreds of thousands of people who have been killed -- men, women, 20,000 children, the people who are forced to flee their own country -- their own country -- it is unspeakable.
0.0	0.458324287753	You have small businesses in America that are struggling.
0.0	0.413129322718	We have losers.
0.0	0.22422533347	You know, this is not easy work.
0.0	0.380054922691	That's what we need to to, and I laid that out prior to the crisis with the advice of a lot of people, including 12 Medal of Honor recipients that I'm proud that they're supporting my campaign.
0.0	0.376171310386	But now as I travel the country, people say what I feel.
0.0	0.359833704953	Secondly, we've got to go after everything from North Africa to South Asia and beyond.
0.0	0.175939806666	Yeah.
1.0	0.579985811247	In fact, wages adjusted for inflation haven't risen since the turn of the last century, after my husband's administration.
0.0	0.373591047581	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.291242122076	He said, "I can't get it into China.
0.0	0.406176764255	Now, the fact is, what this president has done is invited Russia to play an even bigger role, bring in Vladimir Putin to negotiate getting those chemical weapons back from Assad, yet what do we have today?
0.0	0.233394286131	But let me go back to something that's very important.
0.0	0.219824679133	And just thirdly, he was so nice.
0.0	0.338550185338	Our greatest days lie ahead if we are willing to do what it takes now.
0.0	0.272015878843	That is important.
0.0	0.601241449282	You have no disposable income when you are make 10, 12 bucks an hour.
0.0	0.439411781098	John, I don't think that there is a crisis at the state or local level that really you can point to and say, therefore, I am prepared for the sort of crises that any man or woman who is commander in chief of our country has to deal with.
1.0	0.50820921905	We have the highest rate of childhood poverty, and we're the only country in the world -- virtually the only country that doesn't guarantee paid family and medical leave.
0.0	0.459718539641	..."diabetes, heart disease, cancer and Alzheimer's?"
0.0	0.480844742989	I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would.
0.0	0.295313196346	Our rights come from God.
0.0	0.26800652479	It could be people that are going to do great, great destruction.
0.0	0.334053567864	I think the only argument is are we a sovereign country, are we not allowed to choose who comes in, when they come in and how they come in?
0.0	0.329177997096	And Abdullah said something recently, very important.
0.0	0.3977690631	Yeah, but the rule includes equal -- got it.
0.0	0.432526677811	And in fact, in Obama administration, we did not meet with anybody without conditions.
0.0	0.393978140221	It is why we have to simplify.
0.0	0.379908349493	It's very important we focus on the threats we face today, and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in.
0.0	0.349181899598	You can't do that without the cooperation of the Muslim world because they're as threatened as we are.
0.0	0.430198783789	They shouldn't automatically assume that because you believe that marriage is between one man and one woman that you are a homophobe.
0.0	0.388075021567	You know, I listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas.
0.0	0.310484900269	So I'm confident if I win this nomination, I will aggressively go against her and beat her.
0.0	0.502701034021	For example, talking about polls, a poll recently came out, overwhelming majority of the American people say we should strengthen the instant background check.
0.0	0.428358492771	There's too much -- it's like -- it's like take the New England Patriots and Tom Brady and have them play your high school football team.
0.0	0.351145684209	And yes, I am angry.
0.0	0.459541699499	Right now, you don't have the -- you have taxes that are too high.
0.0	0.531990111865	I was flattered that Secretary Clinton two months later borrowed so many of my proposals to incorporate into hers.
1.0	0.9096788307	We have the highest rate of childhood poverty among almost any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.531768668416	However, we saved 80,000 jobs and we went on to grow to 160,000 jobs, and scores of technology companies literally went out of business -- like Gateway -- taking all their jobs with them.
0.0	0.217806822378	Listen, I want to just comment.
0.0	0.429504968215	Maria -- Maria, what you were talking about just now is called corporate inversion.
0.0	0.253500297715	And, you know, China comes over and they dump all their stuff, and I buy it.
0.0	0.465959234357	The endorsements that I'm proud of are conservative leaders like Dr. James Dobson, and over 700,000 contributions nationwide, people going to our Web site, tedcruz.org.
0.0	0.457770565983	So, let's not in anyway imply here that either President Obama or myself, would in anyway not take on any vested interested, whether it's Wall Street, or drug companies, or insurance companies, or frankly, the gun lobby to stand up to do what's best for the American people.
0.0	0.371790962858	And in 19 -- and I will tell you this, and I said it very strongly, years ago, I said -- and I love the military, and I want to have the strongest military that we've ever had, and we need it more now than ever.
0.0	0.447523086128	Caucus for me on Monday night because if I am your nominee, I will unite this party and I will defeat Hillary Clinton and when I'm president, America's light will shine again and the 21 century will be a new American century.
0.0	0.409942206952	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.418512503723	But if we elect the right person -- if you elect me -- we will turn this country around, we will reclaim the American dream and this nation will be stronger and greater than it has ever been.
0.0	0.33368477823	Young people for whom getting involved in politics is as, you know, it's like going to the moon.
0.0	0.36015806679	The matter is what orders exist now that shouldn't exist?
0.0	0.335596114226	And we also need a cheerleader.
0.0	0.418172253782	Now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world.
0.0	0.387307218601	If you take donations from Wall Street, you can't be independent.
1.0	0.771698170509	Someone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander in chief and someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi can never be president of the United States.
1.0	0.823346627878	Barack Obama actually had the poison pill to stop it then.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.304517375716	Chris, please attack Ted.
1.0	0.405165475207	It's never below zero.
0.0	0.461524264543	What I said was I don't believe that I would be president of the United States and have the same dysfunction that exists in Washington, D.C. now.
0.0	0.333309371323	We're going to fight it as hard as we can, and we're going to fight whoever the Republicans nominate who will depend on the Koch Brothers, and others.
0.0	0.160361868401	Think about it.
0.0	0.259203574949	But I'm not deciding that anybody's got to make these decisions the way that I do, on the basis of what I do.
0.0	0.508452658373	They are anxious on a number of levels.
0.0	0.354374388905	Well, I will gladly confess that I'm the only one on this stage with no political title.
0.0	0.309710377637	Our friends no longer think we have their back and our enemies no longer fear us, and we're in a much difficult -- we're in a much different position than we should be.
0.0	0.376426367898	So when Nikki said that, I wasn't offended.
1.0	0.889766069826	They see more people in jail in the United States of America than any other country on earth, 2.2 million.
0.0	0.609561568864	So the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced: a simple flat tax, 10 percent for individuals, and a 16 percent business flat tax, you abolish the IRS...
0.0	0.362782059275	Well, let us level with the American people.
1.0	0.90947409222	So states over a period of decades have put their money elsewhere; into prisons, into highways, into things other than higher education.
0.0	0.421415451729	We've got to eliminate the gun show loophole.
0.0	0.514200741663	Well, I was a conservative governor of Virginia, I governed that way, and that's my track record.
0.0	0.360343115033	SuperPacs are a disaster.
0.0	0.360505803753	We're up 400,000 jobs.
0.0	0.305516464438	I'll tell you what else people are concerned about.
0.0	0.406708647731	And let me just say a word about coalition-building, because I've heard Senator Sanders say this.
0.0	0.347214436386	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
1.0	0.605839051612	We borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.296704092886	We're going to be actually out there trying to create a better life for hard-working Americans.
0.0	0.331653292678	But I think if we're ever going to really tackle the problems posed by jihadi extreme terrorism, we need to understand it and realize that it has antecedents to what happened in Iraq and we have to continue to be vigilant about it.
0.0	0.242889488151	You've got to keep asking.
0.0	0.0	But Megyn...
0.0	0.350601675779	And there is no reason that you can't be perfectly fair to the gay community.
0.0	0.486717955858	But there is a better way forward than either of those offered by my two opponents here on this stage.
0.0	0.281923446689	And let me say this also.
0.0	0.391053270733	What you have now is a very dangerous moment in American history.
0.0	0.317978006263	We had Hezbollah.
0.0	0.334594862343	I'm running for president, because as I go around this nation, I talk to a lot of people.
0.0	0.512236842506	And I applaud his record in Maryland.
0.0	0.0	That is what we have to do.
0.0	0.535162529375	They all have jobs.
0.0	0.410939218969	We have been talking about it for decades.
0.0	0.27995274344	Well, I just want to quickly add...
0.0	0.427311212384	We cannot allow safe havens, and as a leader of moral nations around this Earth, we need to come up with new alliances and new ways to prepare for these new sorts of threats, because Martha, this will not be the last region where nation-states fail.
0.0	0.573461345824	Why does the fossil fuel industry pay -- spend huge amounts of money on campaign contributions?
0.0	0.279726165452	And -- and -- you know, it goes back to the whole concept of regulations, which are in everything.
0.0	0.328392942659	Because we have no protection and we have no competence, we don't know what's happening.
0.0	0.390649642864	Now the Libyans are turning their attention to try to dislodge ISIS from its foothold and begin to try to move together to have a unified nation.
0.0	0.486360028062	I will spend every ounce of energy to stop it.
0.0	0.44700618326	That's a drag on the economy.
1.0	0.781384450484	You know, the amendment you're talking about is one sentence -- it's 38 words.
0.0	0.165884407561	They're not good.
0.0	0.303685766276	See, in Ohio, we've had some controversial decisions.
0.0	0.576638034483	It will lower the cost of health care for a middle-class family by thousands of dollars a year.
1.0	0.688979126039	Secondly, I never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.387903121912	...Rand is exactly right.
0.0	0.200618928572	Do you remember that, everybody?
0.0	0.425378443421	And they've come pretty close to that without federal government assistance.
0.0	0.4490888233	Please do not tell me that in this country, if -- and here's the if -- we have the courage to take on the drug companies, and have the courage to take on the insurance companies, and the medical equipment suppliers, if we do that, yes, we can guarantee health care to all people in a much more cost effective way.
0.0	0.447500187366	But Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term, and you should be showing up to work.
0.0	0.0	I have.
0.0	0.560546222811	Where basically, businesses now will have to pay a tax, both on the money they make, but they also have to pay taxes on the money that they pay their employees.
0.0	0.393488851512	More importantly, I want kids in Burlington, Vermont, or Baltimore, Maryland, who are in the sixth grade or the eighth grade, who don't have a lot of money, whose parents -- like my parents -- may never have gone to college.
0.0	0.629130442106	His plan is a good plan, and I will note that my 10% plan also eliminates the payroll tax, eliminates the death tax,
0.0	0.234876744711	Well, I'll tell you who is on my side.
0.0	0.269675177696	And we have nothing.
0.0	0.494083251854	And I would -- first of all, face him down in that whole region, the whole Baltic region.
0.0	0.326886517116	But actually I am.
0.0	0.473118295481	(BELL RINGS) ... and there's a reason, when Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer came after our right to keep and bear arms, that I led the opposition, along with millions of Americans -- we defeated that gun control legislation.
0.0	0.227996579419	I will find the guy that's going to take that military and make it really work.
0.0	0.330465679751	All of you in Iowa, I need you to caucus for me.
0.0	0.372010205904	And I'm going to do everything I can to address distressed communities, whether they are communities of color, whether they are white communities, whether they are in any part of our country.
0.0	0.460628623199	This is a watershed election.
0.0	0.369145195107	It is enormously complicated.
0.0	0.254372998724	But look, we didn't know what was happening next.
0.0	0.397481489433	If they will begin to turn their military attention away from going after the adversaries of Assad toward ISIS and put the Assad future on the political and diplomatic track, where it belongs.
0.0	0.484150446998	See, I was there when Reagan rebuilt the military.
0.0	0.360742702082	The reason I did so well last time is not just because of the vision, it's because I have a track record in Washington, D.C. of getting things done.
0.0	0.601936232675	Our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.521568463423	We should have debt-free college if you go to a public college or university.
0.0	0.0	No.
0.0	0.436983074097	Lehman Brothers was not a big bank.
0.0	0.398297840923	We have got to make sure that local police departments look like the communities they serve in their diversity.
0.0	0.291001686901	And in fact I would go further.
0.0	0.227531990657	This is what's going on.
0.0	0.290822047825	Well, this is what I would say.
0.0	0.344377472309	So I want to explain why this is not in America's interest to react with this kind of fear and respond to this sort of bigotry.
0.0	0.513669522241	The officer who told the victims of the San Bernardino killings that he would take a bullet before them.
0.0	0.484144252675	We're asking the top 1.5 percent, including passive income, to start paying a little bit more so that the elderly and disabled vets in this country can live with security and dignity.
0.0	0.518361485509	Look, the -- the simple fact is that my plan actually gives the middle class the greatest break: $2,000 per family.
0.0	0.399233849721	First, rather than expand benefits for everyone, I do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs.
0.0	0.266128224232	But what he's touching -- talking about, I think has got merit.
0.0	0.254087625489	You know, they feel like if they don't have a lobbyist, if they're not wealthy, that somehow they don't get to play.
0.0	0.294896815273	She's not the threat.
0.0	0.0	Look--
0.0	0.366398653858	I have studied that issue in great detail.
0.0	0.412134675619	There's a big question mark on your head.
0.0	0.444028115242	I mean, what we had was something the government made -- basically a bag of gas -- that cut loose, destroyed everything in its path, left thousands of people powerless, but they couldn't get rid of it because we had too much money invested in it, so we had to keep it.
0.0	0.543153626677	My plan actually goes further than Senator Sanders because a big chunk of the cost is actually room and board and books and fees.
0.0	0.239747695977	So those are some of the areas that I think we've got to move on.
0.0	0.463507801565	And, also, acting according to our principles and constructing a new foreign policy of engagement and collaboration, and doing a much better job of identifying threats before they back up into military corners.

0.0	0.235404968832	I will do that.
0.0	0.571494128555	Because seniors, if they are retired, are no longer earning an income from a job.
0.0	0.400837128284	We had this failed red line with Assad and it discouraged folks that want to help us on the ground.
0.0	0.475896238543	Our enemies are getting stronger and stronger by the way, and we as a country are getting weaker.
0.0	0.244823461553	Nobody can do that like me.
0.0	0.335180224035	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you had better get rid of the super PACs, because they're causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that are being made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.286364269885	We always had such a loving relationship in these debates and in between and the tweets.
0.0	0.367954478117	And that's not what we did in Maryland.
0.0	0.463067710926	Neil, my name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.416570345792	And it is easy to talk the talk about ending Citizens United, but what I think we need to do is show by example that we are prepared to not rely on large corporations and Wall Street for campaign contributions, and that's what I'm doing.

0.0	0.483698058	Look at what happened in '08, AIG, a big insurance company, Lehman Brothers, an investment bank helped to bring our economy down.
0.0	0.487649988067	So, yes, I do believe that when we talk about public education in America, today, in a rapidly changing world, we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities.

0.0	0.347647926107	We have to put more money.
0.0	0.543075681391	So when you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration -- which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother -- clearly, we are looking at institutional racism.
0.0	0.599420401205	... and here's the critical point, Maria -- the business flat tax enables us to abolish the corporate income tax, the death tax, the Obamacare taxes, the payroll taxes, and they're border-adjustable, so every export pays no taxes whatsoever.
0.0	0.471596413601	Some of the bravest people that I had the privilege of working with as secretary of state were our development professionals who went sometimes alone, sometimes with our military, into very dangerous places in Iraq, in Afghanistan, elsewhere.
0.0	0.428229582537	A lot has happened in nine months.
0.0	0.258140935292	But we don't see it happening at all.

0.0	0.502611656214	If we elect Hillary Clinton, the next four years will be worse than the last eight, and our children will be the first Americans ever to inherit a diminished country.
0.0	0.520827652255	What the polls are showing is that we are actually defeating the secretary among younger people.

0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.328288632526	Just tell them that, you put people in there, we're going to bomb them.
0.0	0.563170106454	And I spent my entire lifetime balancing federal budgets, growing jobs, the same in Ohio.
0.0	0.426907437051	At the time, the liberal governor of Florida, who claimed he was a Republican -- his name was Charlie Crist -- he wanted to impose cap-and-trade on Florida.
0.0	0.183803118412	I'll take that, too.

0.0	0.331565344346	Neil, Neil -- can I say one thing about this.
0.0	0.469096429004	Well Maria, thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the New York Times.
0.0	0.236716875831	So they put together this.
0.0	0.471933929205	Bill after coming home from Japan, flying 33 missions.
1.0	0.510136453266	And I know this, because when I ran for governor of New York, one in 11 of every man, woman, and child in the state of New York was on welfare.
0.0	0.343598587702	Secretary Clinton, I don't have a super PAC.
0.0	0.338291285333	And so it was (inaudible) his statement, which is why I'm asking him to consider changing his views.
0.0	0.242773224751	Let's get rid of Assad later.
0.0	0.427904944328	We also need a nominee, a candidate who will endorse our own principles.
1.0	0.418537298365	I've used it three times, maybe four times.
0.0	0.5	That's true.
0.0	0.24529227604	But I know that we offered a lot of help and I know it was difficult for the Libyans to accept help.
0.0	0.387244688951	But Bret, here's the problem.
0.0	0.478149943467	With grandiose language, the president talks about red lines and nothing to follow it up; talks about ISIS being the JV team, they form a caliphate the size of Indiana with 35 (thousand) to 40,000 battle-tested terrorists.
0.0	0.205280940584	I agree with them.
0.0	0.394515681378	And we will be strong again.
0.0	0.626026367207	But then his poll numbers tanked.
0.0	0.326322965948	But the problem with free trade is you need really talented people to negotiate for you.
0.0	0.290041165872	Now, you've got Europe.
0.0	0.224274135086	I like them.
0.0	0.271207475749	And I'll allow putting that tariff or whatever he's saying here...
0.0	0.597806831456	Trillions of dollars have gone from the middle class and working families to the top one-tenth of one percent who have doubled the percentage of wealth they now own.
0.0	0.440484344256	Get the lawyers off the damn backs of the military once and for all.
0.0	0.0	It is.
0.0	0.508015500915	These folks, CNBC, they had it down at three, three and a half hours.
0.0	0.481214032454	We've enacted it in our state.
0.0	0.0	And you know what?
0.0	0.395179372828	And Mr. Trump has a great capacity to use bluster and bigotry to inflame people and to make think there are easy answers to very complex questions.
0.0	0.357028540588	I propose to reverse that and get this economy moving again.
0.0	0.283160305153	As you know, because I know you know a lot about health care.
0.0	0.243537674648	And yet that's the kind of mindset that you need to make this country great again.
0.0	0.409235326306	If a person lives in a seven room house, does the government get to say you don't need seven rooms, we're going to take two of them away?
0.0	0.453649727601	If there's an act of violence in America, his immediate answer before he even knows the facts is gun control.
0.0	0.271070046999	Thank you, Marco.
0.0	0.35383572449	I am certainly, absolutely, willing to look at that bill again and make sure there's a stronger bill.
0.0	0.491456690844	We are at war with people who use their religion for purposes of power and oppression.
0.0	0.393261086356	And ISIS is attacking France and attacking Russian airliners.
0.0	0.400212629968	And as president, I will rebuild the military and keep this country safe.
0.0	0.260015856719	What they do is unbelievable, how bad.
0.0	0.283088125419	So yes, you're going to hear a lot of talk about tax reform --
0.0	0.421805336513	And I had to confront the possibility of being a single parent.
0.0	0.444659005727	Why is it that the United States of America today is the only major country on earth that does not guarantee health care to all people as a right?
0.0	0.549476400048	Just as morale in the military has plummeted in the last seven, so it had then.
0.0	0.453319888228	We have to put the personnel on that border in the right places; you have to put the strategic fencing in place; and you have to have aviation assets that fly all the way from Tijuana to El Paso to Brownsville, Texas -- 1,933 miles looking down 24/7, with the technology to be able to identify what individuals are doing, and ID when they are in obviously illegal activities or suspicious activities, and quick response teams come.
0.0	0.50420687998	And one more point, one more point.
0.0	0.403574274126	Marco made the choice to go the direction of the major donors -- to support amnesty because he thought it was politically advantageous.
0.0	0.279543958949	Let me respond to...
0.0	0.220814292041	Sure.
0.0	0.406097830522	Trying to get Iran and Saudi Arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter.
0.0	0.434295237206	Well, I believe that there are abuses, those companies should be permanently barred from ever using the program again and we should put strict standards in place to ensure that they're not being abused, like the prevailing wage requirement and like the advertising requirement.
0.0	0.447788121384	I will run on my record all day long.
0.0	0.0	No.
0.0	0.448845727862	And we won't be using a man like Secretary Kerry that has absolutely no concept of negotiation, who's making a horrible and laughable deal, who's just being tapped along as they make weapons right now, and then goes into a bicycle race at 72 years old, and falls and breaks his leg.
0.0	0.393852630554	Well, look the Joint Terrorism Task Force needs resources and tools.
0.0	0.318762680624	So I believe that working with Europe -- and, by the way, you know, we've got some very wealthy countries there in that part of the world.
0.0	0.475268596201	I know that we are at greater risk today than at any time since then of another attack.
0.0	0.303610475508	CRUZL But I will say --
0.0	0.522899294083	So I have proposed debt free tuition, which I think is affordable and I would move a lot of the Pell Grant and other aid into the arena where it could be used for living expense.
0.0	0.219385858682	That is why we need to make...
0.0	0.54982007563	We used to have 16 workers for one retiree, now you have three workers for one retiree.
0.0	0.372079406855	Yes, we could get rid of Assad tomorrow, but that would create another political vacuum that would benefit ISIS.
0.0	0.479293615547	Let me concur with the secretary, no question women's rights are under fierce attack all over this country.
0.0	0.316212553535	And we're talking about fantasy football?
0.0	0.346655517234	Hey, I have lobbyists.
0.0	0.425693489781	Kissinger was one of those people during the Vietnam era who talked about the domino theory.
0.0	0.281862949694	I'm doing that to say that that's the kind of thinking our country needs.
0.0	0.315648158862	You didn't see it for a minute.
0.0	0.550351092691	Or we're going to ship 10 million Americans -- or 10 million people out of this country, leaving their children here in this country and dividing families?
0.0	0.578419734739	Every single time that there has been a Defense bill in the Senate, three people team up to vote against it.
0.0	0.581667238761	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.417055946745	So I think secretary Clinton and I have a fundamental disagreement.
0.0	0.3456519909	You know, Chris, here's what happened with Medicaid in my state.
0.0	0.421126617184	But bottom line is: The president is right.
0.0	0.471809188301	And somebody walked in and shot them, killed them.
0.0	0.182017782782	Or that we're just going to be great?
0.0	0.337741684502	And, here's the difference between me and Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.341218362963	And I believe that the best way to do that is to be aggressive, to be principled, but to have the goal of trying to improve relations.
0.0	0.362348828683	Let me hear if there's any difference between the Secretary and myself.
0.0	0.520573186163	When millions of Americans rose up against amnesty, I was proud to lead that fight.
1.0	0.742321104969	And let us be clear that every proposal that I have introduced has been paid for.
0.0	0.0	Yes.
0.0	0.390830174027	And we fell into the same trap with Assad, saying -- as if it's our job to say, Assad must go.
0.0	0.511930390028	Because only if it's about three pages are you leveling the playing field between the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected who can hire the armies of lawyers and accountants and, yes, lobbyists to help them navigate their way through 73,000 pages.
0.0	0.539713732233	Save Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security without cuts.
0.0	0.553265277497	He used chemical weapons, he's killed, now, over a quarter of a million of his own people, and this president has done nothing.
0.0	0.428773234476	And let me be clear: While there are some great corporations creating jobs and trying to do the right thing, in my view -- and I say this very seriously -- the greed of the billionaire class, the greed of Wall Street is destroying this economy and is destroying the lives of millions of Americans.
1.0	0.479549260938	That's exactly what the Republican establishment says too.
0.0	0.505859926775	I have worked with President Obama for the last seven years.
0.0	0.295138520792	And I do carry on occasion, sometimes a lot.
0.0	0.392980392309	We need to have a resolve that will bring the world together to root out the kind of radical jihadist ideology that motivates organizations like ISIS, a barbaric, ruthless, violent jihadist terrorist group.
0.0	0.365969414544	No, what I would say is this is look, I was the first of the three of us to call for America to accept the 65,000 refugees we were asked to accept.
1.0	0.714794074361	We are now doing an independent internal investigation to see who else was involved.
0.0	0.257089065793	And I'm not blaming these folks -- but I guess I could.
0.0	0.356741220719	They don't provide any abortions in Louisiana.
0.0	0.291321081266	It's not working.
0.0	0.519862869874	And that someone in that office has to do their job.
0.0	0.327993236625	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.481841517832	Let's allow companies to immediately expense.
0.0	0.469707797538	Number one, our goal is to crush and destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.24475036484	But they need to be absolutely clear about where they stand.
0.0	0.42221662677	I choose him as my vice presidential candidate, and the Democrats sue because we can't take him along for the ride.
0.0	0.0	No.
0.0	0.383706616056	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.344175305423	I was in Burlington, Iowa.
0.0	0.351620795907	I'm going to tell you a couple of stories about trade, because I'm totally against the trade bill for a number of reasons.
0.0	0.402326022112	Terrorism is on the run, China, Russia is advancing their agenda at warp speed, and we pull back.
0.0	0.414527412662	We overcame all of the crowds that were coming down there.
0.0	0.599097026494	I started as a secretary and became ultimately the chief executive of the largest technology company in the world, almost $90 billion in over 150 countries.
0.0	0.498894753672	It's one of 15 strategic goals I've set out to make our country a better place by cutting these sort of deaths in half in the next five years.
0.0	0.470015099718	I'll tell you this, the number one job of the president of the United States is to protect the safety and security of the American people.
1.0	0.809751824275	Look at the attack they inspired in Philadelphia, that the White House still refuses to link to terror, where a guy basically shot a police officer three times.
0.0	0.178257717474	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.547539266226	That's not why I ran for office.
0.0	0.303917446486	Well, it ain't Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.227772489903	I'm happy to answer the question...
0.0	0.35227410001	It cannot solely be America's fight.
0.0	0.275828552274	Might I respond?
0.0	0.417849498716	I think the last eight years in the private sector have allowed me to see government from the outside, and I think that is a positive thing.
0.0	0.496934110714	To repeal these unconstitutional illegal orders, whether it's amnesty or whether it's this president going around the Congress, whether it's in Obamacare, to restore the rule of law.
0.0	0.282806057365	We need a president who can solve our problems, bring us together.
0.0	0.60592414827	If you are now hit on a 60 percent tax on both your income and on the wages you pay your employees, where are you going to get that money from?
0.0	0.327995573186	The answer is yes.
0.0	0.345368842772	Our country deserves no less, because all of the other issues we want to deal with depend upon us being secure and strong.
0.0	0.286173740275	He's a good guy, a smart guy, and he would be a heck of a lot better president than Hillary Rodham Clinton would ever be.
0.0	0.46600566291	You look at these airports, we are like a third world country.
0.0	0.409271281694	And now they are beating us economically.
0.0	0.367925206422	I'm not running against Governor Bush, I'm not running against anyone on this stage.
0.0	0.321995170481	-- fix America, this is the formula.
0.0	0.489088568249	A few days ago a similar incident happened.
0.0	0.242659087471	... and I'd like to respond.
0.0	0.293652665907	So, it's going to be my responsibility to make sure we move forward to solve these problems that are now out in the open.
1.0	0.881655800051	They would give more tax breaks to the super-wealthy and corporations, not to the middle class.
0.0	0.468794048659	Now that Russia has joined us in the Security Council, has adopted an agreement that we hashed out a long day in Geneva three years ago, now I think we can have those conversations.
0.0	0.481402601441	Drugs have taken far too many of our citizens.
0.0	0.393528131979	So the fact is that we work for the people.
0.0	0.323795408955	I will work my heart out.
0.0	0.313059568199	You know, I think, again, both of us share the goal of trying to make college affordable for all young Americans.
0.0	0.377323226752	You get the Congress, you get the Senate, you get together, you do legislation.
1.0	0.842958244902	The average middle-class family will be saving thousands of dollars a year.
0.0	0.0	It is.
0.0	0.18268760072	they expect to get something.
0.0	0.442866131529	This issue touches on two broad issues.
0.0	0.425628350289	They're taking money from Social Security and they're going to spend it on the military and they're going to spend it on domestic spending.
0.0	0.588217106611	This ties into campaign finance reform.
0.0	0.38649221856	If we means test Social Security, it means that the government decides whether or not I deserve it.
0.0	0.447747168075	And we will not, under this proposal, have a situation that we have right now with the Affordable Care Act where you have states like South Carolina, and many other Republican states, that because of their right wing political ideology, are denying millions of people the expansion of Medicaid that we passed in the Affordable Care Act.
0.0	0.238335230224	...the only reason is -- look...
0.0	0.459314598088	Every war you can imaging, we have people at each other's throat and our strength is actually in our unity.
0.0	0.364853875846	That means we have to work more closely with our great tech companies.
0.0	0.0	(APPLAUSE)
0.0	0.481188922688	Karen and I have seven children.
0.0	0.334168679678	I think he would have said bring back a 21st-century Glass-Steagall legislation.
0.0	0.365551239455	You know, the American president has to both keep our families safe and make the economy grow in a way that helps everyone, not just those at the top.
0.0	0.617867643358	Well, we have treated the drug-addicted in our prisons and we released them in to the community, and our recidivism rate is less than 20 percent.
0.0	0.459445650464	At the same time, we know that in many parts of our country police officers are bridging those divides and they're acting heroically.
0.0	0.205144609227	I am passionate about what I believe.
0.0	0.50289154302	He is becoming ISIS's best recruiter.
0.0	0.280141988024	I've got one more question for you then.
0.0	0.319710955085	He was unable to answer the question, is Iraq a good thing or bad thing?
0.0	0.37386795819	Well, I've been talking to a lot of these families, and this is such an outrage, both because it's bad for our economy, we're a 70 percent consumption economy, people need to feel optimistic and confident, they need to believe their hard work is going to be rewarded, and it's bad for our democracy.
0.0	0.370493679723	And God only knows Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator.
0.0	0.359158691842	Well, that has not been a part of most of the proposals that I've seen.
0.0	0.0	You did.
0.0	0.42417259811	The choice between a weak economy and a strong environment is a false choice, that is not the choice I'll offer America.
0.0	0.400546156921	We now have that.
0.0	0.365313810942	And when our staffers said, "whoa, what's going here?"
0.0	0.513165887095	Not assets."
0.0	0.465917984795	And it is now being put into place everyplace across the state of Ohio.
0.0	0.401999389113	It is a constitutional right of every American to be able to protect themselves and their families.
0.0	0.305994880653	I think he has addressed a lot of these issues that have been quite difficult, but he has gone forward.
0.0	0.483146647636	They send their cars over by the millions, and what do we do?
0.0	0.506413385762	We invested more in our infrastructure and we squared our shoulders to the great business opportunity of this era and that is moving our economy to a 100 percent clean electric energy future.
0.0	0.307726412343	You want to know what carpet bombing is?
0.0	0.402225315292	I think that is the smartest way to be able to move forward because if you go to $12 it would be the highest historical average we've ever had.
0.0	0.475348748396	Last I heard, a United States senator had the right to disagree with the president, including a president who has done such an extraordinary job.
0.0	0.528810224588	He hit oil.
0.0	0.290852267781	But I think it is really unfair to suggest that I have not been supportive of the president.
0.0	0.492009417844	And the same goes for overseas, where we have to put together a coalition of Muslim nations.
0.0	0.0	These...
0.0	0.384671586996	We're gutting our military, and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were.
0.0	0.583284692789	When I left the workforce, New York State had been reduced by over 15 percent.
0.0	0.0	Yes.
0.0	0.513459868063	And it's why I've continued to focus on the fact that we need to declare war on the four big cost drivers because 80 percent of all medical costs in this country are chronic disease.
0.0	0.322544579953	But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work.
0.0	0.355289656834	And I think the focus ought to be on making sure that we leave this nomination process, as wild and woolly as it's going to be -- this is not being bad.
0.0	0.465969246329	And you combine that with reforms of our welfare system.
0.0	0.509316519271	Or how about Boeing right here within a mile?
0.0	0.311493559913	So was Ted, but now he says it wasn't so.
0.0	0.356216165117	And when you do that, you will be amazed at how much progress you can make, and how much healing we can have.
1.0	0.852525838425	I have more donations from students and teachers than I do from people associated with Wall Street.
0.0	0.4346161734	And Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will say it's those evil rich people.
0.0	0.350758885741	And I have the feeling you're going to find a lot of cost overruns there and a lot of waste and duplicative activities.
0.0	0.237769498313	Nothing's gonna get done.
0.0	0.161574728733	That is what I want to do.
0.0	0.560636545274	I have the largest bank in the world as a tenant of mine.
0.0	0.272653094606	-- the issue is who is going to get it done.
0.0	0.433653436428	People can promise you something, I delivered in the blue state of New York.
0.0	0.352400689064	I'm the only person on this stage who's done that and we will get it done as President of the United States.
0.0	0.522212167382	Once again, I am running a campaign differently than any other candidate.
0.0	0.480698944903	We would still have racism holding people back.
0.0	0.267365599592	No, I think they won't.
1.0	0.512493031482	All that's in that trust fund is a pile of IOUs for money they spent on something else a long time ago.
0.0	0.59052576994	But the poll numbers have.
0.0	0.302851132991	And we do have a role in this.
0.0	0.36558578901	It ain't complicated.
0.0	0.493417186053	I introduced a series of amendments, each designed to fix problems in the bill.
0.0	0.455625174253	I've employed -- I've employed tens of thousands of people over my lifetime.
0.0	0.527644343536	That's why I'm running for office because when I become president of the United States, on my first day in office we are going to repeal every single one of his unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.433022435441	There's not going to be consensus on this issue until we enforce our immigration laws.
1.0	0.930501514594	When that war began, we had 8,000 planes.
0.0	0.464364251928	I trust Iowans, Granite staters (ph), people in South Carolina, people in Nevada, to start this process out.
0.0	0.262703958639	What are you going to do for my kids?
0.0	0.413559932911	And that's the only way we'll ever balance our budget.
0.0	0.264296410172	You just don't make promises like this.
0.0	0.411679914573	It's coming from all over South and Latin America, and it's coming probably -- probably -- from the Middle East.
0.0	0.377425885922	All young people who have the ability should be able to get a college education.
0.0	0.403369594239	But we need to leave the Cold War and that sort of antiquated thinking behind.
0.0	0.29528544555	And I hear their speeches.
0.0	0.313436563466	It is an agenda, in my view, that would do great harm to our country.
0.0	0.398967558564	Sure, because there has been three different investigations and proven that I knew nothing.
0.0	0.303740409094	Today, I'm 60, I'm not married, I don't have any kids.
0.0	0.450223470549	When you talk about the long-term consequences of war, let's talk about the men and women who came home from war.
0.0	0.40024358086	We need to pass a Medicare for all single payer system.
0.0	0.322500989492	They get good stories, because the newspapers get buffaloed (ph).
0.0	0.472095336083	It's making people in neighborhoods nervous to go to law enforcement.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.247808836177	Right.
0.0	0.351044643973	We need to have everybody in our country focused on watching what happens and reporting it if it's suspicious, reporting what you hear.
0.0	0.513872714705	I saw you on the Senate floor flip your vote on crop insurance because they told you it would help you in Iowa, and last week, we all saw you flip your vote on ethanol in Iowa for the same reason.
0.0	0.25239390197	I think that is the real key here.
0.0	0.41269342569	We can't just allow it to continue on its current path the way that Hillary Clinton wants to do because there'll be major reductions in benefits in the next decade if we do nothing.
0.0	0.380402239005	We're not going to fix what ails our economy, we're not going to make wages go up for everyone by either trying to replace American capitalism with socialism -- which, by the way, the rest of the world is moving away from -- nor will we fix it by submitting to sort of Wall Street-directed crony capitalism.
0.0	0.506121172972	My patients are beside themselves.
0.0	0.473554072232	But what the DNC did arbitrarily without discussing it with us is shut off our access to our information crippling our campaign.
0.0	0.447332364771	That beautiful young woman who's an entrepreneur who served in the military, first of all, is deserving of our respect for service in the military and the fact that she's an entrepreneur.
1.0	0.785762004786	He wrote a forward for a book that basically argued voters should have buyers' remorse when it comes to President Obama's leadership and legacy.
0.0	0.247808836177	Right?
0.0	0.360505803753	We're up 347,000 jobs.
0.0	0.362948578235	We could do a whole show on that.
0.0	0.344678050206	May I offer a different generation's perspective on this?
0.0	0.249903284413	Yeah, they are unhinged.
0.0	0.41632351095	It is a unique nation in all of human history and on the face of the planet, because here, our founders believed that everyone has a right to fulfill their potential and that that right --they called it life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness -- comes from God and cannot be taken away by government.
0.0	0.299202538224	What we know is we're living longer.
0.0	0.427135780274	He's a major Hillary Clinton supporter.
0.0	0.445168779662	And, yes, we are at war with those people.
0.0	0.426780460525	And the fact is, let law enforcement make those decisions.
0.0	0.404020646795	We need fundamental police reform, clearly, clearly, when we talk about a criminal justice system.
0.0	0.350824462462	... And start taking advice...
0.0	0.373227272911	But I have no argument with anyone making up her mind about who to support.
0.0	0.300492087444	Instead, we're listening to the bickering back and forth.
0.0	0.327359273767	And on this issue of the Medicare in particular, it's important because they're going to demagogue what we're saying here tonight.
0.0	0.52580456932	I have voted not to give gun makers and sellers immunity.
0.0	0.435976179116	First, we should pass the Expatriate Terrorist Act, legislation I've introduced that says if an American goes and joins ISIS and wages jihad against America, that you forfeit your citizenship and you can not come in on a passport.
0.0	0.472189520648	Chris, I would note that that the last four questions have been, "Rand, please attack Ted.
0.0	0.470604861377	Just the other day, Russia allowed a television camera to see the plans for a drone submarine that could carry a tactical nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.362170157145	They're leaving because of taxes, but they are also leaving because they can't get their money back and everybody agrees, Democrats and Republicans, that is should come back in.
0.0	0.482222820092	And so people are still going to get health care, thankfully, in emergency rooms, in hospitals.
0.0	0.316943299801	I learned so much.
0.0	0.0	No.
0.0	0.384651635694	How can you get people to vote for you?"
0.0	0.316874412378	Maria, I'd just like to say...
0.0	0.542245372279	They have affiliates in over a dozen countries now.
0.0	0.402877130838	I used the laws of the country to my benefit, I'm sorry.
0.0	0.523132647573	It came out recently they have equipment that is 30 years old.
0.0	0.373195719914	Run the company kids, have a good time.
0.0	0.422915462272	But we have to also be very clear that we do have some continuing challenges.
0.0	0.332049963836	They are going to have to take on ISIS.
0.0	0.351981081029	That's the way it should be, and I'm going to continue to reach out to thank all my online contributors for everything they are doing for me, to encourage them and help me do more just as Senator Sanders is.
0.0	0.301456591751	What else we can do is that we should believe in science.
0.0	0.435807120737	We should be deporting criminals, not hardworking immigrant families who do the very best they can and often are keeping economies going in many places in our country.
0.0	0.481942967891	First of all, earned path to citizenship is basically code for amnesty.
0.0	0.489375968172	At the end of the day, if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, and the governor makes a good point about trade, anti-trade, anti-monopoly activities.
0.0	0.501225280716	We got nuclear weapons that are obsolete.
0.0	0.46704916261	... on the issue -- on the issue of citizenship, Donald...
0.0	0.411036842409	A debate actually is a policy issue, but I will say this.
1.0	0.906830299806	We had a $1.4 trillion deficit.
0.0	0.325700364544	And I think this has become something that needs to be looked at in terms of regulation.
0.0	0.361367441056	They are much more than that.
0.0	0.183704483543	They're never going to let it happen.
0.0	0.468182080238	And here's what the economic issue is.
0.0	0.365414428606	I find it very, very hard to forgive people that deceived me.
0.0	0.43464792415	The government has tried it their way.
0.0	0.232401096688	I hate to hear it."
0.0	0.338676671996	I think it's a big thing that our party needs to be part of, and I've been a leader in Congress on trying to bring about criminal justice reform.
0.0	0.386266986542	He got endorsed by the Sun-Sentinel because he was the most talented guy in the field.
0.0	0.456521682728	It will lead to even greater war in this world.
0.0	0.495796403019	Ninety-three hours.
0.0	0.338593928234	And I said, "well, if he wanted to play a song, maybe he could play, 'New York, New York'?"
0.0	0.478775873548	Well, first of all, I had a national reporter say, you know, there's three lanes.
1.0	0.822728667543	I have long supported the proposition that we should lift the cap on taxable income coming into the Social Security Trust Fund, starting at $250,000.
0.0	0.242134182269	I'm not going to cut it at all; I'm going to bring money in, and we're going to save it.
0.0	0.333585958368	I didn't find it offensive at all.
0.0	0.473099921986	... that he tried to take credit for four years later.
0.0	0.34892338043	And Teddy Roosevelt is right.
0.0	0.163356683116	How great is that?
0.0	0.21414806445	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.382544173264	We're a country of laws, not of men, not of people who do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.5090005712	Our legal immigration system from now on has to be merit-based.
0.0	0.408992092311	You know, I have two sons.
0.0	0.458529258576	And multiple reputable journals, including The Wall Street Journal, said ours is the best.
0.0	0.395356783584	With respect to the United States, I think our role in NATO, our support for the E.U., as well as our willingness to take refugees so long as they are thoroughly vetted and that we have confidence from intelligence and other sources that they can come to our country, we should be doing our part.
0.0	0.327040160747	Anyone can go online at tedcruz.org and read exactly what it said.
0.0	0.385546444879	I -- I've been for pausing on admitting the Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.498114221527	And it will have effects in the private market.
0.0	0.343067539975	I've had my issues with Donald Trump.
0.0	0.450190836156	And we need to be focused and lift the rules of engagement so we're not sending our fighting men and women into combat with their arms tied behind their backs.
0.0	0.422870579103	Obviously, Mrs. Obama has been a terrific leader when it comes to young people's health, particularly nutrition and exercise.

0.0	0.547609359218	My budget was mentioned.
0.0	0.350608031314	But, I don't believe that Washington should be picking winners and losers.
0.0	0.487453554428	I also said that we should take increased numbers of refugees.
0.0	0.370189986372	This is why, fundamentally, we have to take our government back.
0.0	0.382794919056	And first of all, we've got to recognize that there is problem that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have caused.
0.0	0.154263844991	They expect to have it.
0.0	0.411919214377	Number two, we're going to enforce our immigration laws.

0.0	0.398259903194	Well, for a start, this may seem like a radical idea, but I think we have got to tell the medical profession and doctors who are prescribing opiates and the pharmaceutical industry that they have got to start getting their act together, we cannot have this huge number of opiates out there throughout this country, where young people are taking them, getting hooked, and then going to heroin.
0.0	0.377408129311	Barack Obama was never responsible for those decisions.
0.0	0.392831584816	I have the best courses in the world, so I'd say, you what, if he wants to -- I have one right next to the White House, right on the Potomac.

0.0	0.269813731177	Or somebody else.
0.0	0.387628512553	And ISIS, make no mistake about it, is an evil in this world.
0.0	0.258395066257	But I'm not giving up on Libya and I don't think anybody should.
0.0	0.221999224098	But I can tell you this.
0.0	0.470972458183	When I'm president of the United States, we are defending the Second Amendment, not undermining it the way Barack Obama does.
0.0	0.400041547316	I think Bernie Sanders is good candidate for president of Sweden.
0.0	0.425180677831	You know how many votes John McCain missed when he was carrying out that furious comeback that you're now modeling after?
0.0	0.359985586167	Hillary Clinton cannot be president.
0.0	0.224078609395	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.345886490774	Iran is going to take over the Middle East, Iran and somebody else will get the oil, and it turned out that Iran is now taking over Iraq.
0.0	0.349438497277	Somebody said to me the other day, a reporter, a very nice reporter, "But, Mr. Trump, you're not a nice person."
0.0	0.434977042852	I've had had two town halls, one in Keene, one in Laconia, dedicated exclusively to talking about what we can do.
0.0	0.399462408366	We had all kinds of questions that we discussed and, you know, at the end, I recommended to the president that we take the chance to do what we could to find out whether that was bin Laden and to finally bring him to justice.
0.0	0.384977551455	But at the end of the day, no doubt, the Affordable Care Act is a step forward.
0.0	0.189883080616	See?
0.0	0.376942877706	But he wasn't a cheerleader.
0.0	0.471230098941	Hillary Clinton has never been responsible for those kind of decisions where they were held accountable.
0.0	0.366359642289	And what I believe right now, and I believe this is terribly important, is the United States of America cannot succeed, or be thought of as the policeman of the world, that when there's an international crisis all over the world, in France and in the U.K. Or -- hey, just call up the American military and the American taxpayers, they're going to send the troops.
0.0	0.37925393137	But I think -- and I say this with due respect -- that I worry too much that Secretary Clinton is too much into regime change and a little bit too aggressive without knowing what the unintended consequences might be.
0.0	0.228912209537	This is extraordinary.
0.0	0.411444179923	So what I would say is not only do we need to be thinking in military terms, but we do our military a disservice when we don't greatly dial up the investment that we are making in diplomacy and human intelligence and when we fail to dial up properly, the role of sustainable development in all of this.
0.0	0.388068964263	They;re gone.
0.0	0.474564253306	And it's a tax you find in many companies in Europe.
1.0	0.912378824687	You used to support a 500 percent increase in the number of guest workers, now you say that you're against it.
0.0	0.406620578368	So, we're talking about -- we're talking about reform for people like me and people like Senator Cruz, as he talked about earlier, who are years away from retirement that have a way to plan for these changes, and way that's very reasonable.
0.0	0.42731754716	We will arm and train the Kurds.
0.0	0.34225145805	So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives.
0.0	0.256320339225	You know, the Russians wanted to buy time.
0.0	0.412630245506	So, yes, this has developed.
0.0	0.283312270827	Now, our country needs -- our country needs a truly great leader, and we need a truly great leader now.
0.0	0.381313230401	It has not been in effect during the administration of Barack Obama.
0.0	0.500075797071	I've supported a variety of solutions, both state as well as federal.
0.0	0.41569124351	Well, first of all, like many other very big businessmen, I could name them here, but I'm not going to do that for a lot of obvious reasons, but the biggest, and almost all of them, they've all used the chapter laws, the bankruptcy laws to their own benefit.
0.0	0.46641108362	I was very honored to be asked to do that and very honored to serve with him those first four years.
0.0	0.334275737269	And if I could say just one thing.
0.0	0.467588660679	Sit down with people like Jeff Miller, the Republican chairman of the house, and work on a bill.
0.0	0.476461579917	We can end sanctuary cities by cutting off...
1.0	0.47553703551	Right now, think of this: We owe China $1.3 trillion.
0.0	0.290316423454	They can't even make a deal.
0.0	0.376339682874	But what we're seeing happening in Libya right now is that there has been a fragile agreement to put aside the differences that exist among Libyans themselves to try to dislodge ISIS from Sirte, the home town of Gadhafi, and to begin to try to create a national government.
0.0	0.39350551106	He was putting his 10 and 12-year-old boys to bed the other night.
0.0	0.523451913338	I am the only person in either campaign that's self-funding.
0.0	0.382789336658	And I'm so grateful for the diligence, for the seriousness with which the men and women of Iowa approach this process.
0.0	0.454453906473	ISIS is a group that burns people alive in cages; that sells off little girls as brides.
0.0	0.273817244832	The truth is this, the big problem, we need a leader in Washington who understands how to get something done, not to talk about it, not to propose it, to get it done.
0.0	0.321970797354	The Secretary's obviously right.
0.0	0.485507249072	In this administration, every weapon system has been gutted, in this administration, the force levels are going down to a level where we can't even project force.
0.0	0.405471273734	A lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.462597645465	But I have another one, Ford.
0.0	0.226869287319	I understand.
0.0	0.274393257988	And, you know, we have a whole variety of things that they can do and they can do these things simultaneously.
0.0	0.371287235468	I'm not going to have something that Ted described in his tax plan.
1.0	0.724638459484	This small country has welcomed in many refugees.
0.0	0.386031615408	What that is, is just common sense.
0.0	0.381569227702	So, yes, I did know people.
0.0	0.396839271493	Because -- because Donald's mother was born in Scotland.
0.0	0.455561535787	And as someone who's worn the uniform of the country, that's how we build our military back up.
0.0	0.352005036896	This is absolutely absurd.
0.0	0.266260250952	We have a tremendous problem.
0.0	0.621229607855	But I did pass a more progressive income tax and asked the highest-earning people to pay another 14 percent.
0.0	0.300348087168	That's just media stuff.
0.0	0.302730063145	... but wait a minute...
0.0	0.490123529216	It is ISIS.
0.0	0.461525792874	And, you know, with all due respect, Senator, you voted for regime change with respect to Libya.
0.0	0.30289675343	They had a plan that was good.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.367282745424	I believe that the goal should be debt-free college.
0.0	0.404041001039	It's a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.339145027681	Everybody got out -- and they kept our equipment.
0.0	0.471164797923	You remember Obama a year ago, Yemen was a great victory.
0.0	0.46027449264	Just last week, we see saw two Iraqi refugees vetted using the same process the president says will work, that were arrested for being alleged ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.22744135189	So I'm going to come up with the best way forward.
0.0	0.177800576488	Wait for what?
0.0	0.438162842541	We are looking at an economy in which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.
0.0	0.320286573363	I'm not quite the fan of regime change that I believe she is.
0.0	0.471939712708	And second, the First Amendment Defense Act, which is protecting religious liberty, if it's not passed by then, which I suspect it won't, because the president will veto it, I will institute an executive order to make sure that people of faith are not being -- not being harassed and persecuted by the federal government for standing up for the religious beliefs.
0.0	0.275821840508	Look what we did in Iran with Mosaddegh.
0.0	0.516947372686	Secretary Clinton also said we -- it was not just the invasion of Iraq which Secretary Clinton voted for and has since said was a big mistake -- and, indeed, it was.
0.0	0.435553695099	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.388408210041	It is the future of the world and the future of our children and grandchildren.
0.0	0.220752600684	Not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.186530921385	Let me tell you what I think we have got to do.
0.0	0.428850741995	And we are going to be able to defeat ISIS on the ground there, as well as in this world, because of the Muslim Americans in our country and throughout the world who understand that this brutal and barbaric group is perverting the name of a great world religion.
0.0	0.393075760844	We put in place mandatory work fair (ph).
0.0	0.425050893208	And in our party, unlike the Republican party, we actually believe that the more our people learn, the more they will earn and higher education should be a right for every kid.
0.0	0.314823956938	We need to bring people together in Washington.
0.0	0.212293110482	There's something going on and it's bad.
0.0	0.199857916893	I'm happy to have him tonight...
0.0	0.275075960149	Because it wouldn't work.
0.0	0.479730893789	It was country after country without making the investment in human intelligence to understand who the new leaders were and the new forces were that are coming up.
0.0	0.0	Thank you very much.
0.0	0.373432072956	And that is important, because now we have a U.N. Security Council that will enable us to do that.
0.0	0.0	How?
0.0	0.448979959226	If I am elected president...
0.0	0.498515652773	Well, first of all, when we talk about the Import Export Bank, it's time to clean up corporate welfare.
0.0	0.400587216699	The other Arab countries have a role to play in this.
0.0	0.272380541822	We know about the French.
0.0	0.172363224546	... and I'll tell you why.
0.0	0.347052023985	One principle, for example, we've got to embrace is on immigration.
0.0	0.371345184012	Because Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama.
0.0	0.242471152426	I think it's a good product.
0.0	0.305569575935	We don't need to add new rules, we need to make sure the FBI does its job.
0.0	0.495527870474	In addition to that...
0.0	0.493921968405	The Kurds have been asking us to arm them for three years.
0.0	0.311685006505	Look, I look at our economy as an ecosystem.
0.0	0.273782360819	I do think that it's important to defend it.
0.0	0.518199722851	I visited with a number of our neighbors in Northern Virginia at a mosque last Friday.
0.0	0.526645165281	In fact, I was all for you until you started doing that, because that's a misrepresentation, number one.
0.0	0.334879890884	Whatever it takes, as long as it takes, to defeat them.
0.0	0.335012616114	That is what is going to have to happen, if we want to revitalize and rebuild the crumbling middle class.
0.0	0.362951668407	That's the difference.
0.0	0.352037714978	I recommended that the president go forward.
0.0	0.402216631381	I want to make sure we rein in the excessive use of political power to feather the nest and support the super wealthy.
0.0	0.37176631675	Well, we did have a plan, and I think it's fair to say that of all of the Arab leaders, Gaddafi probably had more blood on his hands of Americans than anybody else.
0.0	0.437448810928	We need to take a new approach of taxing -- reforming how we tax, and reforming the regulations in our -- in our country before it's too late.
0.0	0.313879703476	No accomplishment.
0.0	0.357502072258	Well, Maria, I'm glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what's going on in the world.
0.0	0.393669214971	I've heard about tax schemes that don't add up, that put our kids in -- in a deeper hole than they are today.

0.0	0.420424560017	The bible commands us to let our light shine on the world.
0.0	0.36144872129	Clearly, we have to have a very specific set of actions to take.
0.0	0.640292244224	Our wages are growing faster than the national average, and I've cut taxes more than any sitting governor in this state -- $5 billion, including no taxes on small business and killing the death tax.

0.0	0.420608137226	I want to go back to what we were talking about earlier, this budget deal in Washington.
0.0	0.376355426464	You know, I sat down with the senior leadership of John Deere.
0.0	0.309000353664	The fact of the matter is we're not going to have peace -- we are not going to have peace in Syria.
0.0	0.360074522653	I would suggest to you that we need to leave the Cold War behind us, and we need to put together new alliances and new approaches to dealing with this, and we need to restrain ourselves.

0.0	0.369741599536	And that's what you expect from a leader.
0.0	0.522199662504	Well, for a start it means that police officers should not be shooting unarmed people, predominantly African-Americans.
0.0	0.39725840217	Look, under President Obama and Secretary Clinton, they're working hard to change the American dream into the European nightmare.
0.0	0.422744934051	Senator Cruz is precisely right.
0.0	0.175939806666	Yeah.
0.0	0.302598697556	It's fine if they come in, but they have to come in legally.
0.0	0.345557803586	That's not the way the game is supposed to be played.
1.0	0.477735043043	The truth of the matter is, net immigration from Mexico last year was zero.
0.0	0.394830130345	Listen, we -- this is the greatest country in the history of mankind.

0.0	0.575894363195	The insurance companies, the drug companies are bribing the United States Congress.

0.0	0.555307105553	Since I was attacked too.
0.0	0.325344482406	No, John.
0.0	0.163671312508	We need that thinking.
0.0	0.371318926821	Thanks for coming back to me, Maria.
0.0	0.0	OK?
0.0	0.393341847347	You have gotten a whole lot of money over the years from Wall Street.

0.0	0.402916612526	Donald, Donald -- can I -- I hope you reconsider this, because this policy is a policy that makes it impossible to build the coalition necessary to take out ISIS.
0.0	0.390289603916	...and be held accountable.
1.0	0.832936169328	There aren't enough good-paying jobs, especially for young people.
0.0	0.335400118936	And, PBS, thank you.
0.0	0.160361868401	I think we should do both.
0.0	0.430025313077	The simple fact is one of the ways, Maria, to solve the problem you described is narrow the number of people coming by family petitioning to what every other country has so that we have the best and the brightest that come to our country.
0.0	0.347835280414	... the fact is -- the fact is the reason why that no one wants to answer entitlements up here is because it's hard.
0.0	0.0	But...
0.0	0.385277615502	Secondly, as it relates to Iran, we need to confront their ambitions across the board.
0.0	0.434299773736	People were shocked, Trump got it.
0.0	0.0	And before I say it, I have to say this.
0.0	0.470049357314	Not committing crimes and earn legal status where you're not cutting in front of the line for people that are patiently waiting outside.
0.0	0.322323133417	And I say, look, it's not Republicans' fault, it's not Democrats' fault, it's your grandparents' fault for having too many damn kids.
0.0	0.320781384787	I have formed them.
0.0	0.400506588402	I have supported a consensus approach to solving this problem wherever it came up.
0.0	0.376970375961	But guess who pushed for that regulation?
0.0	0.321283809373	Well, thank you, John.
0.0	0.367417625171	Well, I think that there are different records.
0.0	0.575445410857	and they decide, we're going to raise it to 30 percent, plus we're going to raise the income tax to 30 percent.
0.0	0.363558415507	The answer is simple.
0.0	0.38768640642	That will never happen when I am president of the United States.
0.0	0.432714935071	In my case, whether it's health care, or getting us to debt-free tuition, or moving us toward paid family leave, I have been very specific about where I would raise the money, how much it would cost, and how I would move this agenda forward.
0.0	0.360212309632	I'm also going to take a bottle of White-Out with me to get started on all those executive orders that Mr. Obama has put his name to.
0.0	0.354011185913	Well, that's easy to answer.
0.0	0.292371713635	Because I don't think the American people are all that interested in this.
0.0	0.364413401567	But I think this is a worldwide -- that the entire world needs to come together to deal with this horrific refugee crisis we're seeing from Syria and Afghanistan, as well.
0.0	0.397151401999	I'd like to just mention something about my tax plan, and how it relates to the discussion...
0.0	0.532578006551	Almost 60 percent of American people now need to hire an expert to understand their taxes.
0.0	0.393296343767	... that, having been in the trenches fighting for this, I believe strongly we have to guarantee health care.
0.0	0.197600728804	I'll say this.
0.0	0.373901209031	But I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost.
1.0	0.523132647573	It came out recently they have equipment that is 30 years old.
0.0	0.210300418437	But let's not kid ourselves.
0.0	0.421766860721	You do legislation.
0.0	0.574737478244	It was an investment bank.
0.0	0.468116891445	I would note, just for a historic aside, somebody told me earlier today we've had like 200 presidential primary debates, and this is the first time there have been a majority of women on the stage.
0.0	0.404569097896	The question was, would you meet with an adversary without conditions?
0.0	0.211888565235	I believe we've got to go further.
0.0	0.456075168831	And it is a fact that the net immigration from Mexico and South has basically zeroed out.
0.0	0.31623879031	We don't even know that we have the cards, because our leaders don't understand the game.
0.0	0.469832928371	Instead, the Washington establishment raised both.
0.0	0.387856219516	And, I can tell, some of the candidates, they went in.
0.0	0.318981765685	You bet they do.
0.0	0.238158383278	See when you're a senator, what you get to do is just talk and talk and talk.
0.0	0.225443650158	I'll keep -- I'll keep heading in that direction, believe me.
0.0	0.396374137223	The first thing -- I don't know of anyone who's not in favor of fully vetting people that are trying to come into this country, other than perhaps Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.0	No.
0.0	0.436102346513	And I was on the front lines of that, looking into the eyes of my neighbors...
0.0	0.243076034759	So we have a unique opportunity to bring everybody together.
0.0	0.465562188326	We both listened to the information from Bush and Cheney.
0.0	0.416845570836	Now, I find it rather amazing, because I happen to believe that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country.
0.0	0.423175203643	If I'm the nominee, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.311372378753	And if you really want to believe that you can get your voice back, I will tell you, as I have all my career, I will continue to fight for you, because you're the ones that built this country, and will carry it into the future.
0.0	0.492024137251	And in fact, Kissinger's actions in Cambodia, when the United States bombed that country, overthrew Prince Sihanouk, created the instability for Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge to come in, who then butchered some 3 million innocent people, one of the worst genocides in the history of the world.
0.0	0.38215137889	But after I said that, we're not hearing so much about Hillary Clinton's e-mails.
0.0	0.335160576281	So, we do need to take on the Republicans very clearly and directly.
0.0	0.415349459931	Are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the Assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire?
0.0	0.308467136745	We don't need more of the same solutions.
0.0	0.403627242768	So I hope and pray and cannot wait until this state and others give me an opportunity to serve this party as its nominee because I will defeat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.472126947997	That is the way to deal with China at the end of the day.
0.0	0.465006252513	Ultimately, we have got to say as a nation, Secretary Clinton, is health care a right of all people or is it not?
0.0	0.582095304278	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.443466262727	The president doesn't understand -- and by the way, neither does Secretary Clinton -- and here's my warning to everybody out in the audience tonight.
0.0	0.39414322463	You sit down and you work with people, you make demands of people, in this case demanding Iran stop the support of international terrorism.
1.0	0.428698231817	And he says, the president's appointee, that crime is going up because of this.
0.0	0.200334012673	I've gotten to do some incredible things.
0.0	0.38501025072	I just think there's got to be a way, and I would hope that our tech companies would work with government to figure that out.
0.0	0.222730795332	But what -- I will tell you this.
0.0	0.186540632487	I think he would have been right.
0.0	0.374612150035	But I think on the broader question of religion and politics, you know, I think liberty, itself requires a virtue -- requires a virtuous people.
0.0	0.248169611374	Not everybody remembers that.
0.0	0.311770888287	Good evening.
0.0	0.22703729078	There's so much work that can be done, so much we've learned to do better.
0.0	0.403475310671	QUICK: Governor, thank you.
0.0	0.29947339715	Let's start with immigration and have a little bit of clarity.
0.0	0.356251908363	Carl said, "no, no -- " but he's somebody -- these are the kind of people that we should use to negotiate and not the China people that we have who are political hacks who don't know what they're doing and we have problems like this.
0.0	0.284037619592	I understand we can disagree on the path forward.
0.0	0.481264316365	Yes, well, roughly.
0.0	0.398025045809	Make ourselves stronger at home, but also our role in the world, yes, is also to confront evil when it rises.
0.0	0.269186396984	And I think we've got to be really thoughtful about how we're going to afford what we proposed, which is why everything that I have proposed I will tell you exactly how I'm going to pay for it; including college.
0.0	0.439715337816	Let me tell you what I would do immediately, day two in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.499253951004	And then on top of that, we've got a corrupt campaign finance system in which millionaires and billionaires are pouring huge sums of money into super PACS heavily influencing the political process.
0.0	0.369590968563	Then (inaudible)...
0.0	0.263597948065	You know what he said to me?
0.0	0.380914608477	But all of this has to come together when we have a positive attitude, an optimistic approach, an ability for us to set the tune as conservatives, to invite other people in to be part of that orchestra.
0.0	0.0	But what...
0.0	0.422965950837	And that is why I am pledged, if elected president of the United States, to bring about a political revolution where millions of people begin to stand up and finally say enough is enough, this great country and our government belong to all of us, not just a handful of billionaires.
0.0	0.416592380226	Well, this whole issue concerns me.
0.0	0.360020017368	And also, I've been tested in a way no one else has.
0.0	0.207995454723	But I did want to -- I wanted to follow up.
0.0	0.407885699544	Then, in 2008, you were portraying yourself as Annie Oakley and saying that we don't need those regulations on the federal level and now you're coming back around here.
0.0	0.334846636738	That's the issue that we need to tackle as Americans, and we can do it and we know how.
0.0	0.233092413996	And, I'll tell you one other thing, you know why the Republican party will want to take a chance on me?
0.0	0.447850302459	I think that is the number one requirement.
0.0	0.337792757615	And the fact of the matter is if we give them a mission and we don't tie their hands behind their back, they can get it accomplished.
0.0	0.459837669648	I far prefer that and the chances we have to be successful there than trying to start all over again, gridlocking our system, and trying to get from zero to 100 percent.
0.0	0.51717237642	And when I left, we were stronger, we were safer, and we were more united than at any time in my lifetime.
0.0	0.0	Absolutely.
0.0	0.26356046902	And it's just not going to work.
0.0	0.453949666722	And they came back with 23 recommendations.
0.0	0.215338627057	I'm the only guy on this stage -- you know, everybody has an "only guy" -- "I'm the only guy this; I'm the only guy that."
0.0	0.466647140114	If it's Medicare for all, then you no longer have the Affordable Care Act, because the Affordable Care Act, as you know very well, is based on the insurance system, based on exchanges, based on a subsidy system.
0.0	0.247808836177	All right.
0.0	0.44686704527	And based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don't add up, and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now.
0.0	0.441864790813	That the Ayatollah is a radical jihadist who really means it when he chants, "Death to America, death to Israel."
0.0	0.465336884419	Let me say first that it is disturbing that every time one of these home-grown terrorist attacks occurs, and, as your question points out, they are occurring with far too great frequency, it turns out we had warning signals.
0.0	0.417283070917	It's a disaster, and we have to protect Israel.
0.0	0.403763145809	I'm worried about bankrupting the American people.
1.0	0.771239689827	It didn't say a word about legalization.
0.0	0.306428757907	The talk has got to stop, the action has got to begin.
0.0	0.29997229496	We're going to be tough at the border, we're going to be tough on all of the illegal immigrants that everybody else in this field -- we're going to be different.
0.0	0.343808547327	We were proud of them on graduation day, but we're going to be proud every month for the rest of our natural lives.
0.0	0.414228405749	I have a debt to America I'll never repay.
0.0	0.320093073853	We need to be focusing on what fixes this country.
0.0	0.207794061973	So one of the things I did, and I said, you know what I'll do.
0.0	0.409024971942	It's their time to bail out the middle class, help our kids be able to go to college tuition-free.
0.0	0.323713162827	And that's why Monday night, what will happen here in Iowa is so important.
0.0	0.284236392746	Believe me, folks.
0.0	0.0	Yes.
0.0	0.404997056212	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.392106526817	As we all remember, Senator Obama, when he ran against me, was against the war in Iraq.
0.0	0.217536383477	Yes, I'm going to do away with that.
0.0	0.325876797877	I mean, you have great constitutional lawyers that say you can't run.
0.0	0.358281501905	But if I get elected president I will bring it back bigger and better and stronger than ever before, and we will make America great again.
0.0	0.506708740076	One of them is a statewide use of deadly force.
0.0	0.359299062268	They can solve the problem of North Korea if they wanted to but they taunt us.
0.0	0.389775521268	Crony capitalism is what happens when government gets so big and so powerful that only the big and the powerful can handle it.
0.0	0.358520371737	I would say the message that got us the win in Iowa and 10 other states against pretty overwhelming odds, is the message that's going to deliver us in this election.
0.0	0.184928668377	If not, they can stay where they are.
0.0	0.580292137	For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses closing than starting.
0.0	0.441845422423	That's why we embraced free enterprise, and it made us the most prosperous people in the history of the world.
0.0	0.415153510055	Governor Huckabee's exactly right, we need to honor the promises made to our seniors, but for younger workers -- look.
0.0	0.232950826991	I need your help.

0.0	0.259851993423	We are not France.
0.0	0.431769536791	Why in God's name does Wall Street...
0.0	0.0	But...
0.0	0.309952024967	It works very, very well.
0.0	0.0	She did.
0.0	0.363534395223	So I've said, if the big banks don't play by the rules, I will break them up.
0.0	0.28942168644	You get the Congress.
0.0	0.33760996222	But I certainly think that the United States should take its full responsibility in helping those people.
0.0	0.283904441778	So, yes, I'd absolutely would go in if he attacked.
0.0	0.447315411569	I have proposed there be a Middle East NATO so that we can combine our allies there to stand up to Iranian expansion, and at the same time join together to begin to stop and this ISIL thing before it becomes an actual state.
0.0	0.465186600063	This is one of the areas I've disagreed with Senator Sanders on, who has called for Iranian troops trying to end civil war in Syria, which I think would be a grave mistake.
0.0	0.318754644762	His family certainly believes that.
0.0	0.423222648808	In fact, one of the big banks came to me and said, "Donald, you don't have enough borrowings.
0.0	0.530367465021	But the first duty of the next president of the United States is to fix the mess at the Department of Veterans Affairs.
0.0	0.388350810305	Well, John, I come from the '60s, a long time ago.
0.0	0.0	Yes.
0.0	0.359815598637	America is back in the leadership business.
0.0	0.40208632497	But if you place good ones, you pocket it.
0.0	0.489024565993	Helping business make profits.
0.0	0.393811348899	We have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9/11, and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks, yet we see the terrible attack in San Bernardino and know that we haven't done enough.
0.0	0.314912379618	... Well, no, no.
0.0	0.563977014548	You know that the United States per capita pays far and away more than other country.
0.0	0.397339657638	Break them up.
0.0	0.301863708319	We have to stand with them.
0.0	0.461434586057	It was some of the most progressive members of the United States Congress who opposed it for that reason.
0.0	0.307062501982	They've been talking about this issue for 30 years, and nothing ever happens.
0.0	0.422391340377	When that battle was waged, my friend Senator Rubio chose to stand with Barack Obama and Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer and support amnesty.
0.0	0.417850024292	But Secretary Clinton, you've been on three sides of this.
0.0	0.351014645241	Here's the thing that I would ask Donald Trump in all seriousness.
0.0	0.36200652037	And there should be some regulation.
0.0	0.372349162777	I think the times are different now.
0.0	0.449891538448	After I'm called by 30 friends of mine who contributed to different campaigns, after I'm called by all of the special interests and by the -- the donors and by the lobbyists -- and they have zero chance at convincing me, zero -- I'll get a call the next day from the head of Ford.
0.0	0.270579843695	I have a wonderful family.
0.0	0.432127044304	This entire question was an attack, but that's (inaudible)
0.0	0.151137566978	I think we need to do a lot more than we're doing.
0.0	0.328384705781	Well, the only thing - the only thing I can go on Senator Sanders...
0.0	0.369665393814	First thing I'd tell the American people, whatever it takes to defend our nation, I would do.
0.0	0.604779679603	Our Medicare for all single-payer proposal will save the average middle class family $5,000 a year.
0.0	0.410202229152	During the Cold War -- during the Cold War, we got into a bad habit of always looking to see who was wearing the jersey of the communists, and who was wearing the U.S. jersey.
0.0	0.442936738083	I am the only person on this stage who has actually...
0.0	0.307426002442	My parents in this country were able to give me the chance to do all the things they never did.
0.0	0.259438454061	Well, I'm glad you asked that, Maria.
0.0	0.410858191145	Any connection to the fact that not one Republican candidate for president thinks and agrees with the scientific community that climate change is real and that we have got to transform our energy system?
0.0	0.251958948969	As you too know, I know I built a very great company.
0.0	0.343841363336	When you come back to me, I'll share that story.
0.0	0.456319525016	A 100, 150 years ago incredibly brave Americans said, you know what, working class kids, low income kids should not have to work in factories or on the farms.
1.0	0.513558302518	He is the foremost expert in our country on the minimum wage, and what its effects are.
0.0	0.442646615862	And that's why they have it in Europe, because it is a way to blindfolded the people, that's what Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.421827630368	The world has changed.
0.0	0.380057630359	You know, a lot of business activity in America is conducted like the guy that does my dry cleaning.
0.0	0.436634455695	Number two, this isn't me saying it.
0.0	0.0	What do we do?
0.0	0.530118024708	But much better and much less expensive for people and for the government.
0.0	0.562294145735	And those are made up of the FBI, state and local law enforcement.
0.0	1.0	Of course, you would.
0.0	0.320066967713	I think we're on the verge of the greatest time, and I want to fix the things to let people rise up.
0.0	0.224026808162	So we have work to do.
0.0	0.355832784181	He wasn't my senator.
0.0	0.532202257573	Well, first of all, I didn't say that the rate would be 10 percent.
0.0	0.578902406934	We have talked about tax reform in every single election for decades.
0.0	0.310433954365	We need to elect someone who will stand with the American people, who understands its greatness, who understands what an open economy and freedom is all about, but at the same time, has a record of being able to get things done in Washington like we've never seen before.
0.0	0.288012627881	Nobody can deny them.
1.0	0.796494560285	But I want to -- I want to follow up on something having to do with leadership, because, you know, today Senator Sanders said that President Obama failed the presidential leadership test.
1.0	0.910476187289	When President Obama came into office we were losing 800,000 jobs a month, 800,000 jobs a month.
0.0	0.451024192672	Got to be on the floor of the Senate.
0.0	0.390934412704	I will change the culture in Washington, just as I changed the culture in Tallahassee.
0.0	0.474438888549	And anyone who lies to the families of Americans who have died in the service of this country can never be commander-in-chief of the United States.
0.0	0.158447272465	I think they'd want to hear it.
0.0	0.277673411263	Probably, I don't know -- you people write the stuff.
0.0	0.368834079204	But also, I can't fake anger.
0.0	0.564716781785	So protect the Second Amendment.
1.0	0.769265928985	They were watching the humiliation of our young ten sailors, sitting on the floor with their knees in a begging position, their hands up.
0.0	0.312969770734	And if you can't use the term, you're never going to solve the problem.
0.0	0.344719812805	Make our streets safe again.
0.0	0.310734570118	The answer is no.
0.0	0.492945399833	As a member of the Health Education Committee that helped write the Affordable Care Act, much of what Secretary Clinton said about what we have done, among other things, ending the obscenity of this pre-existing situation is a step forward.
0.0	0.398786308298	We need to have stronger families.
0.0	0.440374073361	Under the rules, I have been -- I have been invoked, David, so let me respond very quickly.
0.0	0.330059851877	You've got to go the extra mile.
0.0	0.386355160807	We don't have to have refugees come to our country, but all Muslims, seriously?
0.0	0.414225675265	I believe that all of our kids should go into an income-based repayment plan.
0.0	0.372608395983	And Bill said, "No, no, she hasn't."
0.0	0.329594531532	Look at my family.
0.0	0.480909754469	Unfortunately, Governor Christie has endorsed many of the ideas that Barack Obama supports, whether it is Common Core or gun control or the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor or the donation he made to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.528919281046	Well, I would suggest a fair tax system, and that's what we have proposed.
1.0	0.546622342642	Two hundred children have been killed.
0.0	0.183308817599	But I want to go further.
0.0	0.393471579043	Jeb Bush says we've got to be willing to lose the primary in order to win the general.
0.0	0.488024774907	Why should we let their people be sitting there smoking their cigars, sitting in their comfortable chairs in Raqqa?
0.0	0.277354265491	I'll bring back our jobs, and I'll bring back our money.
0.0	0.305831847	Well, thanks for having me.
0.0	0.346551151397	You can't hide behind parliamentary tricks.
0.0	0.342364565544	Bill, I want to say one more thing about...
0.0	0.549419738701	The the truth of the matter is, big government benefits the wealthy, it benefits the lobbyists, it benefits the giant corporations.
0.0	0.377356815317	You can't send your troops into harm's way unless you give them every opportunity to be successful.
0.0	0.353174156672	The issue now is do we break them ?up do we reestablish Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.398632457584	I had to work my way through school.
0.0	0.435034855433	ISIL is trying to create themselves into a new state.
0.0	0.418467734399	So I think that we need to build on the work of the policing commissioner that President Obama impaneled.
0.0	0.459740499944	Yes, I do believe that now after the American people bailed Wall Street out, yes, they should pay a Wall Street speculation tax so that we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.362811639671	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.280213590604	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.412325393317	(LAUGHTER) Now that we've gotten the Donald Trump portion out of the way...
0.0	0.430091810505	You get the Senate.
0.0	0.0	They know.
0.0	0.395698085379	Well, because you can do it without profiling, Megyn, when you do it on the facts.
0.0	0.5	That's true.
0.0	0.490459882561	You should not have to borrow a dime to pay tuition.
0.0	0.34552893459	We've got Social Security that's going to be destroyed if somebody like me doesn't bring money into the country.
0.0	0.39762447834	It's actually evidence of the bias that exists in the American media today.
0.0	0.242609007067	And that's the difference between somebody who knows how to do this and somebody who's never done it before.
0.0	0.0	That has not been...
0.0	0.385812427684	And so that was his explanation.
0.0	0.422899788312	We disagreed on the war in Iraq.
0.0	0.271779041369	And I apologize to nobody for that.
0.0	0.314318081307	It is time to believe in America again.
0.0	0.528472736602	Just as we require every major department, every county to report its major crimes, we should require police departments to report their discourtesy, brutality, excessive force.
0.0	0.385369820802	We have people out of work.
0.0	0.456833235937	Imagine a country where the middle class can get rising income again.
0.0	0.251059917521	And I will always allow my faith to influence everything I do.
0.0	0.290415828359	Does anyone know this?"
0.0	0.289214061822	OK, just so you understand -- I know so much about trading about with China.
1.0	0.793557736109	We have the world's best military, even though he's done everything he can to diminish it.
0.0	0.285232945536	We must able to work collaboratively with others.
0.0	0.268079208028	We're going to make a really dynamic economy from what we have right now, which is not at all dynamic.
0.0	0.385514366681	But I wouldn't even waste my time with this one.
0.0	0.477746959194	That's right, three pages.
0.0	0.338544949058	If this country that does not keep its promise to seniors then what promise can this country hope to be trusted to keep?
0.0	0.357163053184	China, they don't like to tell us but they have total control -- just about, of North Korea.
0.0	0.585263657192	Jeb Bush, why have your numbers fallen?
0.0	0.205039001022	I think that's a mistake.
0.0	0.336792581706	We will work with our Sunni allies.
0.0	0.451393825029	With all the candidates, why me?
0.0	0.573343415937	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government to be setting minimum wages...
0.0	0.497454308112	You know, when Senator Sanders talks about a coalition, I agree with him about that.
0.0	0.613493907095	We're borrowing a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.439203165609	And you shouldn't have mentioned the polls because I would have been much...
0.0	0.28994476946	I don't have a super PAC.
0.0	0.648925080948	But you would index it -- you would index it to the median wage.
0.0	0.321450619978	And this is not an endeavor that rewards that.
0.0	0.448532040602	And I want us to be absolutely clear about making sure the insurance companies in the private employer policy arena as well as in the Affordable Care exchanges are properly regulated so that we are not being gamed.
0.0	0.394492532492	And just to finish, people say, how will you get Mexico to pay?
0.0	0.40530710871	I am still sick and tired of Hillary Clinton's e-mails.
0.0	0.344645423884	People are waking up because it is going to be us who will determine the direction of our country.
0.0	0.336224414355	And we need someone who will take on Hillary Clinton in November.
1.0	0.273829918351	Don't believe the 5.6.
0.0	0.481002382925	And what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice.
1.0	0.375678696451	He said, "we don't have leverage with China to get a better deal on Iran because we need them to lend us money to continue operating our government."
0.0	0.240955394862	I've gotta do it."
0.0	0.527106911136	So that is not by any stretch a pie in the sky.
0.0	0.346346246858	But it doesn't change my view that we need to empower everyone, women and men, to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make.
0.0	0.579402649351	That cost gets passed on to the people.
0.0	0.49825727012	Someone's going to be collecting this tax.
0.0	0.39691547696	And when we talk about Wall Street, let's talk about Wall Street.
0.0	0.531193580591	They said they'd shrink and balance the budget.
0.0	0.250845068171	But my wife is down here in the front, and I'm sure, if you'd like to talk to her later, she can give you more than you'll ever be able to take care of.
0.0	0.524057087449	Because this president has consistently underestimated the threat of ISIS.
0.0	0.146199404837	Who are we kidding?
0.0	0.431644359269	This is the same old stuff since I left.
0.0	0.222730795332	I will tell you that.
0.0	0.524934814619	My tax plan enables you to fill out your taxes on a postcard so we can abolish the IRS.
0.0	0.426733045736	I would not place one American life at risk unless it was absolutely necessary.
0.0	0.490796301921	They should have made it more open ended for the next president.
0.0	0.491598776382	Universal national service is an option for every kid in America to cut youth employment.
0.0	0.411103513964	And we finally have a U.N. Security Council Resolution bringing the world together to go after a political transition in Syria.
0.0	0.416004018924	We need to pay attention here in Central America as well.
0.0	0.422871962254	We have to continue to work with the Iraqi army so that they are better prepared to advance on some of the other strongholds inside Iraq, like Mosul, when they are able to do so.
0.0	0.424007177431	These are drags on the economy, it's a deliberate drag.
0.0	0.392200435592	She put America's secrets at risk for her convenience.
0.0	0.279092801766	Too often, they give up, they negotiate with themselves.
0.0	0.55104889748	Ted said he was for NSA reform, but then he told Marco Rubio, no, no, no, I voted for the bill because I'm for the government collecting 100 percent of your cell phone records.
0.0	0.584445325028	Number one, we should allow people to purchase health insurance across state lines.
0.0	0.367633410936	Because we shouldn't be policemen of the world.
0.0	0.541957778957	And what a sad sight that was: Men, women, children forced out of their homes.
0.0	0.202043704214	So I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.387151015625	There are politics in the boardroom as well.
0.0	0.417110908377	When it comes to ISIS, we will not weaken them, we will not degrade them, we will utterly and completely destroy ISIS
0.0	0.398979313975	Barack Obama believes that America is a arrogant global power that needs to be cut down to size.
0.0	0.500069404634	When those buildings came down, she was trapped in her building and I didn't hear from her over six hours.
0.0	0.316577830578	So we've got to look at the full range and then come to some smart decisions about having more streamlined and focused approach.
0.0	0.255101913662	Yes, they've got to get out of Syria.
0.0	0.294227866991	Well, let's go with three.
0.0	0.426313435399	Is creating much deeper, closer relations and, yes, coalitions within our own country.
0.0	0.464469593694	This group needs to be confronted and defeated.
0.0	0.338170412485	We have got to come forward with a consensus that in fact will work.
0.0	0.263129060425	It was a hard choice.
0.0	0.260478044322	Let me translate that for you.
0.0	0.459803807178	As president, I will support law enforcement and we'll stop radical terrorist attacks in this country by supporting our intelligence community and law enforcement community.
0.0	0.432687720766	And the reason is simple: because in 2008, we elected as president someone who wasn't interested in fixing America.
0.0	0.491136045755	But I...
0.0	0.349955989411	I hope Congress says no to this deal.
0.0	0.381839419908	It is insane to my mind, hundreds of thousands of young people today, bright qualified people, cannot go to college because they cannot afford -- their families cannot afford to send them.
0.0	0.461243166475	We are a better country than this.
0.0	0.429328812384	And as far as the Syrians are concerned, Al-Hasakah province, perfect place.
0.0	0.387721689956	So I have voiced criticisms.
1.0	0.860370450704	And Senator Sanders voted against even research dollars to look into this public health issue.
0.0	0.581876640371	So what if mass unemployment exists?
0.0	0.297680101164	And I -- I supported him because I think people, when you're elected, you need to do things.
0.0	0.315685794226	And, let me now on Social Security because we were getting into a good substantive exchange, and I want to say I think both Chris, and Mike are right.
0.0	0.447746122359	It's peanuts.
0.0	0.344945528148	And I know that term gets my Republican friends nervous.
0.0	0.247808836177	Right.
0.0	0.418850768192	We have systemic racism and injustice and inequities in our country and in particular, in our justice system that must be addressed and must be ended.
0.0	0.571637387534	So why are the pharmaceutical companies consolidating?
0.0	0.346455669414	What -- what -- you're from New York?
0.0	0.553997988557	In 2011, the sequester was passed as a reform to slow down the rate of government.
0.0	0.325344482406	John.
0.0	0.397510855176	And that's how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America.

0.0	0.172092734773	I'll check for you.
0.0	0.461391118035	But this election is not about our pedigree, this is an election about people that are really hurting.
1.0	0.895198231442	Twenty-nine million people have no health insurance today in America.

0.0	0.333344068744	It is hard to find someone in my generation that thinks Social Security will be there for us.
0.0	0.256411037833	Well, let me just say something.
0.0	0.426517219847	I honored my commitments, and as president, I will honor every commitment that I make to the men and women of this country.
0.0	0.442484890769	If the proponents of this bill actually demonstrate a commitment not to politics, not to campaigning all the time, but to actually fixing this problem, to finding a middle ground.
0.0	0.437773632235	We have to get down to creating a country that's not going to have the kind of problems that we've had with people flying planes into the World Trade Centers, with the -- with the shootings in California, with all the problems all over the world.
0.0	0.381755202883	But I recall when Secretary Clinton ran against then-Senator Obama, she was critical of him for suggesting that maybe you want to talk to Iran, that you want to talk to our enemies.
0.0	0.434473104108	I have many friends that deal with China.
0.0	0.254030656269	He's very smooth.
1.0	0.833982464847	Secondly, I think it's important to point out that about 3 percent of my donations come from people in the finance and investment world.
0.0	0.397067955759	I think with this kind of barbarism and nihilism, it's very hard to understand, other than the lust for power, the rejection of modernity, the total disregard for human rights, freedom, or any other value that we know and respect.
0.0	0.339899630125	And what we said is, if they're going to impose this on us, we better prepare to protect the state from it.
0.0	0.474463753499	President Obama's policing commission came out with some.

0.0	0.468199302079	This campaign is about the greatest country in the world and a president who has systematically destroyed many of the things that made America special.
0.0	0.682773946445	We defended the highest median income in the country.
0.0	0.398678102895	If we're gonna reform welfare for poor people, we ought to reform it for rich people, as well.
0.0	0.306865909724	The people don't work for us.

0.0	0.312863389907	We have a lot of work to do with Iran before we ever say that they could move toward normalized relations with us.
0.0	0.471397172544	But the real number, the real number is anywhere from 18 to 19 and maybe even 21 percent, and nobody talks about it, because it's a statistic that's full of nonsense.
0.0	0.322296806499	And I'll tell you what a weakness is of this country: there are a lot of people who are sick and tired because Washington does not play by the same rules that the American people have to play by.
0.0	0.468930865772	You cannot destroy ISIS with a military that's being diminished.
0.0	0.252193611399	They don't like that.
0.0	0.421993170491	That's off the table...
0.0	0.420850279476	Well, I'll tell you something: you can take everything from the top 1 percent, and you apply it to our fiscal gap, and you won't even make a dent in it.
0.0	0.529223874215	So there's more to my plan than just the cap.
0.0	0.379788292632	Let us actually go to zero- based budgeting so we know where the money is being spent.
0.0	0.478532383694	But I combine this also with the millions upon millions of dollars they've taken from regimes in the Middle East who treat women like cattle.
0.0	0.405476282213	I know that you now have your data back, and that there has been an agreement for an independent inquiry into what did happen.
0.0	0.264659943719	That's my view.
0.0	0.493897854571	Change the Mexico City policy, not take one dime of taxpayer money to fund abortion organizations overseas, and restore the NSA that's been gutted.
1.0	0.786332597295	She said that here in Iowa just two days ago.
0.0	0.310950397874	That is not what America should be about.

0.0	0.445161152107	That's when we become a country that's unsalvageable.
0.0	0.402472570402	Well, Chris, I will apologize to nobody for the vigorousness with which I will fight terrorism, go after ISIS, hunt them down wherever they are, and utterly and completely destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.274176869287	They need to learn English, adopt our values, roll up their sleeves and get to work.
0.0	0.363037541948	And by the way, I hope we can end the trade embargo with Cuba as well.
0.0	0.278163299248	And I'm not blaming these folks -- well, I guess I could.
0.0	0.381185823521	But where we have a disagreement is that I think if you look at the history of regime changes, you go back to Mossaddegh (ph) in Iran, you go back to Salvador Allende who we overthrew in Chile, you go back to overthrowing Saddam Hussein in Iraq, you go back to where we are today in Syria with a dictator named Assad.
0.0	0.205308731872	And he'll say, "Please, please, please."
0.0	0.271429566272	All of those things are important, and all those things would happen in a Christie administration.
0.0	0.400152731694	So if Ms. Davis wanted to step aside and get rid of her ability to be able to do that, there should be someone else in that office who it didn't violate their conscience so they could follow the law of the state of Kentucky.

0.0	0.53097483573	But accommodating 65,000 refugees in our country today, people of 320 million, is akin to making room for 6.5 more people in a baseball stadium with 32,000.
0.0	0.495165897517	If we are not successful, if we continue the same old, same old of Washington being run by corporate lobbyists and big-money interests, nothing changes.
0.0	0.257336903347	And I'm glad that I have a chance to answer this question.
0.0	0.451687034355	But at the end of the day, Wall Street today has enormous economic and political power.

0.0	0.183406784882	And guess what?

0.0	0.409898399654	We have the Russians and the Iranians working together, not to fight ISIS, but to prop up Assad.
0.0	0.414827335104	Well, first of all, recognize it is a substantial problem.
0.0	0.450182152117	There are a lot of people living paycheck to paycheck in Florida as well, they're looking for a senator that will fight for them each and every day.
0.0	0.377861506612	This isn't free money.
0.0	0.357260812824	So I said, "That's OK." I'm proud of my net worth.

0.0	0.210268593958	No, that's -- you're wrong.

0.0	0.355923195224	That was good for New York.
0.0	0.196144257313	But not for us.
0.0	0.428047817868	But we have a unique time in America to connect with people all around the world that understand that there's an existential threat against all of them, the Arabs, the Jordanians, the Saudis, the Egyptians, our friends in Europe, including the Turks.

0.0	0.0	It was the AFL-CIO.
1.0	0.45434258997	You know, the FBI director, the president's appointed FBI director has said this week that because of a lack of support from politicians like the president of the United States, that police officers are afraid to get out of their cars; that they're afraid to enforce the law.
1.0	0.640991738467	And I have assets -- big accounting firm, one of the most highly respected -- 9 billion 240 million dollars.

0.0	0.480718603822	We have to do away with the strawman proposal.
0.0	0.419421762813	It was our money, and we brought them back to tend to the mentally ill. Because I don't think they ought to live in prison or live under a bridge; to treat the drug-addicted so they're not in an in-and-out-of- the-door policy out of the prisons; and to help the working poor so they don't live in emergency rooms.

0.0	0.212622197884	Gosh, I'd love for us to talk about something like that.
0.0	0.408059737869	The result of that, you had the Iranian Revolution coming in, and that is where we are today.
0.0	0.45204096948	I'm against the kind of inhumane treatment that is now being visited upon families, waking them up in the middle of the night, rounding them up.

0.0	0.504614122226	Corporate inversion is one of the biggest problems we have.
0.0	0.312374504312	So let's start -- let's start with immigration.
0.0	0.449492637117	That's why George Romney, Mitt's dad, was eligible to run for president, even though he was born in Mexico.
0.0	0.530331112409	Last point.
0.0	0.391697348185	The Iranians getting more of a presence in Syria, linking with Hezbollah, their proxy in Lebanon, would threaten Israel and would make it more difficult for us to move on a path to have a transition that at some point would deal with Assad's future.
1.0	0.79630859987	He told the police, "I did it because I was inspired by ISIS," and to this day, the White House still refuses to acknowledge it had anything to do with terror.
0.0	0.419008786433	But as Bill said earlier, Roe v. Wade, it's has been the law for 42 years, and I don't think we should continue to try to change it.
0.0	0.409490834337	Look, we are fighting for every vote that we can get from women, from men, straight, gay, African-Americans, Latinos, Asian-Americans.
1.0	0.676373541656	7 percent and 8 percent to go to college?
0.0	0.323745125092	I think that sets us apart from a lot of what's happening right now on the Republican side.
0.0	0.273685292601	But I had to stand up and come back and get the best that we could.
0.0	0.290237354281	We need to make sure that people understand, as Jeb said before, that if you've done extraordinarily well in this country, do you want them to take more out of your taxes now and think they're gonna give it back to you later?
0.0	0.399651592321	Well, I agree with Rand that I very much respect Ron Paul and that I think anyone who is able to win in the Republican Party has to be able to bring together the disparate elements of the Reagan coalition.
0.0	0.493959022961	They're not supporting our law enforcement officers, it's making everybody nervous to get out of their cars, if you're a law enforcement officer.
0.0	0.63490480989	But the average person takes out about $350,000.

0.0	0.317955669845	You can't do it with empty promised.
0.0	0.370750272107	OK. You know, the Democrats who have the ultimate super PAC, it's called the mainstream media.
0.0	0.407726413333	But, I said, "This is going to be an election that's based on competence, because people are tired of these nice people.
0.0	0.414445437374	I mean, we've seen time and time again, especially in this very troubled region of nation-state failures, and then we have no idea who the next generation of leaders are that are coming forward.
0.0	0.319595559294	That's what Chris Stevens was trying to do.
0.0	0.54755334992	Reported it in the Wall Street Journal recently.

0.0	0.450116493642	I put together a coalition, including Arabs, with respect to Libya and a coalition to put sanctions onto Iran.
0.0	0.404636771888	When somebody is addicted and seeking help, they should not have to wait three, four months in order to get that help.
0.0	0.468815672738	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.473031745784	We just heard that most families haven't had a wage increase since 2001.
0.0	0.427095826911	I am against the raids.

0.0	0.413732693258	I was a child of Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.531122081468	We rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, our roads our bridges, our rail systems, we create 13 million jobs with a trillion-dollar investment.
0.0	0.461233633502	Well, I have what I call the new college compact.
1.0	0.628287625161	That billionaires pay an effective tax rate lower than nurses or truck drivers.
0.0	0.413286350852	Well, (inaudible) the major issue right now is whether or not we reestablish Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.31196274736	I couldn't have said it better myself.
0.0	0.41860865023	We're on the verge of being the first generation of Americans that leave our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.461961194722	Because they're recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees.
0.0	0.512517200889	We're bringing corporate taxes down, bringing money back in, corporate inversions.
0.0	0.451161543632	We need to be much more far thinking in this new 21st century era of -- of nation state failures and conflict.
0.0	0.209117319515	You're right.
0.0	0.246836148181	So we've got some real work to do, and let's try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the Russians.
0.0	0.256768642488	Well, I'm very happy to get a question this early on.
0.0	0.466159871532	Community banks are going out of business.
0.0	0.32872803423	Gronkowski is still going strong.
0.0	0.542785085753	The federal government should have to get warrants.
0.0	0.338225078451	But we're not gambling.
0.0	0.303246472021	That's a wonderful business model.
0.0	0.410510135829	Yes, of course Assad is a terrible dictator.
0.0	0.378841900519	But I agree with Jeb, you can't just do this by growing the economy.
0.0	0.56077917756	We should be developing oil, and gas, and coal, and nuclear, and wind, and solar, and ethanol, and biofuels.
0.0	0.360343115033	It is a disaster.
0.0	0.246461983267	And I think has had a big impact.
0.0	0.466557590317	Government is the enemy.
0.0	0.463465263928	You count on it.
0.0	0.342349738758	Our country has tremendous potential.
0.0	0.342548230506	When we put money into the hands of working people, they're going to go out and buy goods, they're going to buy services and they're going to create jobs in doing that.
0.0	0.361077812429	I'm not -- my campaign is going to be about the future of America, it's not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage.
0.0	0.44254419962	It was also the disbanding of many elements of the Iraqi army that are now showing up as part of ISIS.
0.0	0.512553340876	I'm the only person on this stage that actually was involved in the chief architect of balancing the Federal Budget.
0.0	0.392284453473	You read about all the companies now that are doing business -- about to do business in Iran, and if we don't get this settled now, with other countries in the world, about sanctions, then Iran could violate that agreement, and we're the only ones putting the sanctions on.
0.0	0.249782523166	You know, I want to go back for a moment to what we were just talking about.
0.0	0.311427785859	It's going to happen in this country, there are going to be further attacks.
0.0	0.630776239329	...10% flat rate...
0.0	0.380827738051	But John, let's not fall into the trap of thinking that all of our Muslim American neighbors in this country are somehow our enemies here.
0.0	0.393414342793	I've been held accountable for six years as the governor of New Jersey and with a Democratic legislature, I've gotten conservative things done.
0.0	0.562644666671	Yeah, we can create 13 million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure at a cost of a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.340892013772	They've got to quit sponsoring Hezbollah and Hamas.
0.0	0.294476574228	Everyone up here tonight that's talking about reforms, I think and I know for myself I speak to this, we're all talking about reforms for future generations.
0.0	0.509888327348	You will begin to see jobs created in a robust economy.
0.0	0.558891059682	Well, first of all, we're running a $2 billion dollar surplus, we're not having a revenue problem right now.
0.0	0.418371821766	But I knew that good people who wanted to be a part of the American dream have become trapped in dependency because the federal government and the state government had made it in their economic interest not to take a job because the benefits that they didn't work were better.
0.0	0.536474618164	But I look forward to signing that bill into law as president and auditing the Fed and providing needed accountability at the Federal Reserve.
0.0	0.378177105241	Sadly, the American dream is dead.
0.0	0.30556669549	I've been there 35 times.
0.0	0.353090660435	But just as importantly, and I agree with what John said.
0.0	0.389716850419	We have to obey the laws.
0.0	0.0	...
0.0	0.512499200183	After those four years of looking back and being prepared, the preparation to be the most powerful individual in the world requires an extraordinary amount of work: not just having been the governor of the 12th largest economy in the world, which I might add, we added 1.5 million jobs during that period of time over that 2007 through 2014 period, a period when America was going through the most deep recession it had been through since the Great Depression.
0.0	0.336014832193	I said, "I gotta go into Manhattan.
0.0	0.528259190535	And here's the last piece...
0.0	0.334145406094	And when it comes to the issues that are really on the front lines as to whether we're going to have equal pay, paid family leave, some opportunity for, you know, women to go as far as their hard work and talent take them, I think that we still have some barriers to knock down, which is why that's at the core of my campaign.
0.0	0.193057316433	Can you believe this?
0.0	0.235404968832	I will not do that.
0.0	0.298784178728	Now, let me ask you a question everybody, and, this is for the guy, you know, who owns a landscaping business out there.
0.0	0.399583219676	You see, you have one side, the Democrats, and with immigration, all they care about is votes.
0.0	0.296218445192	What have you got now?
0.0	0.291274698929	I don't think she's responsible for his behavior.
0.0	0.0	...Thank you.
1.0	0.513553954204	We passed it after 9/11.
0.0	0.379553515868	And here's the problem with what's going on around the world.
0.0	0.570222753477	I voted against it because the Southern Poverty Law Center, among other groups, said that the guest-worker programs that were embedded in this agreement were akin to slavery.
0.0	0.43651014227	I didn't get a phone call from Bill Clinton before I jumped in the race.
0.0	0.424649946944	Whenever they have problems, we send over the ships.
0.0	0.276939936848	Look, the -- the deal is already done.
0.0	0.468156206472	We cannot be the world's policeman.
0.0	0.21787641672	I just want a job.
0.0	0.416062686215	Companies should, if they want to attract the best workers, provide a good set of benefits.
0.0	0.50289743141	Imagine -- imagine -- if a politician were held to that standard of account.
0.0	0.381338280107	I met young people who are desperately trying to get clean and have nowhere to go, because there are not enough facilities.
0.0	0.298227292107	I've got a track record.
0.0	0.307837446715	Well, they're glitches because...
0.0	0.400323710782	And for 30 years, the issue of immigration has been about someone who's in this country, maybe they're here illegally, but they're looking for a job.
0.0	0.369657503513	Well, I think it's perfectly fair to say that we invested quite a bit in development aid.
0.0	0.477504924997	I have a strategy to combat and defeat ISIS without getting us involved in another ground war, and I have plans to raise incomes and deal with a lot of the problems that keep families up at night.
0.0	0.515688942431	They built it in about one year, this massive military port.
0.0	0.343625388895	What's crony capitalism?
0.0	0.380450197844	So look, corporations ought to exercise some responsibility.
0.0	0.329981568529	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.412424363134	You do the arithmetic.
0.0	0.541213081549	Folks, the government has no business stealing even more from the people who have paid this in.
0.0	0.303025621965	Excuse me, John.
0.0	0.386073195158	They're going to take away thousands of jobs.
0.0	0.444538794226	We took a loan against our assets to invest it in that campaign to defend ourselves against those attacks.
0.0	0.38809870944	And so, now that, I think, you know, we have resolved your data, we have agreed on an independent inquiry, we should move on.
0.0	0.318909688666	I believe we are on the path to doing that.
0.0	0.426784755402	They understand that there's a national security risk.
1.0	0.717932874033	I think it's great standing up here with the senator and the governor talking about these issues, because you're not going to hear anything like this from any of the Republicans who are running for president.
0.0	0.372267911012	We need a leader that can bring back our jobs, can bring back our manufacturing, can bring back our military, can take care of our vets.
0.0	0.412310250103	And there's a bunch of things my tax plan does to help them.
0.0	0.195402824819	Here's what I'd do.
0.0	0.391096548449	And when I'm president, we're not just going to have a president that gives a State of the Union and says America is the greatest country in the world.
0.0	0.453705735876	That's the end of the conversation.
0.0	0.355066793951	Well, if the law would change, yeah.
0.0	0.300359623515	That's how you solve the problem.
0.0	0.396314034002	You have a big lawsuit over your head while you're running.
0.0	0.517796801579	It's poor people and middle class.
0.0	0.43577797123	And it's available on paperback, if you're interested in buying my book.
1.0	0.923385134662	Senator Sanders voted to give immunity to gun dealers.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.277478992252	Let me give you the bad news.
0.0	0.365382819277	If you will join me in this campaign, we will make that a mission.
0.0	0.333046341087	I said, absolutely, you can still change the world.
0.0	0.485106754889	And the last line standing between them and our families might be us and a gun.
0.0	0.20243063269	I would not want to go to that point.
0.0	0.43626959455	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.350154140166	I want to -- before my time runs out I want to get back to this issue of ISIS versus Iran.
0.0	0.413518750519	It will end on January 2017.
0.0	0.346237166025	I ask for your support to build, together, a safer and stronger America.
0.0	0.23369495345	We're going to let people in, but they're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.386146127561	But I would want to agree with something that Senator Sanders says.
0.0	0.514742705138	Well, first of all, this is an issue that's been debated now for 30 years.
0.0	0.417968173446	So the crisis was I lost what I wanted.
0.0	0.174278385081	I feel like...

0.0	0.447816838325	And remember, the Russians have not gone after ISIS or any of the other terrorist groups.

0.0	0.440545478271	You know, we're building on Pennsylvania Avenue, the Old Post Office, we're converting it into one of the world's great hotels.
0.0	0.446063995568	The fact is -- and if for some reason he beats the rest of the field, he beats the rest of the field (inaudible).
1.0	0.830598866342	And then in Ohio, of course, I had to bring about big reform, again, because we were so far in the hole and now we just found out we are up over 400,000 jobs since I took over as governor.
0.0	0.303110050978	So, I've laid out a five-point plan about what we can do together.

1.0	0.457455099248	Well, John, look, I think that what happened when we abided by the agreement that George W. Bush made with the Iraqis to leave by 2011, is that an Iraqi army was left that had been trained and that was prepared to defend Iraq.
0.0	0.481774038694	In my view, we have got to see that weapons designed by the military to kill people are not in the hands of civilians.
0.0	0.454771290234	We agree that Wall Street should never be allowed to wreck Main Street again.
0.0	0.408202758997	I am a little skeptical about your governor actually caring enough about higher education to make any kind of commitment like that.
1.0	0.584848992129	Workforce participation rates lower than they were in 1977.
0.0	0.328003135169	Our vets may see the V.A.

0.0	0.0	Absolutely.
0.0	0.612302338905	They pay tax once overseas.
0.0	0.344020945876	Well, let's take it one at a time.
0.0	0.377855833138	You know, frankly, I did it in Washington, in Ohio, and I will do it again in Washington, if I'm president, to get this country moving again.
0.0	0.453643695495	But, I would also add this.
0.0	0.293023435277	So should the UK, so should France.
0.0	0.454614556003	I am convinced because I see how he works with his attorney general, not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.453013029614	Someone who has a proven record, who has been tested, who is totally transparent.

0.0	0.448028955403	The president has done an executive order with respect to illegal immigration that is illegal.
0.0	0.475817993491	So what I will tell you about our incentives -- our incentives are tight, and at the end of the day we make sure that we gain more from the creation of jobs than what we lose.
0.0	0.369463118926	Because for the last 24 hours, with those issues being so urgent to people as they tune in tonight, wondering how they're even be able to buy presents for their kids.
0.0	0.429622053335	And, of course, we have to continue to do what is necessary when someone like Gadhafi, a despot with American blood on his hands, is overturned.
0.0	0.264948942279	Everybody just needs to get used to it.
0.0	0.317462240521	... and say there is something more important than money.
0.0	0.369590968563	I (inaudible).
0.0	0.271084621157	It's very bad for us.
0.0	0.43542013124	This debate needs to be about the men and women across this country that are struggling on a daily basis to provide for their families the better future that we've always said this country is all about.
0.0	0.184410316734	I'm too trusting.

0.0	0.388308229578	I think, frankly, if you have border security, you can have legalization.
0.0	0.329938843651	It's because I've been assembling a team of people who want to be involved in something that's a little bigger than themselves.
0.0	0.412158819357	We've got challenges in the South China Sea because of what China is doing in building up these military installations.
0.0	0.510041577294	End -- end Common Core.
0.0	0.469445433224	Chris, let's begin by being clear what this campaign is about.
0.0	0.398368987109	Look, the truth is that a powerful nation like the United States, certainly working with our allies, we can overthrow dictators all over the world.
0.0	0.48523496518	I also believe that marriage is between one man and one woman.
0.0	0.315190606363	If you can't make a good deal with a politician, then there's something wrong with you.
0.0	0.530953439859	Thousands of people killed, and the cleanup started the next day, and it was the most horrific cleanup, probably in the history of doing this, and in construction.
0.0	0.569445067594	He's an S corporation.
0.0	0.282437506097	And now I'm building all over the world, and I love what I'm doing.
0.0	0.333917997931	So, let's stop fooling around about this, let's tell people the truth.
0.0	0.35359307876	Let me say, I read that editorial today with a great amusement.
0.0	0.352827321711	It is undermining American democracy.
0.0	0.352804125223	It isn't law-abiding gun owners.
0.0	0.351659661924	Very valuable.
0.0	0.279150064453	... And that I am not a great fan of regime change.
0.0	0.489262930564	No, the Federal Government should not play a larger role.
0.0	0.271572686594	You know, I find it really quite fascinating some of the president's proclamations.
0.0	0.468711737915	And every time we give Iraq equipment, the first time a bullet goes off in the air, they leave it.
0.0	0.350778478299	You would say maybe two, maybe four?
0.0	0.262667386317	Excuse me.
0.0	0.413331935405	Why do we continue to get ripped off by the drug companies who can charge us any prices they want?
0.0	0.335385502406	First of all, John got lucky with a thing called fracking, OK?
0.0	0.568153923048	We end up paying the highest prices in the world.
0.0	0.460744281832	Our vets are being treated horribly.
0.0	0.467434341844	Not too many years ago, Donald did a long interview with Tim Russert.
0.0	0.319293761421	If somebody's already stolen money from you, are you going to give them more?
0.0	0.301146313075	Given the fact that she's a lot smarter than me, yes, she would.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.334992265662	And I just couldn't agree -- disagree more with those kinds of comments.
0.0	0.273829918351	Don't believe it.
0.0	0.476397777733	And it is unfair simply to say how much more the program will cost without making sure that people know that, we are doing away with cost of private insurance and that the middle class will be paying substantially less for health care on the single payer than on the Secretary's Clinton proposal.
0.0	0.422386082152	... ground and air.
0.0	0.343263155528	And -- you know, all of this too big to fail stuff and picking and choosing winners and losers -- this is a bunch of crap, and it is really causing a great deal of -- great deal of problems for our society right now.
0.0	0.440110483114	They're building a military island in the middle of the South China sea.
0.0	0.395242211828	That's the book where you changed your position on immigration because you used to support a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.0	...
0.0	0.413904135913	I think issues and substance, policy and vision and record should be the meat of politics.
0.0	0.308372728589	I would just...
0.0	0.285352397898	And God bless America.
0.0	0.503850940897	And he was a managing general partner.
0.0	0.308494646341	We used to win, we don't win anymore.
0.0	0.301310987873	I don't think anybody should expand Medicaid.
0.0	0.503188077832	Now, it is true that there are a bunch of lobbyists, and a bunch of Democrats in this state spending millions of dollars trying to convince the people of Iowa that I somehow oppose ethanol.
0.0	0.279098546024	I saw them come down.
0.0	0.216255725968	We're always losing this gorgeous brand-new stuff.
0.0	0.490540354643	She has devoted her life, when I was mayor of the city of Burlington, actually when I first met her, we started a youth office, which started a after-school programs for kids, started a child care center, started a youth newspaper.
0.0	0.4269593411	We both have a lot of small donors.
0.0	0.271439529379	That's exactly what we saw.
0.0	0.482146226113	We also had attacks on two of our embassies in Tanzania, Kenya, when my husband was president.
0.0	0.508657403646	ISIS is a group that wants to trigger an apocalyptic showdown in the city of Dabiq -- not the city of Dubuque; I mis-said -- mis-said that wrong once (inaudible) time -- the city of Dabiq in Syria.
0.0	0.190012770781	It should always be going up.
0.0	0.504602092832	The major priority, right now, in terms of our foreign and military policy should be the destruction of ISIS.
0.0	0.457785853128	It's a huge public health challenge.
0.0	0.452001990179	And under the laws of this country, he wasn't allowed to be with his father for seven years.
0.0	0.235404968832	They will not.
0.0	0.421258415605	But we're running for the presidency of the United States here.
0.0	0.460183580305	Of course we have to do more to incentivize profit sharing, like we see with Market Basket right here in New Hampshire and New England, where all of the employees get a chance to share in the profits.
0.0	0.39991668099	I've a bill to fix Social Security.
0.0	0.41063060078	So this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle.
0.0	0.443879175672	And if I were president of the United States right now, I'd be lining up our allies to say that, if one crossed T or one dotted I does not occur, they are -- violate the agreement, we slap back on sanctions.
0.0	0.513361415173	We should use the debt ceiling, as precisely to Don, to force upon them budgetary reforms.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.208599394047	Well, let me tell you this.
0.0	0.487425619385	Well, first of all, under President Jeb Bush, we would restore the strength of the military.
0.0	0.418093720238	We're going to bring jobs and manufacturing back.
0.0	0.49093254899	That is some group of people.
0.0	0.499924940777	And this deal is giving him a pathway to a bomb, a missile to deliver it, and money to pay for it all.
0.0	0.327477791749	But the key thing that we're seeing now is serious challenges to this country that must change, the direction of this nation must change.
0.0	0.414542992129	And if we can do that in Texas, that 12th largest economy in the world, we can do it in America.
0.0	0.318668632445	... first of all, I'm -- don't worry, I'm not leaving the stage no matter what you ask me.
0.0	0.405683430712	This issue now has to be about stopping ISIS entering the United States, and when I'm president we will.
0.0	0.373633151354	You have regulations -- I mean, come on, they're affecting everybody here, particularly our small businesses.
0.0	0.320768531036	Yes, we need to make it easier for parents to refinance.
0.0	0.273222826813	And they wonder whether somebody is getting something to -- keeping them from getting it.
0.0	0.369766759879	... president of the United States has got to do, and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility, is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe.
0.0	0.398228954954	But we will only do so if we hold true to the values and the freedoms that unite us, which means we must never surrender them to terrorists, must never surrender our Americans values to racist, must never surrender to the fascist pleas of billionaires with big mouths.
0.0	0.298900713203	That's the kind of leadership this country needs.
0.0	0.46883654932	We have a lot of work to do, to better prepare our nation and to better lead this world into this new century.
0.0	0.507137322076	If you send a tie or a shirt made in China into the United States and an American goes to buy it at the store and there's a tariff on it, it gets passed on in the price to price to the consumer.
0.0	0.500873048203	Do not tell me that I have not shown courage in standing up to the gun people, in voting to ban assault weapons, voting for instant background checks, voting to end the gun show loop hole and now we're in a position to create a consensus in America on gun safety.
1.0	0.357109397968	It got stolen from them.
0.0	0.533135245692	I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years, and by the way, one of the members of that committee was Senator Strom Thurmond from South Carolina.
0.0	0.247808836177	Right.
0.0	0.513309477745	In the crowd today is Major General James Livingston, who's the co-chairman of my campaign here in South Carolina, a Medal of Honor recipient.
0.0	0.471636369417	Our next president, and our Republican nominee can not be someone who supports those positions.
0.0	0.495667436046	Yesterday, the president stunningly admitted this.
0.0	0.274558732101	You're not going to even allow them to come to our country?
0.0	0.422491108732	They want American soldiers on the ground fighting them, giving them many more targets, and giving them a great recruiting opportunity.
0.0	0.304188326498	We're going to have people come in, but they're coming in legally.
0.0	0.373392533256	And that's what we need to be doing to the best of our ability in our country.
0.0	0.364028411656	But like all of our problems, there isn't a single one that can't be solved with common sense if you remove the ego and the politics.
0.0	0.163356683116	It's not great again.
0.0	0.367326544867	The last thing we need is to throw our country into a contentious debate about health care again.
0.0	0.37121319263	And unlike President Obama, where he refuses even to use the term of what's going on, he can't use the term for whatever reason.
0.0	0.373319866784	That will be my mission as president.
0.0	0.285339414306	Why didn't they call?
0.0	0.454815244684	Nothing has to change for current beneficiaries.
0.0	0.554020236391	The number of women --
0.0	0.354226817279	How are these people gonna lead us?
0.0	0.321963590164	But here's the real key.
0.0	0.280213590604	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.247808836177	That's right.
0.0	0.482676152692	And I think that the record of the governor of the last 14 years of the 12th largest economy in the world is just the medicine America is looking for.
0.0	0.527400758932	In fact, Ronald Reagan's treasury, when Ronald Reagan's treasury looked at the vat tax, you know what they found?
0.0	0.452379247684	I am not a single- issue candidate, and I do not believe we live in a single-issue country.
0.0	0.180825504436	I know this, I certainly am.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.293974337863	And I'll tell you, I'm not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump.
0.0	0.470222379209	You know, we didn't start out four years ago at the top of the heap.
0.0	0.245710342979	They're protectionist.
0.0	0.437057006803	Now we're having smaller families.
0.0	0.350056156262	Well John, wait a minute.
0.0	0.368111177157	Well, our prayers are with the people of France tonight, but that is not enough.
0.0	0.200219658272	They're right about that, but I'm doing it.
0.0	0.446884419107	But today, we're the only nation on the planet that's saddling our kids with a lifetime of bills.
0.0	0.179566291602	That's good.
0.0	0.348387416042	A Republican Congress did that.
0.0	0.4253074064	And the spiraling out-of- control requires Puerto Rico to make structural reforms.
0.0	0.185497227305	They're not so stupid.
1.0	0.773419840176	They were wrong.
0.0	0.459986582662	Alzheimers, diabetes, heart disease and cancer.
0.0	0.39358358625	We can create a situation for our children to be able to get a decent job to pay down their college debt.
0.0	0.527861281082	But the best way to close this gap is to modernize higher education so Americans have the skills for those jobs.
0.0	0.319328193809	You will have welcomed my dad to preach at your churches.
0.0	0.58605746357	Seventeen more million more people have health care.
0.0	0.409357296325	You know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in America.
0.0	0.239531084009	They are not perfect.
0.0	0.386205470904	They're looking -- they're recruiting people that enter this country as doctors and engineers and even fiances.
0.0	0.0	Because I've done it.
0.0	0.285327148194	And, I'll do that with the country.
0.0	0.327585254078	I asked my dad after -- obviously, when I found out about this.
0.0	0.383154209483	And they must be part of our coalition to destroy ISIS and I believe we can get that done.
0.0	0.33172120027	I'm running for president because there is no way we can elect Hillary Clinton to continue the policies of Barack Obama.
0.0	0.463398888309	... you had two 110-story buildings come crashing down.
0.0	0.398000740854	I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators -- back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.
0.0	0.456731192383	And as president I would expand enormous energy, literally call every member of Congress that I thought I could persuade.
0.0	0.455123584735	John, this is another one of those examples.
0.0	0.170218773624	So we need 1,000.
0.0	0.438942571126	David, there are wider vulnerabilities than when it comes to refugees.
0.0	0.308667058531	And this summer, we didn't do that.
0.0	0.427283596475	And I have laid out specific plans -- you can go to my web site, hillaryclinton.com, and read the details.
0.0	0.530521644857	Why do -- why, over her political career has Wall Street been a major -- the major campaign contributor to Hillary Clinton?
0.0	0.453104508853	We have a huge mental health problem in this country.
0.0	0.169244002476	And it isn't because I'm all that great.
0.0	0.561977585685	My proposal is to put a speculation tax on wall street, raise very substantial sums of money, not only make public colleges and universities tuition-free, but also substantially lower interest rates on student debt.
0.0	0.32360261065	And people said "you can't win, you can't change the culture."
0.0	0.50697350851	I was the governor during the 9/11 attack when the Pentagon was struck.
0.0	0.45443565142	Let me tell you, Donald Trump would be a president every day of the week and twice on Sunday, rather than Hillary.
0.0	0.502030663622	But for that Texas police officer, we could have had a mass murder.
0.0	0.410944063742	In my view healthcare is a right of all people, not a privilege, and I will fight for that.
0.0	0.406928548597	So, yes, we must talk about our ideas to move our economy forward, but the first job of the president of the United States is to protect the people of the United States.
0.0	0.4947512561	We created 2,000 new jobs in the solar industry and we fought every single day to adopt more inclusive economic practices.
0.0	0.487081659438	That makes the world less peaceful, less safe.
0.0	0.340483252429	And we need to change the way we do law enforcement, and of course, we need more programs and facilities, so when somebody is ready to get help, there's a place for them to go.
0.0	0.344431917672	And, you know, that's been my message in New Hampshire.
0.0	0.258482014954	Get over that one, OK?
0.0	0.407285472275	Who can you count on to keep us safer, stronger and freer?
0.0	0.360238828618	Bernie Sanders is a socialist.
0.0	0.355131014301	It's why you see the pharmaceuticals getting together.
0.0	0.674718026572	I went into Ohio where we had an $8 billion hole and now we have a $2 billion surplus.
0.0	0.461153333084	We can end welfare for those here illegally.
0.0	0.227403887179	I'd consider it.
0.0	0.28326625241	... so you don't actually want to hear the answer, John?
0.0	0.278606163205	And I don't think you have to be a politician to tell the truth.
0.0	0.2768882642	Go to YouTube.
0.0	0.469127444859	What about hydroelectric power?
0.0	0.543773051802	And, it turns out that up until -- and this has blown me away, never in a million years would I have believed that I would be standing here tonight telling you that we have received three and a half million individual contributions from well over a million people.
0.0	0.256965032325	We know this for a fact.
0.0	0.399694099649	They need to be defeated militarily, and that will take overwhelming U.S. force.
0.0	0.461645598428	A lot of the rights that have been won over years, from women's rights to voter rights to gay rights to worker rights, will be at risk.
0.0	0.438039434934	So what we have tried to do and what President Obama succeeded in doing was to build on the health care system we have, get us to 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.30417600627	... do I go -- let me go first, and then you can please recognize Rand after.
0.0	0.400571204339	And when we live by those laws and we treat everybody equally under the law, that's when people feel good about being Americans.
0.0	0.44235597008	John, I -- if I -- a lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.419627310258	I've heard them talk about deporting 10 or 11 -- people here from this country out of this country, splitting families.
0.0	0.246137757001	And I will tell you something that really galls me.
0.0	0.278780368539	Just get me a job.
0.0	0.304540968103	I win.
0.0	0.256625376577	And guess what, in 2011, I got a deal...
0.0	0.455236850321	And if that means taking on Wall Street, I have a plan that is tough and comprehensive and praised by a lot of folks who say it goes further than what both Senator Sanders and Governor O'Malley are proposing.
0.0	0.313578378932	You know, I -- my -- my mother taught me this.
0.0	0.347423182416	It's Jesus Christ who came down to earth and died for our sins.
0.0	0.0	No, no.
0.0	0.486268663834	Here's my second problem.
0.0	0.288638823937	I waited and I got the scars to show for it.
0.0	0.473177395794	What we need now is a proven leader who has produced results.
0.0	0.335191238897	I don't want campaign contributions from corporate America.
0.0	0.228832178922	We don't know anything about that.
0.0	0.331211591648	That was a terrible mistake.
0.0	0.416266168825	We need to rebuild our military, and this president has let it diminish to a point where tinpot dictators like the mullahs in Iran are taking our Navy ships.
0.0	0.339501762614	Abroad, we need a coalition that is going to take on ISIS.
1.0	0.781096141831	Americans haven't had a raise in 15 years.
0.0	0.248397603283	You get together.
0.0	0.254677637166	That means everything.
0.0	0.0	No their not.
0.0	0.304793354058	What would we do if this were ebola?
0.0	0.342582133823	I think that what Libya then did by having a full free election, which elected moderates, was an indication of their crying need and desire to get on the right path.
0.0	0.278358132691	They're Muslim.
0.0	0.354166401165	Let people play, who cares?
0.0	0.416400952983	And those countries who are opposed to Islam, they are going to have to get deeply involved in a way that is not the case today.
0.0	0.0	Let me just say this.
0.0	0.295235129141	I promise.
0.0	0.269680962207	We have problems with Russia.
0.0	0.480843354112	People are upset about it.
0.0	0.388757086556	We need to speak to what unites us as a people; freedom of worship, freedom of religion, freedom of expression.
0.0	0.463888015434	Both Donald and Jeb have good points, and there is a middle ground.
0.0	0.531125493972	They told you that your Social Security money is in a trust fund.
0.0	0.392651240609	And if you're going to leave this to Hillary Clinton, the person who gave us this foreign policy, the architect of it, and you're going to give her another four years, that's why I'm speaking out as strongly as I am about that.
0.0	0.302568453133	But they're going to have incentive to work, because the greatest social program is a job.
0.0	0.287559326925	No, I've never made a promise like that.
0.0	0.430001519242	... (inaudible) opening statement.
1.0	0.598504977496	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.0	...
0.0	0.396521199647	But I do believe that is a minimum.
0.0	0.35989860531	I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King.
0.0	0.391394500998	I'm running for president because I'm going to create an economy that works for working families not just billionaires.
0.0	0.539791958809	All the way back to when Ronald Reagan signed a piece of legislation that basically allowed for amnesty for over 4 million people, and the border is still not secure.
0.0	0.561667397116	It begins with tax reform.
0.0	0.497821144502	It's what happened in Governor O'Malley's state.
0.0	0.319035043698	This is beyond anybody's expectations.
0.0	0.532977602774	So, I would pass legislation outlawing abortion after 20 weeks.
0.0	0.394715707318	Government causes a problem, and then government steps in to solve the problem.
0.0	0.381993096239	You look at the patches and the 40-year-old floor.
0.0	0.0	I know how to do that.
0.0	0.594545320732	We will use those proceeds, a hundred billion a year, to invest in rebuilding our infrastructure.
0.0	0.293761028377	Edward Snowden is a traitor.
0.0	0.32314226736	That's the establishment telling us to hide our conservative principles to get the left and the media to like us.
0.0	0.459830002604	Well, if that's the case, we're going to win every state, if Bernie Sanders is the nominee.
0.0	0.46049789391	I want to speak to all our fighting men and women.
0.0	0.437963403933	Here's the bottom line.
0.0	0.463890445653	Wall Street is a threat to the economy.
0.0	0.479523680026	If the United States does not lead, there is not another leader.
0.0	0.437325652793	That's the difference between China's leaders and our leaders.
0.0	0.41794027016	I don't think it's a war on women for all of us as Americans to stand up and stop harvesting organs from little babies.
0.0	0.359144414011	I -- I believe that we should make community college free.
0.0	0.586680589667	Bring the money -- the $2 trillion -- back to the United States.
0.0	0.400337503351	They have a sophisticated understanding of our legal immigration system and we now have an obligation to ensure that they are not able to use that system against us.
0.0	0.272169848	So, you know, it's fine for you to say what you're going to say, but I looked very carefully at your proposal.
0.0	0.386005292109	I mean, I heard what they both said, I saw it on the video.
0.0	0.202496845773	Go on to martinomalley.com.
0.0	0.519631250146	We grew up in a three-and-a-half-room, rent controlled apartment in Brooklyn, New York.
0.0	0.0	...
0.0	0.658438039354	We'll tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money.
0.0	0.400390864288	Yes, I do believe there must be a tax on Wall Street speculation.
1.0	0.488586135155	Twenty-one mass shootings, including one last weekend in Des Moins where three were murdered.
0.0	0.395032084678	... we will secure the border...
0.0	0.240965586611	All right, look, this has been a great debate.
0.0	0.582095304278	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.281582035432	You don't have to guess about it, because I actually have a record.
0.0	0.453013801023	And Hillary Clinton lied to the families of those four brave Americans who lost their life in Benghazi.
0.0	0.404936526883	I'm particularly keen on creating jobs in small business.
0.0	0.439349483075	And as president of the United States, it's all about communication, folks.
0.0	0.327595403368	It all will be scrutinized.
0.0	0.247808836177	That's right.
0.0	0.443217473893	No radical Islam that is allowed to engage in encouraging violence against Americans, that is not protected speech.
0.0	0.340609117133	This is a great nation.
0.0	0.416945483692	Did any of you get a phone call from Bill Clinton?
0.0	0.375416049345	Take it from Lawrence Tribe.
0.0	0.369362393484	You blindfold the American people so that they cannot see the true cost of government.
1.0	0.538832070531	I am tired of sending $300 billion overseas to buy oil from people who hate our guts.
0.0	0.479946158383	They said they would get rid of the unconstitutional amnesty.
0.0	0.223705212295	I know what it's like to owe that money, and we've worked hard.
0.0	0.428829038418	The Kurds are our strongest allies.
0.0	0.468075917199	Today, we have a legal immigration system for permanent residency that is largely based on whether or not you have a relative living here.
0.0	0.467909007781	Simply expanding Medicaid does not improve health care outcomes.
0.0	0.373058667826	That's not some sort of passe you know, antique sort of principle that safeguards our freedoms.
0.0	0.547129976232	A flat tax for everybody -- no exemptions, no deductions, no shelters, because some people have a better capability of taking advantage of those than others.
0.0	0.170726313746	Everybody knows that.
0.0	0.369445430274	They do celebrate more dependence on the government.
0.0	0.327993236625	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.541306769828	I'm running for president because we have a campaign finance system which is corrupt, where billionaires are spending hundreds of millionaires of dollars to buy candidates who will represent their interests rather than the middle class and working families.
0.0	0.346879019699	But states need to do more as well.
0.0	0.371742154733	So if -- if people who are in the private sector know what I stand for, it's what I fought for as a senator, it's what I will do as president, and they want to be part of once again building our economy so it works for everybody, more power to them, because they are the kind of business leaders who understand that if we don't get the American economy moving and growing, we're not going to recognize our country and we're not going to give our kids the same opportunities that we had.
0.0	0.219101647079	But this is what I do believe.
0.0	0.454525521841	Are you fed up with how Washington wastes your money?
0.0	0.486383944211	When you look at raising the debt limit, it should be leverage to try to reform government.
0.0	0.546445167484	There is no money, it's a stack of paper.
0.0	0.389341412109	And places like Seattle, like Los Angeles, like New York City, they can go higher.
0.0	0.391465025455	I don't think anybody has cut that much government anywhere, at any time.
0.0	0.535504335981	And if they have to be in the Middle East for 20 or 30 years no problem.
0.0	0.377673808452	Our symbol is the Statue of Liberty.
0.0	0.43604497973	It's saved a lot of lives along the way, Senator.
0.0	0.497350903822	Well, to put that in a context, Judy, I think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top one-tenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.317002417126	They believe some are smarter than others, some are better than others, so some are going to need to take care of others.
0.0	0.286363021473	And, that's why tonight I'm asking you for your vote.
0.0	0.381079400151	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.274803044705	And when I'm president, we are going to bring it under control once and for all after 30 years of talking about it.
0.0	0.252526521429	Well I want to comment on this.
0.0	0.314912379618	Well, I did.
0.0	0.275099892886	I mean, Chris will know about that.
0.0	0.195985747147	Please go to berniesanders.com.
0.0	0.410529034254	The fact that it's happened for so many people here throughout our history, that's what makes us special.
0.0	0.515730918395	I watched that town hall meeting with the Democrats the other night, and I heard Hillary Clinton asked a direct question by an Iowan, and that's what Iowans like to do.
0.0	0.319154896164	Well, you need somebody, because politicians are all talk, no action.
0.0	0.337568390782	The majority of people in American actually have values and principles and they believe in the very things that made America great.
0.0	0.468815672738	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.362215020365	Well, you know, I think, from a historical point of view, somebody with my background, somebody with my views, somebody who has spent his entire life taking on the big money interests, I think a Sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment, as well.
0.0	0.0	And you know what?
0.0	0.142893629093	Talk about what?
0.0	0.309547980718	What you saw was a parade of, "I'll give you this for free; I'll give you that for free."
0.0	0.288299054709	And work on a timetable to get rid of Assad, hopefully through Democratic elections.
1.0	0.513436336494	I never filed for bankruptcy.
0.0	0.281628878097	I don't blame Hillary Clinton at all for this.
0.0	0.49426258855	If an American missionary has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.586486946816	... saying, no middle class tax raises.
0.0	0.0	We haven't.
0.0	0.438856082384	We have to protect our 2nd amendment and you cannot do this and certainly what Barack Obama was doing with the executive order.
0.0	0.268628571166	There won't be any -- you can get it.
0.0	0.424149452086	So they come in, they take our jobs, they take our money, and then they loan us back the money, and we pay them in interest, and then the dollar goes up so their deal's even better.
0.0	0.247808836177	All right.
0.0	0.552730871284	You just see the recent deal announced today or yesterday, more spending, more tax increasing, more regulation.
0.0	0.327280289705	How stupid are these politicians to allow this to happen?
0.0	0.361137008462	I want those kids to know that if they study hard, they do their homework, regardless of the income of their families, they will in fact be able to get a college education because we are going to make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.351897823085	You know, you claim it is tough talk to discuss carpet bombing.
0.0	0.329002064795	This is a war for the soul of Islam.
0.0	0.343625388895	That's crony capitalism.
0.0	0.302888953682	I know that; I've been dealing with them for a long time.
0.0	0.340775649422	And, when I hear people talking about means testing, let's just remember what that means.
0.0	0.343194444664	Just ditto to that.
0.0	0.363082991728	I guess I'm part of the establishment Barbara Bush is my mom.
0.0	0.337465034551	The only way we're going to defund Planned Parenthood is have a pro-life president.
0.0	0.28221485613	But I think it's the right road for us to try to travel.
0.0	0.360398401405	I will be the Ronald Reagan if I can find a Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.260521502047	He said, "You know, I make great product."
0.0	0.356727742135	And then the Government steps in to try and solve the problem and we get a little further down to that progressive vision that Hillary Clinton is talking about.
0.0	0.446888227715	Obviously, in the first, we do have to have a -- an American-led air campaign, we have to have Arab and Kurdish troops on the ground.
0.0	0.436060690079	That's basically bordering on a miracle because of our great prison director.
0.0	0.467727850846	Well, Secretary Clinton, you're not in the White House yet.
0.0	0.479968316755	And the issue is, the problem is, the front pages every day were dealing with it.
0.0	0.230108036251	Because that's what we'd get if it were Jeb -- I tell you what, we don't need that.
0.0	0.477150730071	As governor, we continued to work together.
0.0	0.0	...
0.0	0.508944594457	Whose fault is it that Medicare is broken, out of money, that Social Security is broken, out of money?
0.0	0.327587663125	So, are we going to ban Muslims from India, from Indonesia, from countries that are strong allies -- that we need to build better relationships with?
0.0	0.331714201374	The American people are never going to trust Washington, D.C., and for good reason.
0.0	0.175939806666	Yeah.
0.0	0.515014299336	It basically gave the gun lobby even more power to intimidate legislators, not just in Washington but across the country.
0.0	0.1672568433	That's really nice.
0.0	0.274294394739	That's what I said.
0.0	0.597960495333	Last week in a CNN town hall, the Senator told a questioner that the questioner would spend about $500 dollars in taxes to get about $5,000 dollars in healthcare.
0.0	0.426751067635	We need to lead a force, a Sunni led force inside of Syria.
0.0	0.27829006433	But, here is the truth.
0.0	0.407342197027	Three times, she refused to answer the question, because she refuses to be held accountable for anything that goes wrong.
0.0	0.395700046703	You don't have seven children and bring them into this world if you're not optimistic about the future of this country.
0.0	0.547609359218	My budget was mentioned.
0.0	0.317565806008	We don't have victories anymore.
0.0	0.338243195121	...The only way we're going to be morale, the only way we're going to keep our promise to seniors is start by following the first rule we should all follow, which is to look at them, treat them like adults, and tell them the truth.
0.0	0.36733220223	A terrible sight.
0.0	0.321977312134	In fact, sometimes it's not that way...
0.0	0.541453038158	It means that we end minimum sentencing for those people arrested.
0.0	0.557920607787	We have a $19 trillion bipartisan debt and it continues to grow as we borrow money from countries that do not like us to pay for government we cannot afford.
0.0	0.167139386207	I do not think it would come to that.
0.0	0.350932376418	And, you know, for six-and-a-half years, we've had a gigantic party.
0.0	0.299748759436	They don't like NBC, but I like the poll.
0.0	0.546708923678	And aligned with a corrupt campaign finance system is a rigged economy.
0.0	0.196883645555	They do whatever what they do, OK.
0.0	0.49747015023	And, if this government doesn't pay it, than tell me what's different between the government and Bernie Madolf, who sits in prison today for doing less than what the government has done to the people on social security and Medicare in this country.
0.0	0.173941470399	And that's really a theme of a lot of the things that I'm talking about.
1.0	0.883149479662	I have vetoed a reduction this clip size.
0.0	0.457011548867	It's a blessing that we're living longer, so we have to increase the retirement age to reflect that blessing.
0.0	0.413919419543	And in talking to a lot of our neighbors who are in that super wealthy, millionaire and billionaire category, a great numbers of them love their country enough to do more again in order to create more opportunity for America's middle class.
0.0	0.540250393794	But yes, there is more collaboration required between private sector companies and the public sector.
0.0	0.374958279483	If you're worried about the world being on fire, you're worried about how we're going to use our military, you're worried about strengthening our military and you're worried most of all about keeping your homes and your families safe and secure, you cannot give Hillary Clinton a third term of Barack Obama's leadership.
0.0	0.439151965738	And what I have concluded is that the best policy is to get rid of all government subsidies, and get the government out of our lives, and let people rise and fall based on how good they are.
0.0	0.304853199634	I feel like I need -- I feel like I need a Washington to English dictionary converter, right?
0.0	0.484585138224	We're going to combine all commercial activity in business into one place in the tax code and charge it 15 percent, which is going to suddenly make us competitive with the rest of the world.
0.0	0.348655311062	I very much appreciate that comment, Bernie.
0.0	0.287753016607	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.35733385449	But the process should move forward while we are also taking on ISIS, putting together the kind of strategy that I've advocated for, and making sure that the vetting and the screening is as tough as possible.
0.0	0.303918091846	Maria...
0.0	0.379022513764	If it's not me in the position, it's one of these politicians that we're running against, you know, the 400 people that we're (inaudible).
0.0	0.21208249319	And I'll tell you one thing that we never talk about -- we haven't talked about it tonight.
0.0	0.334644049429	...Chris...
0.0	0.434355366589	Never have and never will support any effort to grant blanket legalization amnesty to folks who have entered, or stayed in this country illegally.
0.0	0.291275114625	There are ways to retrain the 50 and 51-year-olds, because they've got great value.
0.0	0.48121270612	Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well.
0.0	0.342499822535	It is Iran that's the expansionist power.
0.0	0.367210459476	We need to make police departments look like the communities they serve in terms of diversity.
0.0	0.336439873216	We need to focus our energies there, not these broad, blanket, kind of statements that will make it harder for us to deal with ISIS.
0.0	0.221999224098	That I can tell you.
0.0	0.394149837071	It's not the evil rich people.
0.0	0.247808836177	All right.
0.0	0.403226519688	Somebody who is very fond of the president, agrees with him most of the time, I disagree with his recent deportation policies.
0.0	0.480030703294	Not just the hacking of OPM, but that is -- that is just shameful.
0.0	0.171967417126	Whoa.
0.0	0.329662952586	That's a serious issue that we could work on.
0.0	0.385212850692	Sometimes it's a complicated situation, but some things are black and white.
0.0	0.493094827752	They explode the bomb, we have an electromagnetic pulse.
0.0	0.399236411786	And I'm not standing here today and saying that Libya is as far along as Tunisia.
0.0	0.516678780322	We actually raised it to the highest goals of any state in the nation also in minority and women participant goals because we understood that the way you reinvigorate and make fair market American capitalism work, is to make the choices and the investments that include more people more full in the economic success of your state.
0.0	0.524387076659	Thousands.
0.0	0.37204949781	I was governor of New York on September 11.
0.0	0.346568972254	That was not, as I understand it, the secretary's position.
0.0	0.462170656229	Because of a series of disastrous trade policies which have allowed corporate America through NAFTA and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, Secretary Clinton and I disagree on those issues.
0.0	0.300134372006	Why don't you wait in line?
0.0	0.323171268767	Does my family like me?
0.0	0.276412480239	All we need to do is protect them, they will be in their own country.
0.0	0.422793542609	First of all, I'd like to recognize Governor Haley for her incredible leadership in the aftermath of the --
0.0	0.414441205505	You know, one of our biggest national security issues is the world looks at us some time, and we look at each other and say, why can't we solve problems?
0.0	0.278060827492	And the reasons why I've done is I don't believe we have a good process of being able to vet them.
0.0	0.414462494384	Military action, Maria, would be used when it was absolutely necessary to protect American lives and protect American interests around the world.
0.0	0.423569837383	I think it's great that Senator Sanders, President Obama and I have more donors than any three people who have every run, certainly on the Democratic side.
0.0	0.310412588999	There's a lot packed into that statement.
0.0	0.444287778068	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.303678624419	I think there is a consensus.
0.0	0.475870171773	And yet when he won, he turned to me, trusting my judgment, my experience, to become secretary of state.
0.0	0.355755921734	But the reason America is a great country, the reason is because our compassion is in our laws.
0.0	0.566463021681	It is imposed on business and a critical piece that Marco seems to be missing is that this 16 percent business flat tax enables us to eliminate the corporate income tax.
0.0	0.287274850686	I'll give you another example.
0.0	0.506709964686	Because we have found a way to reduce hospital costs, so whenever we come...
0.0	0.410510308316	He's the greatest show on earth.
0.0	0.329439657209	I've been to Ferguson, I've been trying to look for solutions to our criminal justice problem.
0.0	0.465196232455	And I agree with much of what the secretary and the governor have said.
0.0	0.268594132926	I think it's important we put this in historic context.
0.0	0.146812056585	That's what I think we need to do.
0.0	0.0	...
0.0	0.383097394344	For too long -- no, for too long, what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our people's jobs, and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us.
0.0	0.461428400723	... that's the -- that's the false choice in this whole debate about immigration.
0.0	0.416626035945	And the world, no doubt is a better place without him.
0.0	0.500209454852	The government has lied to you and they have stolen from you.
0.0	0.533027599892	It was the first time we did it since man walked on the moon.
0.0	0.435038809654	But I think there has to be recognition that if we -- if we are too punitive, then you'll go to other -- other technology companies outside the United States.
0.0	0.377868377394	The Europeans have moved on.
0.0	0.334644049429	Chris...
0.0	0.414357992625	We need to be very well aware of the fact that China and Russia are using technology to attack us, just as ISIS is using technology to recruit those who would murder American citizens.
0.0	0.195775208896	I want a job."
0.0	0.435291892336	That has to be enforced absolutely with consequences for Iran at the slightest deviation from their requirements under the agreement.
0.0	0.383595057774	The millionaires and billionaires are doing great under Obama.
0.0	0.36444033495	But I was born here.
0.0	0.362261586276	And I feel very strongly that I have an agenda, I have a record that really does respond to a lot of the specific needs that the women in our country face.
0.0	0.368161957454	It will be fly-to country.
0.0	0.402673226347	And it was with us for months, the smell, the air.
0.0	0.446679455648	My plan is to make it work, to tell Saudi Arabia that instead of going to war in Yemen, they, one of the wealthiest countries on Earth, are going to have to go to war against ISIS.
0.0	0.488478873064	I will break up these banks.
0.0	0.34801749917	This is a bad deal.
0.0	0.528107383079	Why does the pharmaceutical industry make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.245017781523	And I'll tell you, it was heartbreaking.
0.0	0.47248806837	We're one of the fastest growing states in the country.
0.0	0.244259648515	She never lived to see that.
0.0	0.302372686129	They were smarter than our leaders.
0.0	0.248606936934	I said, "I don't need it.
0.0	0.559607214145	You had two one hundred...
0.0	0.452302138871	We're going to suspend and repeal every executive order, every regulation that cost American jobs and is -- is -- is impacting our freedom.
0.0	0.538140899351	My point is this: I won two landslide elections, I made big changes.
0.0	0.594903044422	We do not have to have massive levels of income and wealth inequality.
0.0	0.517619999838	No, it's your record.
0.0	0.417989538434	This is absolutely disgusting, and revolts the conscience of the nation.
0.0	0.383309217512	And frankly, if you want to be commander in chief, you have to have the experience.
0.0	0.175809529211	I'm going to tell you -- thank you.
0.0	0.521128632931	She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video.
0.0	0.496276857801	In this building, in Trump Tower.
0.0	0.335916147291	So look, in foreign policy -- in foreign policy, it's strength, but you've got to be cool.
0.0	0.320116204147	I am advocating the no-fly zone both because I think it would help us on the ground to protect Syrians; I'm also advocating it because I think it gives us some leverage in our conversations with Russia.
0.0	0.438945152409	Now, when Secretary Clinton says, "I'm not going raise taxes on the middle class," let me tell you what she is saying.
0.0	0.305547775982	Then he'll call all sorts of political people, and I'll say, "Sorry, fellas.
0.0	0.472021771372	That means medical.
0.0	0.25007389579	And he said, oh, I'm never going to attack.
0.0	0.401684056466	We're going to have too many people in the cart rather than pulling the cart.
0.0	0.43668227014	We the people of the United States in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare and secure the benefits of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this constitution of the United States of America.
0.0	0.47566199283	What we need to do is take the rest of the federal entitlements, not just welfare, but food stamps and Medicaid and housing programs and do the same thing we did with welfare.
0.0	0.429996569285	Since he has changed his mind on amnesty, on health care and on abortion, I would just ask, what are the principles by which he will govern?
0.0	0.434826989657	The simple fact is, we all have a record.
0.0	0.491427449406	And worse -- worse yet, to be honest with you, Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster.
0.0	0.413851420532	I'd sign that executive order.
0.0	0.0	And second of all...
0.0	0.479241605963	Every penny we needed from -- every penny we got from Social Security, because my sister was a minor, we needed.
0.0	0.25267798263	We need a collaborative approach.
0.0	0.437550520222	Every time we send signals like this, we send a signal of weakness, not strength.
0.0	0.343900562701	We're going to take the political handcuffs off the military.
0.0	0.197001651554	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.457557777347	There are other ways to lead and to be a moral leader in this world, rather than at the opposite end of a drone strike.
0.0	0.411718262914	For her convenience.
0.0	0.217633695718	But most importantly, when you look at what happened in the 1990s, go to berniesanders.com.
0.0	0.385618439402	Martha, we got a lot of politicians that will kiss babies, cut ribbons, do whatever it takes to be popular.
0.0	0.518928516603	The bill would involve legalization.
0.0	0.593434750979	Our average contribution is $27 dollars, I'm very proud of that.
0.0	0.233529490098	...No, sir...
0.0	0.363076634542	He's not arming the Kurds.
0.0	0.34406162434	I'm a Catholic, I believe life begins at conception.
0.0	0.379052996536	The natural next question is who actually has done so.
0.0	0.637307180906	They make a billion dollars a day.
0.0	0.415706278975	Well, you know, governor, I know that when you had a chance to appoint a commissioner for financial regulation, you chose an investment banker in 2010.
0.0	0.427244466065	We are at war with violent extremism.
0.0	0.491361236358	Now in terms of their really stunning hit piece, what they mentioned is when I was running for senate -- unlike Hillary Clinton, I don't have masses of money in the bank, hundreds of millions of dollars.
0.0	0.495630049535	I voted against the war in Iraq because I listened very carefully to what President Bush and Vice President Cheney had to say and I didn't believe them.
0.0	0.448424536641	This isn't just the country I was born in, this is the nation that literally changed the history of my family.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.338704815637	If you'll answer the (inaudible) core question.
0.0	0.0	Absolutely.
0.0	0.311482668914	You gotta be patient.
0.0	0.547322983591	The Democrats' answer to everything is more government control over wages, and more empowering trial lawyers to file lawsuits.
0.0	0.317525944193	Come with me to Iraq and Afghanistan, folks.
0.0	0.477995390815	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.388933798239	This is a guy who just believes that law enforcement are the bad guys.
0.0	0.377890447471	How stupid are our leaders?
0.0	1.0	I never said that.
0.0	0.357327315538	But as president, I will spend even more time thinking about the futures of all the kids and the grandchildren in this country because I want to make sure every single child has a chance to live up to his or her God-given potential.
0.0	0.0	May I respond?
0.0	0.466381104809	That very first time they show up with a near miss, we should be intervening there.
0.0	0.620069164097	If we were to raise the marginal rate to 45 percent for people earning more than a million dollars and if we tax capital gains essentially the same we do earnings from hard work and sweat and toil, you could generate $800 billion over the next ten years and that would do so much good for affordable college, debt-free college, cutting youth unemployment in half, investing in our cities again.
1.0	0.422439454489	He's not wall street.
0.0	0.293141403337	And that is what they told me when I was in Jordan in November.
0.0	0.203575874656	I can do that.
0.0	0.453422016175	And now what we have is a whole stretch now, of the coast of Libya, 100 miles, 150 miles, that has now become potentially the next safe haven for ISIL.
0.0	0.325344482406	So was I, John.
0.0	0.523361255693	And then we saw that the leading candidates for president at the time, both the Republican and the Democrats, all supported it.
0.0	0.466031126387	And make sure you enhance savings in the private market.
0.0	0.313775617324	And that's the way it is.
0.0	0.407224302059	I would want us to take our place among the nations of the world to alleviate this sort of death and the specter we saw of little kids' bodies washing up on a beach.
0.0	0.568203212723	Number two, we should expand health savings accounts so people can save in a tax-advantaged way for more routine healthcare needs.
0.0	0.27134390621	But you know, here's the real issue, is this America anymore?
1.0	0.540877881656	He has called him a disappointment.
0.0	0.408964047487	The reason all of us are here is we believe we should be fighting for the working men and women of this country, and not Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.379333785533	Judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.477641651486	This campaign is not just about electing a president.
0.0	0.379546210904	They can't even answer simple questions.
0.0	0.439594887253	I would sign an executive order protecting religious liberty, our first amendment rights, so Christian business owners and individuals don't face discrimination for having a traditional view of marriage.
0.0	0.549949739445	And that's an economy where ordinary Americans are working longer hours for low wagers.
0.0	0.385749188825	And I am very grateful for all my predecessors and my successors because each of them not only did what she could to support her husband and our country but often chose to work on important issues that were of particular concern.
0.0	0.276708270994	I'm going to prioritize those recipients who need the most help first.
0.0	0.448218129121	But we allowed people to keep health care.
0.0	0.302390702257	If that's a blind trust, I don't know.
0.0	0.379168955475	They're concerned that Washington is so dysfunctional it is holding them back.
0.0	0.288317032961	And that is wrong.
0.0	0.364408786575	It is not a radical idea to say that a single mom should be earning enough money to take care of her kids.
0.0	0.418752423363	And there is no nation on the planet better able to adapt to this change than our nation.
0.0	0.467354046635	I think what our campaign is indicating is that the American people are tired of establishment politics, tired of establishment economics.
1.0	0.444271339307	I don't recall the Sun -- in fact, the Sun-Sentinel endorsed him.
0.0	0.373265732107	It has to be based on what skills you have, what you can contribute economically, and most important of all, on whether or not you're coming here to become an American, not just live in America, but be an American.
0.0	0.492432325571	But mostly, the highest calling of leadership is to challenge the status-quo and unlock the potential of others.
0.0	0.438793388906	You can get it at $2.99 on Amazon.
0.0	0.243044869725	We just want to be the rich."
0.0	0.410932685242	We saw a dictator overthrown.
0.0	0.304095587019	Divisive and with no vision.
0.0	0.349800605461	And we keep young people on our policies until they turn 26.
0.0	0.41277341151	Here's -- here's our plan.
0.0	0.304366686066	Well, yes, indeed.
0.0	0.450858104459	You see something that's suspicious, you call law enforcement and let law enforcement make those decisions.
0.0	0.352707954971	I said, "They send it back?"
0.0	0.295948188638	We need money.
0.0	0.533231468393	That is why I'm going to have a tax on Wall Street speculation to make certain that public colleges and universities in America are tuition free.
0.0	0.358345225443	Let me give you one quick example.
0.0	0.0	Say again?
0.0	0.29570368843	They do not get any credit for their care-taking responsibilities.
0.0	0.457715544002	I ran for office to make the generational changes in Louisiana.
0.0	0.273207103764	So did you, Marco.
0.0	0.449348568506	Now hundreds of companies I've opened.
0.0	0.355392697632	Over time, we're going to become energy independent.
0.0	0.34539879991	I think it's a wonderful that that businesses start a 401(k).
1.0	0.626948552758	When I look at the migration, I looked at the line, I said it actually on your show recently, where are the women?
0.0	0.0	...
0.0	0.271788931234	I would invite him, I actually would say.
0.0	0.450861106329	I believe the world is a safer and a better place when America is the strongest power in the world.
0.0	0.57122048026	I voted for comprehensive immigration reform in 2007.
0.0	0.368766708315	We have people that don't have it.
0.0	0.437211734783	You know, Obama has presented the American people with a false choice every time.
0.0	0.327648971111	But somehow for decades, nothing really has changed.
0.0	0.300812056238	We're going to create a border.
0.0	0.305383947719	They're a scam.
0.0	0.178851474517	And, I'll tell you something else.
0.0	0.377380383209	And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word.
0.0	0.278259409268	I don't think the term is what's important.
0.0	0.439943661406	They were paid speeches.
0.0	0.40654487403	I want immigration reform to pass.
0.0	0.522920649266	And if our middle class makes more money, they spend more money, and our whole economy grows.
0.0	0.429437950368	And everything is costing more money, and we are killing our -- our -- our people like this.
0.0	0.362314210281	It's "give me options on how I can make it harder for law-abiding people to buy guns."
0.0	0.353417485687	Never support.
0.0	0.443534944028	I'm the only one on this stage that has a plan that would create jobs, cut taxes, balance the budget and can get it done because I'm realistic.
0.0	0.459355982199	No, I said, " I would use -- " they were asking me what to do about North Korea.
0.0	0.392823910926	We need to embed with -- with the Iraqi military.
0.0	0.0	...
0.0	0.476486350642	Now, you can support one now that's very low.
0.0	0.371957947086	To get the information from Hillary Clinton, you need to get a subpoena from the FBI.
0.0	0.321324986836	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.248306931049	And that's what i hope, there can be some understanding and cooperation to achieve.
0.0	0.356681409083	We need to do it now as a nation.
0.0	0.192653022452	But furthermore, what we have got to do, I'm sorry, yes, I do believe that we have got to do everything that we can, and it will not happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.466623373689	It's what we did in the first Persian Gulf war; 1,100 air attacks a day, saturation bombing that utterly destroyed the enemy.
0.0	0.305027071898	It goes away.

0.0	0.26973925336	He got lucky with fracking.
0.0	0.507706402949	I have a concrete plan to do just that, which allows people to keep HSAs to encourage savings, it allows for people that are retiring with Social Security to be able to get a minimum of 125 percent of the poverty level so that there is a baseline that in this generous country of ours no one goes below.

0.0	0.437099202181	And I was proud to get the endorsement of Mayor Walsh of Boston, who has made his struggle with alcoholism a real clarion call for action in this arena.
0.0	0.428624428833	It's not only offensive; it's dangerous.
0.0	0.300413965914	I would take the fight to these guys, whatever it took, as long as it took.
0.0	0.2853976388	Thank you for that question.
0.0	0.483721227766	We have to get the other 10 percent of the way to 100.
0.0	0.417076042193	We need to rebuild the military to defeat the enemy.
0.0	0.30917080871	We need to figure this out together.
0.0	0.43300436418	And I just want to say, you know, last week we released our tax plan.
0.0	0.332727156587	So I'm going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of Americans fulfilling their potential, because I don't think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single American to live up to theirs.
0.0	0.365084880141	And I think what the president has consistently said-- which I agree with-- is that we will support those who take the fight to ISIS.
0.0	0.246506092768	I don't have to brag.
0.0	0.0	Absolutely.

0.0	0.380907145905	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.363681788139	And in your heart of hearts, you cannot wait to see a debate between Hillary Clinton and Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.410975766472	And I will go back and say again, AIG was not a big bank.
0.0	0.467216168987	I've also called for the end of family detention, for the end of privately-run detention centers, along with private prisons, which I think are really against the common good and the rule of law.
0.0	0.347604407843	I buy it, because, frankly, I have an obligation to buy it, because they devalue their currency so brilliantly, they just did it recently, and nobody thought they could do it again.
0.0	0.243286305023	Those are all really positive developments.
0.0	0.429014234582	The NSA is another big issue.
0.0	0.370757242927	I did a couple of speeches for them, I do speeches for other people.
0.0	0.330524150869	You know, need to stop allowing political correctness to dictate our policies, because it's going to kill us if we don't.
0.0	0.351709353362	That's the truth of the matter and you see it every time with this president.
0.0	0.317142810114	I would like to take a hard look at every part of the federal government and really do the kind of analysis that would rebuild some confidence in people that we're taking a hard look about what we have, you know, and what we don't need anymore.
0.0	0.355535079513	It was a different situation in Afghanistan.
0.0	0.33866872662	Revolution never came.
0.0	0.478350481872	The simple fact is that the plane that's being build here is being sold to China.

0.0	0.221686395177	We don't need anything.
0.0	0.421458943033	Actually a close friend.
0.0	0.338042645435	So Ford will come back.
0.0	0.35174448216	Well, I'm sorry that whoever tweeted that had that impression because I worked closely with New Yorkers after 9/11 for my entire first term to rebuild.
0.0	0.277169910596	I love China.
0.0	0.250642193607	Not the change we need at a time we need it.
0.0	0.305290568277	Marco can change his mind.
0.0	0.440343997798	ISIS has now attacked a western democracy in -- in France.
0.0	0.400307050992	My sister was a single mom, both of my aunts who were a single moms.
0.0	0.435666590012	So as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and the like.
0.0	0.417445037506	Sometimes you win a war by killing murderous, evil terrorists.
0.0	0.510874175615	Sometimes it's because the Federal Reserve kept interest rates so low that the wealthy were able to invest in -- in strong assets like the stock market when everybody else was left behind.
0.0	0.26465355986	Well, as anyone knows who's been listening to me, you know?
0.0	0.435043015112	Martha, may I -- Martha, may I...
0.0	0.337526883044	We don't eliminate Medicare.
0.0	0.277096125736	I think we should be for free trade but I think fair trade.
0.0	0.354557053492	Whoever heard of this?
0.0	0.467341430522	He's weak on immigration.
0.0	0.579294116622	So yes, I will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year pay zero, zero in federal income tax.
0.0	0.373606523933	And I'll tell you what, Donald, you -- you very kindly just a moment ago offered me the V.P.
0.0	0.452872390877	So, just to sum up, I would do various things very quickly.
0.0	0.260228720992	Look, I have said I want to be the president for the struggling, the striving and the successful.
0.0	0.411076264426	And I come in from China and I come in from Qatar and I come in from different places, and they have the most incredible airports in the world.
0.0	0.455758070837	We both made the identical promises.
0.0	0.3260401897	Let me just close it out this way.
0.0	0.501207230323	Not only are deductibles rising, 29 million Americans still have no health insurance and millions of people can't afford to go to the doctor.
0.0	0.21414806445	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.484107599158	... Mr. Trump believed that in reaction to people's fears that we should ban all Muslims.
0.0	0.225051416568	We never dreamt we'd ever see it."
0.0	0.312795829243	So the indignation that you carry on, some of the stuff, you have to also own then.
0.0	0.453404906291	It's the most exceptional country the world has ever known.
0.0	0.362811639671	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.223741186803	So I said to myself, you know, nobody's ever going to know unless I run, because I'm really proud of my success.
0.0	0.231866393665	They're a great family.
0.0	0.343538984492	People who we should be welcoming and working with.
0.0	0.488267910161	Are you concerned like I am that the debt and deficits of Washington, D.C. are endangering America's future?
0.0	0.465196232455	And I agree with much of what the Secretary and the Governor have said.
0.0	0.51980676067	We're talking about a state that moved graduation rates forward from 27th in the nation to second-highest.
0.0	0.32538604917	And I was going to tell you, whether I'm president or not, we better make it clear to the Saudis that we're going to support you, we're in relation with you just like we were in the first Gulf War, but you've got to knock off the funding and teaching of radical clerics who are the very people who try to destroy us and will turn around and destroy them.
0.0	0.332641842867	Next, we have to talk to our adversaries, and we have to make sure they understand the limits of our patience.
0.0	0.450964189307	Bush is totally in favor of Common Core.
0.0	0.414846022821	And in the Holy Land Foundation trial in 2006 in Texas, they had a memorandum, an explanatory memorandum that talked about the fact that Americans would be easy to overcome and to commit civilization jihad because they were going to be trying to protect the rights of the very people who were trying to subvert them.
0.0	0.272484907813	We need to come together as a country because we have to realize that America is great, not from the top-down.
0.0	0.419241067625	There's only a promise to pay by the next generation, and the next generation's not big enough to pay it.
0.0	0.491136045755	I...
0.0	0.262521080838	And it's an honor to have everybody here.
0.0	0.470250877609	... and to devote the resources from the booming economy to rebuilding our Navy, rebuilding our Air Force, rebuilding our Army and ensuring we have the capacity to keep this country safe.
0.0	0.429534181325	Big government favors the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected, and crushes the small and the powerless.
0.0	0.431010626738	Let's take the money that we would give to Planned Parenthood and put it in women's health care without having to harvest the organs of the unborn.
0.0	0.46745362934	People have worked their entire lives.
0.0	0.285614872207	And we can get a lot of them out if we get the government out of our lives.
0.0	0.329081341455	I know personally how extraordinary and unique this nation is.
0.0	0.449028248049	We overcame the NRA's objections.
0.0	0.374590731261	Well, I was pleased that NATO announced just this week that they're going to start doing patrols in the Mediterranean, in the Aegean, to try to interdict the smugglers, to try to prevent the kind of tragedies that we have seen all too often, also to try to prevent more refugees from coming to the European Union.
0.0	0.501769755064	... first of all...
0.0	0.380381280426	I believe calling it what it is, is to say radical jihadis.
0.0	0.436506620961	I think it's fair to say that Baltimore is not now one of the safest cities in America, but the issue is...
0.0	0.240863925411	And, they've insinuated themselves into everything.
0.0	0.329981568529	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.444012567889	You wrote a book where you changed your position from a path of citizenship to a path of legalization.
0.0	0.334913277386	And the fact is that we need a commander-in- chief who not only understands how to protect us, but feels in here what it means to face the possibility of loss.
0.0	0.470742618193	I changed it in New Jersey.
0.0	0.213255764703	I don't want it.
0.0	0.35303385743	They would like to rip it up and start all over again, throw our nation back into this really contentious debate that we've had about health care for quite some time now.
0.0	0.416537309248	We need to arm the Kurds the directly.
0.0	0.5	That's not true.
0.0	0.37242732517	It didn't have the votes to pass.
0.0	0.637146594692	And it was even reported incorrectly yesterday, because they said, "He had assets of $9 billion."
0.0	0.222156826615	We need to reverse that.
0.0	0.336163804889	But this is nothing new.
0.0	0.378902291788	The facts are are very, very simple.
0.0	0.32030173459	I still want to get back to health care, because I think that's a worthy topic to explore.
0.0	0.443952186755	Leading by fixing the things that are broken.
0.0	0.315536340187	So, your original question is the right question.
0.0	0.307839045619	I've faced it.
0.0	0.175939806666	Yeah.
0.0	0.330407063976	But their leaders are much smarter than our leaders, and we can't sustain ourself with that.
0.0	0.389525993725	We need a unifier, not a cynical divider in chief, and that's exactly what I will do.
0.0	0.39369543251	... his answer -- you name it.
0.0	0.380807538575	That's exactly what I'll do as president of the United States.
0.0	0.451026104358	The time to turn the page is now.
0.0	0.376520019912	But let's not -- but let's not -- let's not insult -- let's not insult the intelligence of the American people.
0.0	0.366693034344	So, yes, I do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white Americans -- particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have -- you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is.
0.0	0.267683709589	And then, most importantly, here at home, I think there are three things that we have to get right.
0.0	0.602004350727	...One more time, in Ohio, our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.0	But you know what?
0.0	0.48276997626	That is principally an American-led air campaign that we are now engaged in.
0.0	0.458439647187	He's missing the whole point, that America's leadership in the world is required for peace and stability.
0.0	0.465939425169	If you look at the numbers, there are actually as many, if not more white communities that are truly being left behind and left out.
0.0	0.443193078723	Tonight we have a different debate than the debates that we have been allowed to have so far, because tonight is different because of this reason, that in the course of this presidential campaign America has again been attacked by jihadi terrorists, American lives taken from us.
0.0	0.468817706209	I had to answer every single question about every single result and every single projection in public until there were no more questions.
0.0	0.32177724788	I want to tackle those barriers that stand in the way of too many Americans right now.
0.0	0.297756553275	And -- and I guess I can -- can frame it another way.
0.0	0.334562520684	Trust has been totally lost in a lot of places.
0.0	0.316962487175	We have a stock market that, frankly, has been good to me, but I still hate to see what's happening.
0.0	0.374702532158	They come from another country and they're immediately sent out.
0.0	0.439419540027	Our government belongs to all of us, and not just the hand full of billionaires.
0.0	0.504150356182	And if I misrepresented those results or those projections in any way, I was held criminally liable.

0.0	0.441852898534	If i were the president of the United States, I would go and look at every executive order that exists right now and determine which ones want to be voided, because the president shouldn't be legislating: not through that vehicle or any other.
0.0	0.528422725486	What I said, and let me repeat it, I don't know what economists Secretary Clinton is talking to, but what I have said, and let me repeat it, that yes, the middle -- the family right in the middle of the economy would pay $500 dollars more in taxes, and get a reduction in their healthcare costs of $5,000 dollars.
0.0	0.471538555783	I started the Gang of Seven, and it led to the overtaking of the 40-year Democratic rule of Congress, because I didn't -- I stood up to the old-boy network in Washington, D.C. because I believed that Washington was not the solution, that Washington was the problem, just like Ronald Reagan said.

0.0	0.420234127998	I plead that it's very difficult when you deal with ISIS and organizations like that whose behavior is so barbaric and so vicious that it doesn't seem to have any purpose other than lust for killing and power and that's very difficult to put ourselves in the other shoe.
0.0	0.503894390558	I have fully endorsed those.

0.0	0.396739788469	And, this is what I am finding throughout America.
0.0	0.41353308066	It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are.
0.0	0.596302843504	Results count, and as governor, I pushed Florida up to the top in terms of jobs, income and small business growth.
0.0	0.411193325475	We did our own rallies.
0.0	0.566809595604	Let me just say, if you're talking about an $18 trillion economy, you're talking about a 15 percent tax on your gross domestic product.
0.0	0.362261722764	David, look, this is the big -- I agree, by the way, that we should have paid family leave.
0.0	0.311204844508	You know, I think most people know exactly what New York values are.
0.0	0.23064994069	They're going to build in Mexico.

0.0	0.370215225829	And he allows states to go ahead and do whatever they want on a substance that's illegal.

0.0	0.448626165108	If we want to create jobs for the folks that you're talking about, who are having trouble getting off government benefits, primarily because of their low skill level, there is no better way -- it's worked for 100 years in America -- putting people back to work in manufacturing is it.
0.0	0.163235567179	They can have it anyway you want.
0.0	0.233744599143	They're not sending you.
0.0	0.584350730569	I stood yesterday with 75 construction workers.
0.0	0.406548550979	As president I will restore and rebuild our military, restore the alliances and keep us safe.
0.0	0.522464225824	I would like the federal government to offer $10 billion over ten years to work with states, and I really applaud Governor Hassan for taking up this challenge and working with the legislature here to come up with a plan.

0.0	0.0	It was against Assad.
0.0	0.307565676121	Well, I'm just not sure I agree completely with that assessment.
0.0	0.418586061214	With Saudi Arabia and oil production, first of all, it's so critical for us to be energy independent, and we're getting there because of fracking and we ought to explore because, see, energy independence gives us leverage and flexibility, and secondly, if you want to bring jobs back to the United States of America in industry, low prices make the difference.
0.0	0.382772772619	They know we will be committed to victory.
0.0	0.35936811506	Without China, North Korea doesn't even eat.
0.0	0.354279068165	(inaudible), the great majority of Republicans and Americans believe in a hopeful future.
0.0	0.452560784504	I would repeal and replace the big lie, Obamacare.
0.0	0.357275731574	And that's why I've been clear, when I am the president of the United States of America, we don't know who you are, and we don't know why you're trying to come to the United States, you are not going to get in, because the radical threat that we now face from ISIS is extraordinary and unprecedented...
0.0	0.203575874656	You can have him.
0.0	0.328857201736	He doesn't understand the threat in ISIS.
0.0	0.396204547044	Can you have Medicare or Social Security?
0.0	0.32751667186	Because I think frankly, maybe I'm wrong, but on our worst day, I think we have a lot more to offer the American people than the right wing's extremists.
0.0	0.508049641251	The reason that I -- I hate them so much is because every single regulation costs in terms of goods and services.
0.0	0.414302295443	I am all in favor of keeping these talented people here so they can go to work in Silicon Valley.
0.0	0.234601460917	I want to take off from that point and argue the same thing.
0.0	0.38360831325	I did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild.
1.0	0.705714945147	Fourthly, I work -- look forward to working with Secretary Clinton for an investigation, an independent investigation, about all of the breaches that have occurred from day one in this campaign, because I am not convinced that information from our campaign may not have ended up in her campaign.
0.0	0.304654578177	If you want someone to grab a beer with, I may not be that guy.
0.0	0.465203419355	Now you and I and many of the people in this audience, if we get a $100 fine, we can survive it.
0.0	0.469673212416	And the reason is, is that I've been a reformer all of my career, fighting to reform welfare, fighting to reform the Pentagon, also being in a position to balance the budget, because that is very, very hard to do.
0.0	0.271491102975	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.445857037092	He was on the board.
0.0	0.462124565765	A military island.

0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.531374400298	Yeah, again, as I said, we're raising a family in the 21st century and it's one of the reasons why my tax plan is a pro- family tax plan.
0.0	0.474154794268	Here's my promise, at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country.
0.0	0.301699407976	We're dying.
0.0	0.350779904273	I just want to remind you, people paid their money.
0.0	0.326886517116	We actually did it.
0.0	0.53306885422	We can save and preserve and strengthen Social Security by making no changes for seniors, but for younger workers gradually increasing the retirement age, changing the rate of growth so that it matches inflation, and critically allowing younger workers to keep a portion of our tax payments in a personal account that we own, we control them, we can pass on to our kids.
0.0	0.436299238511	We cannot afford four more years of on the job training.
0.0	0.302525174559	They worked hard to provide us the chance at a better life.
0.0	0.185222724917	See, here's the thing.
0.0	0.304086595133	And they don't talk jobs and they don't talk China.
0.0	0.295428787256	But you haven't asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought I'd get that off my chest if you don't mind.
0.0	0.445902698291	If I'm our nominee, I will unite this party and we'll defeat Hillary Clinton and we will turn this country around once and for all, after seven years of the disaster that is Barack Obama.
0.0	0.351778495634	We were proud of them on graduation day, weren't we, Katie?
0.0	0.466895077468	I want to speak to all the moms and dads whose sons and daughters are fighting for this country, and the incredible sense of betrayal when you have a commander-in-chief who will not even speak the name of our enemy, radical Islamic terrorism, when you have a commander-in- chief who sends $150 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, who's responsible for murdering hundreds of our servicemen and women.
0.0	0.281732816458	And if we do those things, we can be a country that actually can afford debt-free college again.
0.0	0.452800896357	And, we have a government and leaders in government that are completely out of touch, and that's why I'm running for president.
0.0	0.217325363064	They don't know how to bring it about.
0.0	0.447548479791	Mark my words.
0.0	0.457669924158	I think the United States military is operating under rules of engagement that are too strict...
0.0	0.259837185322	I know we have a president who wants to do whatever he wants to do, and take his pen and his phone and just tell everybody what he thinks is best.
0.0	0.467954553525	But the differences among us pale compared to what's happening on the Republican side.
0.0	0.397201842815	Because you realize that people depending on you.
0.0	0.39322236714	And as our party's nominee, I will defeat Hillary Clinton in November.
0.0	0.48727414108	And it's probably not going to happen until we have real campaign finance reform and get rid of all these superpacs, and the power of the insurance companies and the drug companies.
0.0	0.464794311923	And I propose a block grant program that will keep the states in the game as well.
1.0	0.807757485753	And in Libya, for example, the United States, Secretary Clinton, as secretary of state, working with some other countries, did get rid of a terrible dictator named Gadhafi.
0.0	0.410325895302	But -- but we are going to end the absurdity, as Warren Buffet often remind us.
0.0	0.339897606398	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
1.0	0.530641798306	In 1988, I lost an election because I said we should not have assault weapons on the streets of America.

0.0	0.218233960796	You've got to have a clear vision of where you want to go.
0.0	0.272164486387	And by the way, I'm not even saying that in a -- that's the kind of mindset, that's the kind of thinking you need for this country.
0.0	0.267612212679	You really can't.
0.0	0.429812364591	But I think a pause on Syrian refugees has been exactly right for all the governors that have called for it, and also, of course, for me as the governor of Ohio.

0.0	0.510448660652	They are refusing to...
0.0	0.367048350072	I think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether it's poison in the water of the children of Flint, or whether it's the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the LGBT community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, that's what I want to take on.
0.0	0.438499339966	And this big powerful, corrupt bureaucracy works now only for the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected.
0.0	0.588036279909	The truth is that sentencing for blacks is higher than for whites.

0.0	0.407383116295	Germany, many other countries do it already.
0.0	0.368141375945	The fact of the matter is -- and let's say it in our debate, because you'll never hear this from that immigration-bashing carnival barker, Donald Trump, the truth of the matter is...
0.0	0.505614112388	If you place bad bets, the taxpayers bail you out.
0.0	0.505200023649	We own a home four blocks away from the place that I grew up in.
0.0	0.0	No, they shouldn't.

0.0	0.400409494535	And I'll note that California senator -- Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said, if she could say to Mr. America and Mrs. America, "give me your guns, I'm rounding them up," she would.
0.0	0.398220207235	It's an important one that we should be engaged in.

0.0	0.279543958949	Let me respond...
0.0	0.391478486229	We have to offer a compelling alternative that is based on hope and optimism and grounded in serious policy, which I've laid out.
0.0	0.407213870032	And at least if we enact these laws in a prospective way, we can address a major vulnerability in our country.
0.0	0.41807640305	And nobody, nobody on either one of these stages has done more than I've done and the people of the State of Texas to deal with securing that border.
0.0	0.38866267371	It was an excruciating experience.
0.0	0.328338946607	Where did that spirit come from in America?
0.0	0.455894562282	I think it would be better the more -- the less abortions we have, so the more states that we have that made abortion illegal, the better, as far as trying to save and preserve lives.
0.0	0.369264687991	It's not constitutional.
0.0	0.368802538068	Well, thank you very much for hosting this debate, and let me applaud my colleagues up here.
0.0	0.545878522563	Reduce our $18 trillion in debt, because, believe me, we're in a bubble.
1.0	0.375110415837	We get a no-good traitor, and they get the five people that they wanted for years, and those people are now back on the battlefield trying to kill us.
0.0	0.440838198464	I think they made the Second Amendment the second amendment because they thought it was just that important.
0.0	0.356866310067	And who's compromised and who is principled.
0.0	0.235011168265	I know the good ones.
0.0	0.413216493234	And now many of these candidates want to cut it.
0.0	0.363584726489	You know, for the 45-year-old construction worker out there, who is having a hard time making things meet.
0.0	0.314292433397	I want a government so small I can barely see it.
0.0	0.327942934284	So there's a lot of balanced interests.
0.0	0.577220642738	I have a proven record of success, 32 years in business, and 8 years as Governor of the state of Florida.
0.0	0.347299119776	It certainly does cover it.
0.0	0.379906900715	I looked at the intelligence.
0.0	0.336322630685	Then I looked at Rubio.
0.0	0.502029891609	And here's an area where Secretary Clinton and I believe we have a difference.
0.0	0.219782653745	I'm prepared.
0.0	0.459278510317	He might be on one of my courses.
0.0	0.372424191951	We need different solutions to solve the problems and to save our nation.
0.0	0.236434091776	Those are your enemies.
0.0	0.359044469568	If they don't treat us fairly, hey, their whole trade is tariffed.

0.0	0.577667258494	I sell apartments for -- I just sold an apartment for $15 million to somebody from China.
0.0	0.423042345218	In fact, in the last debate, very shamefully, she tried to hide her cozy relationship with Wall Street big banks by invoking the attacks of 9/11.
0.0	0.378813919675	Guaranteeing that women's work finally gets the pay, the equal pay that we deserve.
1.0	0.845028203146	Gun people said, there were three candidates in the race, you vote for one of the others, but not Bernie Sanders.
0.0	0.495969934554	And I traveled the country and learned how people made jobs.
0.0	0.443921215352	But I believe coming from a state that has virtually no gun control, I believe that I am in position to reach out to the 60 or 70 percent of the American people who agree with us on those issues.
0.0	0.367419250233	It's the only way you fix Medicare, the only way you fix Social Security.
0.0	0.421779531741	Secondly, I certainly support that we need to tear down cyber walls, not on a mass basis, but on a targeted basis.
0.0	0.318310394131	Our president doesn't have a clue.
0.0	0.441283384894	When I am president of the United States of America, there will never be any cap-and-trade in the United States.
0.0	0.32799914625	But you've just asked a very fundamental question about the role of faith in our country.
0.0	0.282382626415	Makes it a whole lot easier for them to want to go somewhere else.
0.0	0.433548014027	You're going to get it by paying your employees less and charging your customers more, that is a tax, the difference is, you don't see it on the bill.
0.0	0.47698526502	And I agree with Senator Sanders on that.
0.0	0.419272674958	And in my view, what we need to do is put together broad coalitions to understand that we're not going to have a political vacuum filled by terrorists, that, in fact, we are going to move steadily -- and maybe slowly -- toward democratic societies, in terms of Assad, a terrible dictator.
0.0	0.293011739139	You know, I see a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist.
0.0	0.427391824406	I was one of the original sponsors of the DREAM Act.
1.0	0.193289158248	It's not theirs anymore.
0.0	0.469972309062	So a large accounting firm and my accountants have been working for months, because it's big and complex, and they've put together a statement, a financial statement, just a summary.
0.0	0.395828441158	I'll advertise my Web site as well.
0.0	0.541874811623	Of course we have to raise the minimum wage.
0.0	0.367216734653	You know, you had Herbert Hoover before that saying, no, we got to only worry about the deficit.
0.0	0.480994398338	And that's why I've come forward with, for example, a plan to revitalize coal country, the coalfield communities that have been so hard hit by the changing economy, by the reduction in the use of coal.
0.0	0.538246389163	... we have the tools in federal law to do this now.
0.0	0.404997056212	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.378332105001	When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best.
0.0	0.500245941791	In all due respect, Secretary Clinton, a lot of the progressive groups, the online groups have really asked you a simple question.
0.0	0.327042574005	Freedom is personal for me, and I will always keep my word and fight for freedom.
0.0	0.527963015692	Look, the Second Amendment is not an option.
0.0	0.0	No.
0.0	0.496604664502	And it's because of the flip-flopping, political approach of Washington that both of my two colleagues on this stage have represented there for the last forty years.
0.0	0.494432888006	I've told people that from the time I was U.S. attorney 13 years ago.
0.0	0.412477719915	And it is a -- the kind of criticism that we've heard from Senator Sanders about our president I expect from Republicans.
0.0	0.312078621087	He's very charming.
0.0	0.509371353928	I would just say, I debated then Senator Obama numerous times on stages like this, and he was the recipient of the largest number of Wall Street donations of anybody running on the Democratic side ever.
0.0	0.302429237801	This is our time and our opportunity to do that.
0.0	0.233744599143	They're not sending you.
0.0	0.39942888895	We are not the world's policeman, but we need to stand up and be ready.
0.0	0.252193611399	I don't like that.
1.0	0.881718183213	You used to support legalizing people that were here illegally, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.334171943368	And I think that's a bad idea for the following reason.
0.0	0.390699704992	The head of Ford will call me back, I would say within an hour after I told them the bad news.
0.0	0.303776783614	Dynamically.
0.0	0.379195727251	We need to get back in the game as it relates to our Arab nations.
0.0	0.42898273934	We are at the threshold of a new era of American progress, but it's going to require that we act as Americans, based on our principles, here at home, making an economy that works for all of us.
0.0	0.344726161395	We need to invest more in terms of the other sort of visas and the other sort of waivers.
0.0	0.451478686219	Nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with.
0.0	0.39612125812	Well, to start with, unlike President Obama, I'll actually name the enemy that we confront.
0.0	0.549287446943	They issue two-thirds of the credit cards and one-third of the mortgages.
0.0	0.356809768064	May I respond to the critique on the ...
0.0	0.361658235532	And we've got to do more on equal pay for equal work.
0.0	0.391743710938	Today I heard it.
0.0	0.433525735393	... and we will end the illegal immigration.
0.0	0.0	Yes.
0.0	0.261815872977	We've gotten off the Hillary's e-mails, good.
0.0	0.339555389917	You know, before it was called Obamacare, it was called Hillarycare.
0.0	0.476549145494	We both agree that we have to get unaccountable money out of our political system and that we have to do much more to ensure that Wall Street never wrecks main street again.
0.0	0.379703569619	I actually have a plan.
0.0	0.476491747524	It was a big insurance company, AIG.
0.0	0.286682671366	All of us believe climate change is real.

0.0	0.380659022696	We are trying to bring America together around an agenda that works for working families and the middle class.
0.0	0.579056968691	Even if it was a one percent chance, and it's far greater than one percent because (inaudible).
0.0	0.398693170018	I would give up some Social Security to save a system that Americans are going to depend on now and in the future.

0.0	0.0	So what do we do?
0.0	0.419980939218	We have a strategy and a commitment to go after ISIS, which is a danger to us as well as the region... SANDERS (?
0.0	0.33754352059	It is not a suggestion.
0.0	0.408045561412	In Houston, Texas, there's an organization in place because someone acted on their heart, wanted to make sure that there's no homeless veterans in Houston.
0.0	0.440758387886	And secondly, when you talk about me being on the board of Lehman Brothers, I wasn't on the board of Lehman Brothers.
0.0	0.387680282523	I believe we should be appointing Supreme Court justices who will follow the law and not try to make the law.
0.0	0.336151926672	There is a pretty excruciating process that refugees go through.
0.0	0.194897689032	Yeah, he said everybody.

0.0	0.445200030527	Chris, the most important determination any voter is going to make in this election is who's best prepared to be Commander in Chief.
0.0	0.317948808449	We can build the fence.
0.0	0.403953699008	How about talking about the substantive issues the people care about?
0.0	0.383015575837	I would begin by saying that I'm not sure it's a weakness, but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for America's future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people.
0.0	0.446442319952	Our country is in crisis.
0.0	0.580067253258	And, unlike my two distinguished colleagues on this stage, I actually made college more affordable and was the only state that went four years in a row without a penny's increase to college tuition.
0.0	0.518191680158	We didn't win that war just from the air, we won that war by assembling a group of Arab leaders who stood in the Rose Garden and stood with America.
0.0	0.342940285389	That is beyond unspeakable.
0.0	0.273812573041	You don't have to say that.
0.0	0.291989857961	It's what they call it.
1.0	0.84292551286	It is the biggest job-killer in this country.

0.0	0.476414612758	The fact of the matter is, the more our people earn, the more money they spend, and the more our whole economy grows.
0.0	0.414924620064	So you don't get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.350213184754	And I ask everyone in America to call Congress tomorrow and say enough is enough; no more debt.

0.0	0.225733003421	They're laughing at us, at our stupidity.
0.0	0.402128861552	What we ought to do is tighten up our efforts to deal with the entry visa program so that a citizen from Europe, it's harder if they've been traveling to Syria or traveling to these other places where there is Islamic terrorism, make it harder -- make the screening take place.

0.0	0.25204577141	Let me say on that...
0.0	0.489307974074	For example, all right, who in America denies that we have an infrastructure that is crumbling?
0.0	0.376046563484	And you look around, and you see what's happening, and this is not the case when he introduced the doctor -- very nice, everything perfect but that is not representative of what you have in that line of migration.
0.0	0.470374870764	That will create a true 50-state national marketplace which will drive down the cost of low-cost, catastrophic health insurance.
0.0	0.491208384751	According to the economists -- who I'm not big believers in, but, nevertheless, this is what they're saying -- that $24 trillion -- we're very close -- that's the point of no return.
0.0	0.496130355185	And what I hear is people's concern that the economy we have is a rigged economy.

0.0	0.437399795705	But I would say that if you want to defend the country, it begins with border security.
0.0	0.497089473783	But in 2015, we have a very different economy.
0.0	0.33479695114	And we got to fight like crazy so people can think the American dream still exists, because it does, with rising wages, with full employment and with everybody in America -- and I mean everybody in America -- having an opportunity to realize the American dream of having a better life than their mother and their father.
1.0	0.517930407132	But just think about this-- since we last debated in Las Vegas, nearly 3,000 people have been killed by guns.
0.0	0.327950857518	The issue is -- I believe, and I believe this honestly, and I don't know that there's much difference on guns between us.

0.0	0.624904611632	We raised the minimum wage.
0.0	0.452345218119	One of the problems we have had -- I think all Americans understand this, is whether it's Republican administrations or Democratic administrations, we have seen Wall Street and Goldman Sachs dominate administrations.

0.0	0.439395843461	And having been in New Hampshire and here in Iowa, but in New Hampshire, I just received the support of seven out of eight of the newspapers in that state because they see positive, they see unity, they see coming together, and they see a record of change and a record of accomplishment.
0.0	0.411062486457	I brought people together over some very deep racial divides.
0.0	0.369262160148	That's a dictatorship.

0.0	0.392371310921	We must insist on assimilation -- immigration without assimilation is an invasion.
0.0	0.214578752573	It did not come from our Judeo-Christian roots, I can tell you that.
0.0	0.211838543095	You find me...
0.0	0.375086727879	I think you do have a humanitarian tragedy there, as I mentioned a moment ago.
0.0	0.429497268068	It would just -- you absolutely have to get involved with China, they are taking so much of what we have in terms of jobs in terms of money.
0.0	0.273627666762	But you know what we did in Maryland?
0.0	0.550186128012	No hour is too short, no dollar too small.
0.0	0.146701055129	It can happen.
0.0	0.510140220108	But unlike either of these two fine people, I've actually balanced a budget every single year.
0.0	0.423880734637	I know how important it is that we have a Democrat succeed President Obama in the White House.
0.0	0.270366223979	You know, I know to a lot of people in the media, this is just a great big game, and we're the players.
0.0	0.36903253365	I'm using my own money.
0.0	0.457964534165	But we can do is defund Planned Parenthood, and by the way, put in place an absolute permanent ban on any taxpayer dollars ever being used to fund abortions.
0.0	0.321985748416	I said right from the beginning that we should take no Syrian refugees of any kind.
0.0	0.353673403727	There's no way he launches 11 attack --
0.0	0.512615009136	And, indeed, my tax plan that I've introduced, it's available on our website.
0.0	0.400221910965	I think what we need is a commander in chief who is focused like a laser on keeping this country safe and on defeating radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.485497231872	And that's what we have= representing us.
0.0	0.202496845773	...before I go.
0.0	0.402351225751	Then you have to get rid of Larry Kudlow, who sits on your panel, who's a great guy, who came out the other day and said, I love Trump's tax plan.
1.0	0.908510586505	I vetoed a statewide I.D. system for gun owners and I pardoned, six out-of-state folks who came through our state and were arrested for owning a gun legally in another state so they never have to face charges.
0.0	0.428237406403	Yes, this one falls under the category of, I have actually done this.
0.0	0.238348689106	And that's why we're in the trouble that we're in now.
0.0	0.266606766926	There have been some good recommendations about what needs to happen.
0.0	0.427332067765	What we need to do is lead an international coalition which includes very significantly the Muslim nations in that region who are going to have to fight and defend their way of life.
0.0	0.406526027607	I will stop Iran from getting nuclear weapons.
0.0	0.554401142676	I was the first person out of the box that opposed him on it.
0.0	0.210268593958	They're not wrong.
0.0	0.43750086429	I was not that candidate.
0.0	0.435442229876	What we are talking about in reality is a corrupt campaign finance system, that's what we're talking about.
0.0	0.401351388389	Well, I believe, and I know that if Iowa helps make me the Republican nominee, I will defeat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.353783524172	But I look at this country today, and I look at how divided we are, I look at how politicians are always posturing and issuing sound bites but never solving problems.
0.0	0.344343822602	The answer is that all of the Mexicans, they're criminals and rapists, we've got to hate the Mexicans.
0.0	0.426901205641	Three specific reforms that reflect those principles.
0.0	0.278852621645	Afghanistan is a mess.
0.0	0.448933883634	When we do business with China, they tax us.
0.0	0.310461721862	I just wish he wouldn't misrepresent mine.
0.0	0.428462188543	But I also understand, when a law enforcement official charged with the responsibility of preventing attacks -- to go back to our early questions, how do we prevent attacks -- well, if we can't know what someone is planning, we are going to have to rely on the neighbor or, you know, the member of the mosque or the teacher, somebody to see something.
0.0	0.44081692047	Second of all, and the reason I believe in a health care for all program, we need to understand that addiction is a disease, not a criminal activity.
0.0	0.363654763915	We need somebody ready to be commander-in-chief on day one, who understands there are no moderates in Iran, they've been killed a long time ago.
0.0	0.279322345683	He was a great negotiator.
0.0	0.0	I do.
0.0	0.420607317078	He was overthrown by British and American interests because he threatened oil interests of the British.
0.0	0.569659938615	It was a company that had grown into a bloated, inept bureaucracy that cost too much and delivered too little to customers and shareholders.
0.0	0.377365074117	And I believe that Puerto Rico ought to have the right of self-determination.
0.0	0.300435652688	And you can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.246584785112	Nobody.
0.0	0.260437809266	This is the only time I've had a chance, let me finish.
0.0	0.427619894709	Maybe we should focus on quality education with well-paid faculty members.
0.0	0.489597920169	All without any government mandates whatsoever through the marketplace.
0.0	0.411444643112	So let's set the facts straight.
0.0	0.179566291602	It's good to be with you.
0.0	0.307199171117	But, we can't rest.
0.0	0.414123274652	None of that information was looked at.
0.0	0.396375181061	The president wants to do things without working with his Congress, without working with the legislature, and without getting the consent of the American people.
0.0	0.415880626995	By the way, no nation on earth is more generous than America is.
0.0	0.405877065352	So what if children are going hungry?
0.0	0.143493513073	I'll talk to them.
0.0	0.457133585799	Social Security, which Republicans call a Ponzi scheme, may face privatization.
0.0	0.378349632356	It sounds crass.
0.0	0.43039370865	I think we have a disagreement, and the disagreement is that not only did I vote against the war in Iraq.
0.0	0.385026123452	Well, one of us ran against Barack Obama.
0.0	0.453901224979	And Turkey, by the way, did a very decent thing, providing what was reasonable housing and conditions for those people.
0.0	0.516836250898	When you have six financial institutions in this country that issue two-thirds of the credit cards and one-third of the mortgages, when three out of four of them are larger today than when we bailed them out because they are too big to fail, we've got to re- establish Glass-Steagall, we have got to break the large financial institutions up.
0.0	0.494993583186	Number two, I want Medicare to be able to negotiate for lower drug prices just like they negotiate with other countries' health systems.
0.0	0.390056170949	You'll see me on the floor of the Senate tomorrow filibustering this and saying enough is enough, no more debt.
0.0	0.344172840569	This is a humanitarian catastrophe.
0.0	0.217205718426	Oh.
0.0	0.563031117673	And when you led the charge with the Gang of Eight, I supported it because you asked me to.
0.0	0.478506559292	Where did it ever say in the Constitution, where is it written that it's the job of the United States of America or its secretary of State to determine when dictators have to go?
0.0	0.422533449371	But I agree, as I mentioned a moment ago, with King Abdullah.
0.0	0.468473470568	But Jeb is also right that, if we just impose a tariff, they'll put reciprocal tariffs, which will hurt Iowa farmers and South Carolina producers and 20 percent of the American jobs that depend on exports.
1.0	0.893508149773	The cost of college education is escalating a lot faster than the cost of inflation.
0.0	0.305498172408	But wait, I just want to say this Senator.
0.0	0.372506676248	I learned so much just sitting at his feet playing with blocks listening to him negotiate with subcontractors.
0.0	0.45759527894	This president -- and, by the way, Secretary Clinton, who called Assad a reformer -- she called Assad a reformer.
0.0	0.467911321484	We have to act in a much more whole of government approach, as General Dempsey said.
0.0	0.455493590485	Paul Krugman, the Nobel Prize winning economist, who said my plan for what we should do to reign in Wall Street was more comprehensive and better.
0.0	0.480688145733	You save it by making the United States, by making us rich again, by taking back all of the money that's being lost.
0.0	0.422356572383	She was naturalized.
0.0	0.279012183595	I know the bad ones.
0.0	0.352271566595	So the reporter said to me the other day, "But, Mr. Trump, you're not a nice person.
0.0	0.320491973636	We have to find out -- many people knew about what was going on.
0.0	0.653115591613	Here is the story -- it's not just the college graduates should be $50,000 or $100,000 in debt.
0.0	0.496732235826	We've cut taxes, balanced budgets, changed the regulatory environment.
0.0	0.432972366748	You did support a U.N. Security Council approach, which we did follow up on.
0.0	0.386261651765	Now, I recognize that the vast majority of people coming in here probably are not those kinds of people, but that's not good enough.
0.0	0.255517365467	I don't think Ted can have it both ways.
1.0	0.697571354996	This president is undermining our military.
0.0	0.456747373211	Why not go to Congress and in a bipartisan way, begin to deal with the process of mental health issues so that people that are spiraling out of control because of mental health challenges don't have access to guns.
0.0	0.312986224655	She wants to pursue the American dream.
0.0	0.531165165478	You're looking at the -- at the man who introduced and fought on the floor as a freshman senator and passed the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 over two President Clinton vetoes.
0.0	0.382920680041	And we do have to form a coalition.
0.0	0.173464960935	You're certainly not very good.
0.0	0.619224982521	Could we loan you $4 billion"?
0.0	0.0	Thank you all very much.
0.0	0.371690843852	I believe we stand together to address the real issues facing this country, not allow them to divide us by race or where we come from.
0.0	0.368533125676	So -- because we got to make the country rich.
0.0	0.192740678664	We have to find out what's going on.
0.0	0.28774070999	Let me just -- just say this.
0.0	0.455577143005	And we just got to make sure that every American has the tools, in K-through-12 and in vocational education, in higher education.
0.0	0.446777031164	Super PACs are a disaster.
0.0	0.265431707401	I'm going to be independent.
1.0	0.892120597599	Number one, States have been dis-investing in higher education.
0.0	0.504224681228	That's the record of accomplishment that should be taken to Hillary Clinton, who has no record of accomplishment.
0.0	0.402241099369	So the answer is no and what Jeb said is absolutely correct.
0.0	0.344643043885	Now, secondly, let me say I'm a maniac and everyone on this stage is stupid, fat, and ugly.
0.0	0.305931906714	We have to stop, and it has to stop now.
0.0	0.300395891139	I've got the backbone, I've got the band width, I've got the experience to get us through this.
0.0	0.219101647079	Here's what I believe.
0.0	0.479143943618	I respectfully disagree with Senator Sander's approach.
0.0	0.412793970214	Well first of all, the idea that somehow we're better off today than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated president of the United States is totally an alternative universe.
0.0	0.249829918411	Let me just...
0.0	0.316117379023	I try to live by the rules, no matter what they are, and I was brought up that way as a kid.
0.0	0.456392140003	And the people who are getting hammered are small businesses, it's single moms, it's Hispanics.
0.0	0.319469629696	Neil...
0.0	0.260909770297	Come on now.
0.0	0.373435024069	They don't care about American workers, they just care about bringing as many people in so they can get as many votes as they can.
0.0	0.474317160707	There is a radical jihadist group that is manipulating our immigration system.
0.0	0.409427931864	And sending that signal makes it impossible for us to be serious about taking out ISIS and restoring democracy in Syria.
0.0	0.267211884358	If they can't regulate themselves, then the NFL needs to look at just, you know, moving away from them a little bit.
0.0	0.429297681605	And what you'll find is that I led -- helped lead the effort as a member of the House financial committee against Alan Greenspan, against a guy named Bill Clinton, maybe you know him, maybe you don't.
0.0	0.522174703082	And its bankruptcy and its failure nearly destroyed us.
0.0	0.510735303369	We lost thousands of lives, thousands in Iraq.
0.0	0.453412302678	This is an incredibly complicated region of the world.
0.0	0.414670576683	We had Iran putting operatives in South America and Central America.
0.0	0.329002064795	This is a war for the soul of Islam.
0.0	0.334298328626	Because I think we have to get to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.494249670049	In the 1980s, it was in Beirut, Lebanon, under President Reagan's administration, and 258 Americans, marines, embassy personnel, and others were murdered.
0.0	0.253740186847	You know, I like Marco.
0.0	0.464883492167	But people have to be alert.
0.0	0.42610649697	And if you go to my Web site, berniesanders.com, what you find is not only going to help lead the opposition to that war, but much of what I feared would happen when I spoke on the floor of the House, in fact, did happen in terms of the instability that occurred.

0.0	0.0	I didn't.
0.0	0.175939806666	Yeah.
1.0	0.814479328655	They are going to people showing videos of Donald Trump insulting Islam and Muslims in order to recruit more radical jihadists.

0.0	0.0	OK.
0.0	0.467263807014	I strongly support the president's executive actions.
0.0	0.454656434521	Now, the whole region has been rendered unstable, in part because of the aftermath of the Arab Spring, in part because of the very effective outreach and propagandizing that ISIS and other terrorist groups do.
0.0	0.254320415435	You can change your mind.
0.0	0.552938282105	And that's what we have to contrast.
0.0	0.283648023522	It won't happen.
0.0	0.56098891125	You once had a pension.
0.0	0.425305743264	The immediate -- it is not Assad who is attacking the United States.
0.0	0.342076904521	Look, we have to stop with political correctness.
0.0	0.215669367676	We're not going to dismantle everything.
0.0	0.26313118929	But let me say one more thing.
0.0	0.388814598278	Kathie, this was not merely theory in Maryland.
0.0	0.436721535479	So conservatives actually do come out of Manhattan, including William F. Buckley and others, just so you understand.
0.0	0.262667386317	Excuse me.
0.0	0.436332929672	Can I share this quick story?
0.0	0.476424632412	I'm putting up 100 percent of my own money.
0.0	0.399497837569	Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.218884456587	And, thank you everybody.
0.0	0.450770494041	You see, all of my career, I've fought about giving voice to the people that I grew up with and voice to the people that elected me.
0.0	0.160890580596	I happen to think...
0.0	0.36657432787	And you've seen a little bit of this emerging in the -- in the African Union and the things that they have done to better stabilize Somalia.
0.0	0.473922180643	That's wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country.
0.0	0.243733222933	You don't want to hear the answer.
0.0	0.547890983021	Because we work with the private sector to make solar energy affordable and available to businesses and individuals in our state.
0.0	0.369130202056	The fact is that there was a great effort made by the Obama administration and others to really send a clear message, because we knew that so many of these children were being abused, being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border.
0.0	0.432396010025	We need major, major reforms of a very broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.32120252357	People that know me, like me.
0.0	0.175939806666	Yeah.
0.0	0.244101342237	What I've always said is that this issue does need to be solved.
0.0	0.291203062678	Look, I think we are readier than we used to be, but it's a constant effort that has to be undertaken to make sure we are as ready as we need to be.
0.0	0.526671180633	A rich person does not.
1.0	0.332763284419	It isn't there anymore, Mike.
0.0	0.390182915234	And we need to do that throughout the country.
0.0	0.482973912339	You know, just two weeks ago was the 25th anniversary of the first Persian Gulf war.
0.0	0.325826419255	That's because we've put conservative policies in place.
0.0	0.203134673493	They're very concerned about it.
0.0	0.452181933969	That's the side we need to be on, and that's the side of the bulk of the -- of the Middle East.
0.0	0.314654040689	You see, we usually elect presidents in America that want to change the things that are wrong in America.
1.0	0.832846561445	I'm very proud that I support legislation that is currently in the Congress, got support of almost all progressive Democrats in the House and Senate, which says we will end the absurdity of women today making 79 cents on the dollar compared to men.
0.0	0.3865652894	It only makes common sense.
0.0	0.304286305402	I have no idea.
0.0	0.404660975095	Well, I would begin by reminding people that at this point in previous presidential elections, Jimmy Carter couldn't win, Ronald Reagan couldn't win, Bill Clinton couldn't win, and neither could've Barack Obama.
0.0	0.459911685421	And then in addition to that, the American people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.361035098723	You know, we have to stop this because, you know, if we manage to damage ourselves, and we lose the next election, and a progressive gets in there and they get two or three Supreme Court picks, this nation is over as we know it.
0.0	0.369128005748	That, I think, between the two of us demonstrates the strength of the support we have among people who want to see change in our country.
0.0	0.39266031988	Martha, if I may...
0.0	0.473783971687	Yes, they have to stop trying to destabilize the Middle East, causing even more chaos.
0.0	0.410132689678	And I would hope in the midst of all of this discussion, this country makes certain that we do not turn our backs on the men and women who put their lives on the line to defend us, and that we stand with them as they have stood with us.
0.0	0.406770540878	It doesn't do anybody any good if terrorists can move toward encrypted communication that no law enforcement agency can break into before or after.
0.0	0.309500229162	We had Hamas.
0.0	0.323872784246	Well, look, I believe that we've made great progress as a country with the Affordable Care Act.
0.0	0.42075670929	Martha, religious liberty doesn't include encouraging a fellow American to engage in violent jihad and kill an American here.
0.0	0.493776761653	Well, again, I mean, obviously, as already has been pointed out, the only budget that Ted has ever voted for is a budget that Rand Paul sponsored that brags about cutting defense spending.
0.0	0.424384150674	Do we still have values and principles?
0.0	0.346110526596	This is incredibly complicated, because we've got Iran as a big player, in addition to Russia.
0.0	0.346549596475	It's the evil government that is -- that is putting all these regulations on us so that we can't survive.
0.0	0.603334318355	Women are not charged more than men any longer for our health insurance.
0.0	0.229808733239	No, I love them.
0.0	0.355824175362	The fact is, there's a number of things that the next president is going to have to do to clean up this mess.
0.0	0.178517977603	Alright.
0.0	0.302007638272	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.410569144996	We don't need Hillary Clinton's price controls for -- again, does anybody out there think that giving Washington, D.C., the opportunity to run the pharmaceutical industry is a good idea, given how well they have done running the government?
0.0	0.419817495558	Let me tell you that, in this country -- in this country, people are concerned about their economic future.
0.0	0.564371990573	It's a simple flat tax for everyone.
0.0	0.385610034967	It's not for them to make those decisions about whether or not something is legal or illegal, or profiling or not.
0.0	0.571287050827	That's what I said to my own public health people.
0.0	0.260570369979	You take a look at the -- at Belgium.
0.0	0.324517679093	You know, we all have our own individual interpretations of our faith.
0.0	0.315361253958	But the final thing I want to say about this is the following.
0.0	0.481696181479	We got a U.N. Security council vote.
0.0	0.310089305384	Somebody said, "Oh, that's crass."
0.0	0.402605183277	... replacing dependency with opportunity.
0.0	0.388995775647	And I put forth an immigration policy that is as strong in favor of the folks who are struggling in America the most than anybody else.
0.0	0.374761206893	It was designed with Iowa's own Congressman Steve King and Jeff Sessions, and...
0.0	0.179566291602	Not good.
0.0	0.0	...
0.0	0.420841481924	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.308858100073	Well, I mean, I was talked about in the question.
0.0	0.523901445265	I tried (ph), early in my marriage, explaining to my wife why someone named Sallie Mae was taking $1,000 out of our bank account every month.
0.0	0.478296369205	The fact is, in order to get this economy moving again, I call for freezing regulations for a year except for the problem of public safety.
0.0	0.337879844228	And the fact is it was wrong.
0.0	0.306668728639	So there are people watching tonight in business.
0.0	0.473004099705	Absolutely, they should fight to fund -- defund Planned Parenthood, and I don't think the president should shut down the government simply to send our taxpayer dollars to this group.
0.0	0.492427173531	We have people that are morally corrupt.
0.0	0.446045795863	Every one of us is gifted by God, whether it is those poor babies being picked over or it's someone whose life is tangled up in a web of dependence.
0.0	0.296886750041	We have a -- they say there's no bipartisanship in Washington?
0.0	0.469898086449	That is what I could do for the country.
0.0	0.271050334394	Let's calm down a little bit, Martin.
0.0	0.360826233938	They will never again support it, and that's wrong for our country, bad for our future.
0.0	0.140590294129	So be very, very careful.
0.0	0.503819707165	I believe if the amendments I introduced were adopted, that the bill would pass.
0.0	0.301021673013	Yes, exactly, exactly.
0.0	0.574257840382	And every single income decile sees a double-digit increase in after-tax income.
0.0	0.495362076303	Community- based businesses and farms are getting crushed.
0.0	0.22811286818	We did a lot to help.
0.0	0.456595816938	We need to make the government run smarter and better, and reform this corporate tax system, bring that money back to the United States to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, and we need to use it also to protect our grid from terrorists.
0.0	0.40924055532	Let's create an America that works for all of us, not the handful on top.
0.0	0.402514523083	If you do that, you don't just change the economy, you transform the lives of millions of hurting Americans.
0.0	0.613184485278	Low income people who are not involved in the political process.
0.0	0.427149625024	He said, "we have the military in the streets right now.
0.0	0.529789194607	Here is where we are with public education.
0.0	0.368908885091	They went to the vendor and said, "hey, something is wrong," and that was quietly dealt with.
0.0	0.388614480155	I mean, all of us support funding Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.500882934688	When he meets with the attorney general in the White House, it's not "how can we protect the Second Amendment rights of Americans."
0.0	0.491237525008	And it bothers me very much that, rather than working on this issue to resolve it, it has become many press releases from the Clinton campaign later.
0.0	0.486320313466	I don't think you expand entitlements when so many people are dependent on government and when the money the federal government is offering is going to be taken away from you after just a couple of years.
0.0	0.378720845625	The U.S. has become a dumping ground for everybody else's problems.
0.0	0.451954954236	And it has been a remarkable situation in our state.
0.0	0.36885930685	If we're going to have a coalition, we're going to have to have a coalition not just of people in the western part of the world, our European allies, but we need the Saudis, we need the Egyptians, we need the Jordanians, we need the Gulf states.
0.0	0.442419580727	Somebody who, yes, votes right, but much more than that, leads the efforts to protect the hard-fought gains that women have made, that, make no mistake about it, are under tremendous attack, not just by the Republican presidential candidates but by a whole national effort to try to set back women's rights.
0.0	0.0	It was...
0.0	0.434402921072	But I've also said for the most part, these issues would be left back to the states.
0.0	0.368722971084	We need a strategy to destroy ISIS there.
0.0	0.520480094263	When you have three out of the four largest financial institutions in this country bigger today than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have six financial institutions having assets equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of America, while issuing two-thirds of the credit cards and a third of the mortgages, look, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, that great trust-buster would have said break them up.
1.0	0.493470819672	Well, we have an authorization to use military force against terrorists.
0.0	0.409229895186	Because what she will do is come in and she will raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.358819744075	I'm very proud that NARAL endorsed me because when it comes to it we need a leader on women's issues.

0.0	0.435130477567	We cannot fix things in this country -- the Social Security, the border, balancing the budget, getting wages to grow faster -- unless we lead as conservatives, but we also invite people in from the other party.
0.0	0.205515374504	Well, I would really appreciate that.
0.0	0.523099157599	And I can do it without raising the debt, without raising taxes on the middle class and making it reasonably manageable within our budget so that we can be fiscally responsible at the same time.

0.0	0.489812914449	In the same light, as the foreign leader, Winston Churchill's politics were not my politics.
0.0	0.364182127855	Well, first, the most important job of being president is obviously to keep our country safe and to keep the families of America safe.
0.0	0.510357196842	We now have some good models about how better to provide employment, housing and education.
0.0	0.0	May I respond?
0.0	0.204422926017	How stupid are they?
0.0	0.59210499758	We are spending $80 billion a year locking up our fellow Americans.
0.0	0.294411856264	We can do that in Washington.

0.0	0.30460152108	That is a pledge that I'm making.

0.0	0.350270408759	That is not what America is supposed to be about.
0.0	0.431007872478	I also think the war on drugs has disproportionately affected our African-American community, and what we need to do is make sure that the war on drugs is equal protection under the law and that we don't unfairly incarcerate another generation of young African-American males.

0.0	0.505660093333	CLINTON: Judy, I think that the best analysis that I've seen based on Senator Sanders plans is that it would probably increase the size of the federal government by about 40%, but what is most concerning to me is that in looking at the plans -- let's take healthcare for example.

0.0	0.29315256685	David...
0.0	0.363872156942	Why didn't they call the police?

0.0	0.466758981927	And I'm going to tell you this, we need to use the benefit of our law enforcement people across this country, combined with our intelligence people across this country.
1.0	0.807607523657	One, Senator Sanders voted in 1998 on what I think is fair to call a regime change resolution with respect to Iraq, calling for the end of Saddam Hussein's regime.

0.0	0.487310236157	It will provide three months paid family and medical leave for the working families of this country.
0.0	0.411914254447	And yes, when I am president of the United States, if there is some place in this country where radical jihadists are planning to attack the United States, we will go after them wherever they are, and if we capture them alive, they are going to Guantanamo.
0.0	0.375529363866	And, the fact is, none of them.
0.0	0.448790002946	And for my part, I have demonstrated the ability to have the backbone to take on Wall Street in ways that Secretary Clinton never, ever has.
0.0	0.450953709238	Part of the problem that we have currently in the Middle East is that Assad has hung on to power with the very strong support of Russia and Iran and with the proxy of Hezbollah being there basically fighting his battles.
0.0	0.455099000195	Hey, I'm in the United States Senate, and anyone who doesn't think that there is an enormous amount of waste and inefficiency and bureaucracy throughout government would be very, very mistaken.
0.0	0.354102676828	We will see what the American people are willing to support.
0.0	0.533259240141	Barack Obama right now, number one, over seven years, has dramatically degraded our military.
0.0	0.300769852611	I believe that we need to focus on destroying ISIL.
0.0	0.369590968563	(inaudible).
0.0	0.317597624271	It's not a bestseller.
0.0	0.343467581658	I was mentioned in the question.
0.0	0.420004916405	I want to use pell grants to help defray the living expenses that often make a difference, whether a young person can stay in school or not.
0.0	0.368519964868	Let me just add one thing about ISIS over there.
0.0	0.622138458728	You know, the annual Medicare budget is over $600 billion.
0.0	0.427656280654	Yeah.  TRUMP R 15 75 0 N So I finally got it over there and they charged me a big tariff.  TRUMP R 15 75 1 N They're not supposed to be doing that.  TRUMP R 15 75 2 N I told them.
0.0	0.246547116649	Everybody is really doing some bad fact...
0.0	0.261194149505	John, do you want me to answer or do you want to answer?
0.0	0.178257717474	That's what they're doing.
0.0	0.373339005182	It's not that complicated actually.
0.0	0.369462217507	Yes, they control them.
0.0	0.285643395242	You know, I think my biggest weakness is exactly the opposite.
0.0	0.469118361961	It is Hillary, it is Biden, it is the others who insist on allowing abortion well into viable (inaudible) wrong, and that should be stopped.
0.0	0.356653047591	And Megyn, it's best not to talk anymore about back doors and encryption, it will get solved, but it needs to be solved in the situation of the White House with the technology folks.
0.0	0.453850065191	The Cold War is over.
0.0	0.385526496192	Well, let me first describe Iran because they're not just a normal nation state.
0.0	0.321545777444	They have no choice.
0.0	0.539459803854	The big corporations have the scale to deal with all of this.
0.0	0.433235485229	Planned Parenthood had better hope that Hillary Clinton wins this election, because I guarantee under President Jindal, January 2017, the Department of Justice and the IRS and everybody else that we can send from the federal government will be going in to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.348856169298	They didn't save enough money for us to go to school.
0.0	0.30145465673	Martha, we offered a lot more than they were willing to take.
0.0	0.253605010611	I want security.
0.0	0.339103390626	You know, I have said -- I have said many times, you know, I'm not asking people to support me because I'm a woman.
0.0	0.360913087424	I said, "Is he intelligent?"
0.0	0.471758557622	The New York Times a few weeks back had a columnist who wrote a column saying, "Anybody But Cruz."
0.0	0.545325859963	And there is only one person on this stage who voted to take away authority from the SEC and the Commodities Future Trading Commission that they could no longer regulate what are called swaps and derivatives, which actually contributed to the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and that was Senator Sanders.
0.0	0.47614115338	I congratulate Secretary of State John Kerry and the president for working on this agreement.
0.0	0.542418859471	Today in America we have more people in jail than any other country on earth, 2.2 million people.
0.0	0.291469955256	And it's got to stop and it's got to stop fast.
0.0	0.290128041112	Because a lot of people said, "He'll never run.
0.0	0.193009884947	I was down there, and I've never seen anything like it.
0.0	0.449198660677	Parents, and sons, and daughters and family members, and as our hearts go out to them and as our prayers go out to them, we must remember this, that this isn't the new face of conflict and warfare, not in the 20th century but the new face of conflict and warfare in the 21st century.
0.0	0.211085105632	You want one?
0.0	0.491675167262	On September 11, my wife was two blocks from the World Trade Center.
0.0	0.334962508677	(LAUGHTER) And he got nasty.
0.0	0.454150654907	He's in favor of Common Core.
0.0	0.346082770022	Neil, the problem...
0.0	0.315915135536	And number two, if we find out they're developing a nuclear weapon and we know how to get to it, we're gonna go take it out.
0.0	0.271612971861	I've laid out...
0.0	0.43549490408	You had only 21 Republican governors in this country.
0.0	0.376378037456	So when somebody like Donald Trump and others...
0.0	0.345447243437	And if people want a more high-minded politics and want to move our country forward, go on to martinomalley.com and help my campaign move our country forward.
0.0	0.0	Yes.
0.0	0.229808733239	I love the Saudis.
1.0	0.847559544317	But as you've indicated for millions of American workers, people in New Hampshire -- all over America, they're working longer hours for lower wages deeply worried about their kids.
0.0	0.234164072504	Yes, I might feel more comfortable.
0.0	0.176108149569	They don't know what they're doing.
0.0	0.311464981523	I'm totally open to a tariff.
0.0	0.377355818058	There is no challenge too great for the United States to confront, provided we have the ability and the courage to put forward new leadership that can move us to those better and safer and more prosperous days.
0.0	0.453607808019	The contrast with the Democratic debate, where every fawning question from the media was, "Which of you is more handsome and why?"
0.0	0.368232550435	(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
0.0	0.0	OK?
0.0	0.344891407079	We are rebuilding China.
0.0	0.293596673493	So I believe as president I will look very carefully about unintended consequences.
0.0	0.533817446122	I led the effort, unfortunately unsuccessfully, against deregulation because I knew when you merge large insurance companies and investment banks and commercial banks it was not going to be good.
0.0	0.499420211659	The issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24 months ago.
0.0	0.348772757682	Those three things put together are going to give confidence to job creators and you will begin to see wages rise.
0.0	0.388255841849	But Saudi Arabia is in big, big trouble.
0.0	0.366514165693	I'm asking people to support me because I think I'm the most qualified, experienced, and ready person to be the president and the commander- in-chief.
0.0	0.244929948966	That's what I'm working towards.
0.0	0.367211412624	I am a conservative because I know our values, our principles and our policies --
0.0	0.425841139268	And, you know the old inscription, if you save one life, you've changed the world.
0.0	0.253939158727	I know the Democrats have the ultimate SuperPac.
1.0	0.866752828971	When that war began, we had 529 ships.
0.0	0.416814471484	It is disgraceful, and in a Christie administration, they would know much, much better than to do that.
0.0	0.286105984646	If that's not hypocrisy, I don't know what hypocrisy is.
0.0	0.0	And why?
0.0	0.449739442323	They discussed how -- how hard it is to sell tractors in China, because all the regulatory barriers.
0.0	0.357808786773	In my view, it doesn't go anywhere near far enough.
0.0	0.405576949052	Let's reverse the immunity.
0.0	0.370563084356	It's the New York Times, they are always wrong.
0.0	0.253397081838	You know, let me say something at the outset.
0.0	0.289180015947	... hillaryclinton.com, and read about it.
0.0	0.406298524115	We need someone to fight for the people.
0.0	0.352680966884	They recognize that people's actions don't always match their words.
0.0	0.360863050285	And if you listen to what they say -- and I had a chance over those 11 hours to watch and listen, as well as what I see in their debates -- they are putting forth alarming plans.
0.0	0.385673814003	But I want to start by helping those people who are most at risk, the ones who, yes, are cutting their pills in half, who don't believe they can make the rent, who are worried about what comes next for them.
0.0	0.343839142939	They are not our friend, believe me.
0.0	0.465613829498	The isolationist is the one who wants to continue to follow a foreign policy that has fewer democracies today than when Barack Obama came into office around the world.
0.0	0.438205477648	Well, first of all, let's understand why we are even having this debate and why Donald tapped in to some of that anger that's out there about this whole issue.
0.0	0.213651126405	It's going in and that's going to be it, going into Tennessee.
0.0	0.153429175132	Oh, I'll talk about that, too.
0.0	0.314708207551	They've advertised that.
0.0	0.47821804589	And I would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country.
0.0	0.392162294794	That is like shouting "fire" in a crowded theater, and that is illegal, and I would do everything in our power not just to go after those who are here who we know who are here, before they can radicalize other Americans to carry out attacks, and it's not just the ones they've arrested.
0.0	0.466924042479	I was responsible for the convention center on the west side.
0.0	0.398374822174	But this cannot be an American fight, although American leadership is essential.
0.0	0.277282425473	We will do very, very well, very, very well.
0.0	0.599477905588	I released 34 years of tax returns...
0.0	0.483426793982	They've contacted the trafficking networks in the Western Hemisphere to get people in through the southern border.
0.0	0.307715837282	When you're a governor, you're held accountable for everything you do.
0.0	0.419138549454	But the first task is to bring countries together to destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.351939114656	And if we capture any of these ISIS killers alive, they are going to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we're going to find out everything they know, because when I'm president, unlike Barack Obama, we will keep this country safe.
0.0	0.295025431569	And, you know, I don't know all the details of what Rick Snyder has done.
0.0	0.504323952332	Now you are a worker, white worker, black worker, who had a decent job, that manufacturing job is gone.
0.0	0.654738854654	$5 billion Web site.
0.0	0.421916927853	We have so much natural gas now, and we can liquify it, and we can transfer it across the sea so we can make Europe dependent on us instead of Putin -- put him back in his little box where he belongs.
0.0	0.436426208098	You know, I've supported legislation to allow body cameras.
0.0	0.411692985317	And hopefully -- you know, Senator Graham, I -- I know where he's going to be on this, but we use Congress, and we use Congress to cut this funding.
0.0	0.471234626882	He is not the only one.
0.0	0.483514837772	And I stood alongside Jeff Sessions and Steve King, and we led the fight against amnesty.
0.0	0.268484342601	I don't want immigration reform to fail.
0.0	0.521448031005	Number two, this was the man that was a managing general partner at Lehman Brothers when it went down the tubes and almost took every one of us with it, including Ben and myself, because I was there and I watched what happened.
0.0	0.409449635159	She'd be a great president of the United States because the leadership she brought to H.P.
0.0	0.363280791219	And here's the problem in this country right now.
0.0	0.571604411714	And one of the reasons in some states why the percentage cost has gone up so much is because governors there would not extend Medicaid.
0.0	0.419380087902	this is a clear and present danger in our politics within.
0.0	0.602504518268	Nine months ago, our campaign began.
0.0	0.34935196853	And I ask you to join me in truth and honesty and integrity.
0.0	0.396833761855	We do have to take a hard look at the defense budget and we do have to figure out how we get ready to fight the adversaries of the future, not the past.
0.0	0.336370348556	Look, we need more Americans to be involved in the political process.
0.0	0.327655986138	That's not the America that I've ever known.
0.0	0.446949130184	Do senators have the right to disagree with the president?
0.0	0.486420713356	I voted yes to suspend that.
0.0	0.353769097185	And what I have said is I will not throw us further into debt.
0.0	0.342688415457	Well, obviously, you don't understand my views on homosexuality.
0.0	0.292374116696	So don't put people in there if you don't want them bombed.
0.0	0.209222587351	But here's the point I want to make tonight.
0.0	0.372700874416	My father used to say, "Johnny, we never -- we don't hate the rich.
0.0	0.338198117918	I was the architect.
0.0	0.359609168066	But they all said, a lot of the pundits on television, "Well, Donald will never run, and one of the main reasons is he's private and he's probably not as successful as everybody thinks."
0.0	0.542388522297	It's called the value added tax.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.349262252716	Which is what we're gonna get if we elect a big government liberal like Hillary Clinton to the White House.
0.0	0.613813217944	We're reducing taxes to 15 percent.
0.0	0.22904927423	We want to build on it and fix it.
0.0	0.370237670194	And not only did I fight them, but I beat them.
0.0	0.455011979747	Here is the major issue when we talk about Wall Street.
0.0	0.415077920237	Who do you know will defend life, marriage and religious liberty?
0.0	0.553013881967	I also am very committed to getting the price of drugs down.
0.0	0.450433590355	And I believe that one of the big failings in that region is a lack of human intelligence.
0.0	0.532983231243	His first election and his re-election.
0.0	0.318844204179	So, there does need to be a whole of government approach, but just because we're involved and we have a strategy doesn't mean we're going to be able to dictate the outcome.
0.0	0.42456594362	And that's what I'll offer to the people of the United States in this candidacy for the presidency.
0.0	0.194844593624	Do you know where I'm going, Kevin?
0.0	0.187182054967	You know, the situation is this.
0.0	0.0	Yes.
0.0	0.489096225072	We ought to be helping in terms of the technology for fracking, keeping the price low, quite frankly, because that's what's keeping him contained.
0.0	0.253408698806	I mean, you know, let's not be naive about it.
0.0	0.588256260202	The billionaire and the working man, no hedge fund manager pays less than his secretary.
0.0	0.403742774946	We should be relying upon the leadership of the Congress to pass the laws.
0.0	0.663800871038	On top of that, there is a business flat tax of 16 percent.
0.0	0.440102250317	So listen, this is the difference between being a governor and a senator.
0.0	0.229443501051	We'll just clean it up.
0.0	0.485568479551	We've been the most pro-life state six years in a row.
0.0	0.600484970673	And I used it to pay off my loans.
0.0	0.390476586057	It's kind of basic.
1.0	0.802313014164	A vat is imposed as a sales tax when you buy a good.
0.0	0.290634238047	All of that together, we're going to be just fine and America is going to continue to lead the world.
0.0	0.547684905363	But if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things, including corporate taxes, and including the capital gains taxes, you make that amount up pretty quickly.
0.0	0.539851745949	We just, earlier this week, kicked them out of Medicaid in Louisiana as well, canceled their provider contract.
0.0	0.419184733998	If we reengage and get involved, yeah, we can have health care for all people, we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.681483588291	You have families out there paying 6 percent, 8 percent, 10 percent on student debt, refinance their homes at 3 percent.
0.0	0.266846926595	Let's hope that it holds.
0.0	0.570591660429	Second of all what we do, is you raise the minimum wage to living wage, 15 bucks an hour over the next several years.
0.0	0.403019223397	The nature of warfare has changed.
0.0	0.0	And...
0.0	0.333269643398	We should be supportive of that effort.
0.0	0.359316817667	So with that invocation, let me say a few words.
1.0	0.785247931973	Our military is a disaster.
0.0	0.262283474465	That's a blessing.
0.0	0.494670217338	Now, this takes, David, 18 months to 24 months, two years.
0.0	0.364856000865	If it had gone right, believe me, she would have been running around to be able to take credit for it.
0.0	0.31468066087	If somebody put me on their homepage, they did it without my permission.
0.0	0.313083981378	So under President Trump, here's what would happen:
0.0	0.396804532922	We the Muslims should lead the effort on the ground."
0.0	0.319052919275	And believe me, you look at the border with Yemen.
0.0	0.207553782655	Well, I've been --
0.0	0.444343883909	Starting with our children and moving forward.
0.0	0.545765928464	And universities.
0.0	0.319708037775	And the answer is: Because they know I will go right after them, that I will not let their agenda be America's agenda.
0.0	0.395282735604	Have a no fly zone in Syria and create safe zones to deal with the refugees.
0.0	0.3763894344	Unintended consequences.
0.0	0.325763609213	You've got to work with local communities and you've got to work with the federal government.
0.0	0.446474821293	I laid out a plan at the Citadel to do just that and it starts with creating a "No Fly Zone" and "Safe Zones" to make sure refugees are there.
0.0	0.428625332629	First of all, yes, we've stolen.
0.0	0.259120672612	Why don't we let the process work.
0.0	0.422013403246	The American people are terrified.
0.0	0.353828380346	So Hillary and I have a difference.
0.0	0.373591047581	I said temporarily.
1.0	0.860772621488	They would repeal the Affordable Care Act, not improve it.
0.0	0.506265869396	This would be devastating for the economy.
0.0	0.538448410923	No criminal records for them.
0.0	0.27833223404	Well, let me -- let me first of all talk a little bit about my experience.
1.0	0.591739882291	$10.10 was all I could get the state to do by the time I left in my last year.
0.0	0.218826890208	It never happens.
0.0	0.303613127899	Let's have a Democratic Syria.
0.0	0.235873474613	Fine, I'll take it.
0.0	0.473317882451	And if I am president and we get our hands on him, he is standing trial for treason.
0.0	0.373938408154	But honestly, if you're a small business owner today you are being crushed.
0.0	0.276562435514	I'm going to get a response to that, Neil.
0.0	0.38393432027	We were attacked from Afghanistan.
0.0	0.284943930226	So I'm going to keep making that case.
0.0	0.321389600571	And it's important that people really look hard at what the threats and dangers we face are, and who is best prepared for dealing with them.
0.0	0.498094632129	It would not necessitate us raising any taxes.
0.0	0.421481761845	First what they saw in Paris, now what they have seen in San Bernardino.
0.0	0.329976057583	The mentally ill?
0.0	0.362793374953	He was kind of a conservative guy in many respects.
0.0	0.241372677121	Mr. President, we're not against you.
0.0	0.490135262214	It's why you see Walgreens buying Rite Aid.
0.0	0.378902291788	But the facts are simple.
0.0	0.424228985337	Give Bernie Sanders credit.
0.0	0.38149974355	You know, you go to the internet, you start reading an article and you go to the comments section -- you cannot go five comments down before people are calling each all manner of names.
0.0	0.355032240701	We have to repeal Obamacare, and it can be -- and -- and it can be replaced with something much better for everybody.
0.0	0.305043908634	The only way we're going to solve this problem is with we, the people.
0.0	0.445601111291	Because we have to stop doing things for some people, but for this country, it's destroying our country.
0.0	0.522225670392	But the United States is not the policeman of the world.
0.0	0.224674972908	I think I am a nice person.
0.0	0.454654496442	No, what I said, Chris, was that the law needs to be followed.
0.0	0.430655335784	At the end of the day, the legal issue is quite straightforward, but I would note that the birther theories that Donald has been relying on -- some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on U.S. soil, but have two parents born on U.S. soil.
0.0	0.426499852005	It was never intended that the government should be in every aspect of our lives.
0.0	0.394167793333	I used the tithing analogy.
0.0	0.407296004834	I agree, however, it doesn't go far enough, because what it focuses on are the big banks, which Senator Sanders has talked about a lot, for good reason.
0.0	0.388615107203	My four children have been able to receive a good Christian education, and I've been able to save for them to go to college so they never have to have the loans that I did.
0.0	0.423318290303	We were behind where we were today.
0.0	0.510636041315	And just like Social Security and unlike the Republicans, I think we should actually expand Social Security and increase average monthly benefits.
0.0	0.393334765203	And when you do that, when you're in a position of managing regulations; when you reduce taxes; and when you have fiscal discipline, you see the job creators begin to get very comfortable with the fact that they can invest.
0.0	0.239859008116	And they wanted to make sure it got built.
0.0	0.367095183625	Barack Obama wants America to be more like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.48946281282	And we have to take on ISIS online.
0.0	0.478862180423	And I give you my word, if I am elected president, no service man or service woman will be forced to be on their knees, and any nation that captures our fighting men will feel the full force and fury of the United States of America.
0.0	0.321980007222	... stirs up the demagoguery against American Muslims, that hurts us at home.
0.0	0.0	But you know what?
0.0	0.461920426591	And, you know, there are a number of programs that I think are duplicative and redundant and not producing the results that people deserve.
0.0	0.5	No, it's true.
0.0	0.487516770137	We have to invest in the local partnerships, and the best place to intervene, the best indicator of when a person is actually on the verge of killing themselves because of an addiction, is at the hospital.
0.0	0.574837450417	But out-of-pocket costs have gone up too much and prescription drug costs have gone through the roof.
0.0	0.231868380525	I'm too agreeable, easy going.
0.0	0.293847173483	You know, all of these politicians that I'm running against now -- it's so nice to say I'm running as opposed to if I run, if I run.
0.0	0.370941118239	Why don't we just give a chicken in every pot, while we're, you know, coming up -- coming up with these fantasy tax schemes.
0.0	0.345484735043	I was ready to lead, but I wasn't ready to run.
0.0	0.418977962274	When was the last time you heard China is killing us?
1.0	0.721323492568	Well, I would certainly build on the successes of the Affordable Care Act and work to fix some of the glitches that you just referenced.
0.0	0.337726115736	So, I think we've got to understand the complexity of the world that we are facing and no place is more so than in the Middle East.
0.0	0.38823288289	That's calling it what it is.
0.0	0.591587064623	And we fought for statewide school choice, where the dollars follow the child, instead of the child following the dollars.
0.0	0.464046314007	When I ran in Texas, I told the people of Texas, "if you elect me, I will lead the fight against amnesty."
0.0	0.292809538858	I say, yes, not only do we give them what they need, but we don't tie their hands behind their backs so that they can go ahead and get the job done.
0.0	0.276569797446	... What was your question...
0.0	0.197600728804	He'll say.
0.0	0.417489505881	My name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.506509378808	You find me a Democrat -- you find me a Democrat that will cut spending ten dollars?
0.0	0.3354311749	And I think when you give low-income kids -- African-American, white, Latino kids -- the opportunities to get their lives together, they are not going to end up in jail.
0.0	0.339897880085	Well, this goes to the question you were just asking.
0.0	0.386480223449	I have a friend who's a doctor, and he said to me the other day, "Donald, I never saw anything like it.
0.0	0.243030982695	But I think they will see a very good option here.
0.0	0.403652503256	I think there is constitutional and legal authority for the president to have done what he did.
0.0	0.501081791444	And it creates a -- a contempt for the law, for the rule of law.
0.0	0.369314365586	Let me do that but let me pick up on an issue, a very important issue that we have not yet discussed.
0.0	0.368520496968	We need people who think out of the box and can solve problems; can utilize the resources around them; very smart people, to focus on the problem and solve the problem.
0.0	0.544138722994	Simplifying the code and lowering rates, both for corporations and -- and personal rates, is exactly what we need to do.
0.0	0.471389943175	And as Reagan demonstrated, if we cut taxes, we can bring back growth.
0.0	0.576669420155	And, this year, in 2015, New Jersey's had the best year of job growth that our state has ever had in the last 15 years.
0.0	0.532063808502	The wages that high school graduates receive today are significantly less, whether you are white or black, than they used to be.
0.0	0.318994632418	They have children who are doing so well, I've met and worked with dreamers.
0.0	0.388592487283	I do, however, believe in Reagan's 11th commandment, and will not be engaging in awful things about my compatriots here.
0.0	0.530135484337	We will invest in education, and jobs for our kids, not incarceration and more jails.
0.0	0.0	Yes.
0.0	0.416127753435	Right there, right next to the plant.
0.0	0.371297057791	He's very upset.
0.0	0.49218156661	You know, we have a war on virtual everything -- race wars, gender wars, income wars, religious wars, age wars.
0.0	0.335636858852	But this is what you're seeing in the Republican debate that you didn't see in that Democrat debate.
0.0	0.16410375262	So I know it's not going to happen overnight and everything that can be done should be done.
0.0	0.461152125843	I will tell you, you could win a bet at a bar tonight, since we're talking about fantasy football, if you ask who the top three states in America are that produce solar energy: California and Arizona are easy, but number three is New Jersey.
0.0	0.284017287731	Most importantly, I think I understand leadership, which sometimes requires a tough call in a tough time.
0.0	0.285596978188	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.353281823443	Here, we actually need 1,000 because we have natural barriers.
0.0	0.387828572765	All these other people want to cut the hell out of it.
0.0	0.332542324452	You know, it is difficult finding intelligence that is actionable in a lot of these places, but we have to keep trying.
0.0	0.44521355788	Wall Street today has too much political power.
0.0	0.265657340451	You're not going to hear a lot of polished political speech from me, but you will hear the truth.
0.0	0.55088020011	But when we talk about Wall Street, you have Wall Street and major banks have paid $200 billion in fines since the great crash.
0.0	0.327756085788	And Carl -- Carl, I'm not finished yet.
0.0	0.271491102975	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.395877116924	We need to address our security issues, we need to address the economic issues around the kitchen table.
0.0	0.569207435255	Not all of his top national security advisors agreed with that.
0.0	0.484512185272	You know, we could give you another example -- the Marines, the Army, these wonderful six soldiers that were killed.
0.0	0.360115070867	So we have a disagreement on this.
0.0	0.367344312099	But we have a serious problem.
0.0	0.534671258619	If I become President because we'll have a Constitutional Amendment to require a federally balanced budget so they will do their job.
0.0	0.412912363611	I have fought my entire life to make sure that healthcare is a right for all people.
0.0	0.557399535508	The main problem with Medicare right now is that the average person pays in taxes over their whole lifetime about $100,000.
0.0	0.339510807676	But I guess the final thing that -- that I would say is this is the kind of debate we need to take to the Republicans in the fall.
0.0	0.488158905774	Well, the role has been defined by each person who's held it.
0.0	0.496541946243	The worker's out of a job.
0.0	0.495677974533	We should reimpose sanctions, they've already violated sanctions after this agreement was signed by testing medium-range missiles.
0.0	0.426215865158	Because so many people in my family worked in steel mills, and they didn't work with a white collar, they worked in a blue collar.
0.0	0.375527072634	And I'm very grateful to the brave Navy SEALs who carried out that mission.
0.0	0.415511609577	Let the states do this.
0.0	0.34128045188	Well, I don't know if it's a blind trust if Ivanka, Don and Eric run it.
0.0	0.48634784281	I suspect you may have.
0.0	0.327438064664	That's American capitalism.
0.0	0.365770159061	We need, and only the three of us will do this, nobody on the Republican side will even admit there's a problem.
0.0	0.410349231421	They would never be hired again.
0.0	0.298630328328	And here in Wisconsin, I want to reiterate: We've got to stand up for unions and working people who have done it before...
0.0	0.449616787743	I was not the secretary of state...
0.0	0.466416150166	Common Core should -- it is a disaster.
0.0	0.332277811911	I would a whole lot rather had Carly Fiorina over there doing our negotiation than John Kerry.
0.0	0.455914807249	I do not support amnesty...
0.0	0.238205151491	That's why I've got such a good plan.
0.0	0.479303730081	It was Countrywide Mortgage.
0.0	0.455312836871	The most mistreated people.
0.0	0.462934994744	And at the end of the day, it was the president's decision.
0.0	0.219936970732	No, I don't think so.
0.0	0.44180897793	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the free enterprise system.
0.0	0.372734240449	This is an emergency.
0.0	0.540461520974	There is no money in the Medicare account.
0.0	0.376216956758	That is why Hillary Clinton cannot win this election.
0.0	0.41769030736	... first of all, let me just tell you something -- and you know, because you just saw the numbers yourself -- NBC Wall Street Journal just came out with a poll -- headline: Trump way up, Cruz going down.
0.0	0.235636376164	We need somebody who can lead.
0.0	0.620961824415	... and 300,000 e-mails in my government record.
0.0	0.291378775213	And when I'm president, I can tell you this, my faith will not just influence the way I'll govern as president, it will influence the way I live my life.
0.0	0.217204348687	Well, you're talking about -- yeah.
0.0	0.435688379918	RADDATZ: OK. Let's go to talk about the high cost of college education and for that we turn to the executive director of the New Hampshire Institute of Politics, right here at Saint Anselm college, Neil Levesque.
0.0	0.442480880527	And not just green cards.
0.0	0.18696380666	And here's what's going to happen.
0.0	0.467208584014	This president has failed, and when I'm in the Oval Office, police officers will know that they will have the support of the president of the Untied States.
0.0	0.209117319515	You're right about that.
0.0	0.416413580701	That's just a fact, and that's what Donald Trump taps into.
0.0	0.378748448458	I've tried to be as specific to answer questions so that my proposals can be vetted, because I feel like we have to level with people for the very reason, Gwen, that you are mentioning.
0.0	0.44952573774	It's you see the health insurance companies getting together.
0.0	0.557791162587	Any connection maybe to the fact that our people pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs?
0.0	0.420074914437	You are working at McDonald's?
0.0	0.426627652593	Secondly, to go after and dismantle their global network of terrorism.
0.0	0.373853542456	They knew they were talking about the issues of attacking people, Megyn.
0.0	0.421516699785	We got into a bad habit of creating big bureaucracies, old methodologies, to undermine regimes that were not friendly to the United States.
0.0	0.364821918562	I want to do more to help incentivize and create more small businesses.
0.0	0.577865851177	The planes are older than the pilots.
0.0	0.377282937686	When you became president, you had a Democratic Congress and a filibuster-proof Democratic Senate.
0.0	0.485456035559	And after four or five years in Brooklyn, I ventured into Manhattan and did a lot of great deals -- the Grand Hyatt Hotel.
0.0	0.23418212551	That's all I'm saying.
0.0	0.420115495363	At the same time, law enforcement understands there are people in the community who not only think that the system doesn't work for them, but works against them.
0.0	0.249829918411	Let me just -- let me just...
0.0	0.410568173867	The first thing is we have to strengthen our alliances around the world.
0.0	1.0	I never said that.
0.0	0.279074970619	We're ready to start shooting."
0.0	0.316286299131	And, you know, take advantage of the tremendous opportunities in energy that God has given us, not get involved in these little petty arguments.
0.0	0.219936970732	So I don't think...
0.0	0.47185948287	And when he moved on his own people, threatening a massacre, genocide, the Europeans and the Arabs, our allies and partners, did ask for American help and we provided it.
0.0	0.369504645109	And this is why you need to send someone from outside of Washington to Washington.
0.0	0.242462868414	Well, thank you.
0.0	0.321666547393	I don't care.
0.0	0.301568413463	And when I look at Washington today, we need to bring us together.
0.0	0.445882461276	Neil, I was mentioned too.
0.0	0.406470252485	So what I say to those people who go to Donald Trump's rallies, understand: He thinks a low minimum wage in America is a good idea.
0.0	0.485645689686	So we have to rebuild our infrastructure, our bridges, our roadways, our airports.
0.0	0.561055486643	In the last 30 years, there has been a massive redistribution of wealth.
0.0	0.426406394743	If they hear people running for president who basically shortcut it to say we are somehow against Islam, that was one of the real contributions, despite all the other problems, that George W. Bush made after 9/11 when he basically said after going to a Mosque in Washington, we are not at war with Islam or Muslims.
0.0	0.465701027411	So, I represented New York, and I represented New York on 9/11 when we were attacked.
0.0	0.496749800959	We went after companies that were doing things that were against the law.
1.0	0.773419840176	That's wrong.
0.0	0.38596518078	You target the bad guys.
0.0	0.321932848267	Lots of people will say lots of different things about me in this campaign and others, but the one thing they've never said about me is that I'm misunderstood.
0.0	0.0	Both.
0.0	0.453486917811	It was the most highly sought after -- or one of them, but I think the most highly sought after project in the history of General Services.
0.0	0.462548904801	When I was in Washington, I fought to get the budget balanced.
0.0	0.277842230047	I would change them.
0.0	0.44519122782	Well, the answer is, obviously, if you see suspicious activity, you report it.
0.0	0.325949232795	Well, Senator, look, I think we're in vigorous agreement here.
0.0	0.347513932	And I was proud to stand with him and support it.
0.0	0.509764258408	And if at the end of 18 months, 24 months there are people who have been cleared, and I would prioritize widows, and orphans, and the elderly, people who may have relatives, families, or have nowhere else to go.
0.0	0.429242226317	But at the end of the day, Nancy, here is the question -- in this great country of ours, with so much intelligence and so much capability, why do we remain the only major country on earth that does not guarantee health care to all people as a right?
0.0	0.36067593934	I'm not using donors.
0.0	0.347574529879	I think there's a sense in this country today that somehow our best days are behind us.
0.0	0.540416021513	I voted for Dodd-Frank, got an important amendment in it.
0.0	0.477909779948	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, it is demonstrably true...
0.0	0.369371292216	My heart has not changed, because I've always been appalled by abortion.
0.0	0.478690637084	She wouldn't just be a disaster, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being commander in chief of the United States.
0.0	0.135868346405	They're great.
0.0	0.385871832631	One, work with the tough men, the dictators, for our own benefit and promote democracy.
1.0	0.887067904239	And I've done it when I was in Washington when we had a balanced budget; had four years of balanced budgets; paid down a half-trillion of debt.
0.0	0.470305438693	The United States, at the same time, cannot successfully fight Assad and ISIS.
0.0	0.541512859843	I believe if this amendment were to pass, the chances of this bill passing into law would increase dramatically.
0.0	0.41095284343	Maria, I assume that I can respond to that.
0.0	0.325972385186	We did as much as we could because the Libyans themselves had very strong feelings about what they wished to accept.
0.0	0.402808203189	There has never been a jihadist group like this.
1.0	0.695874478796	It looked like very few women.
0.0	0.0	No, not at all, absolutely not.
0.0	0.28568496637	We're going to end up in the same place.
0.0	0.230919794403	And who can blame them?
0.0	0.327468992533	So yeah, someone who makes more money...
0.0	0.290798296187	There is no other description of it.
0.0	0.245396120728	I said, "Very interesting."
0.0	0.429795596845	And I believe that we can springboard off of this new U.N. resolution, and we should create, as Secretary Clinton indicated, and I agree with that, that there should be a political process.
0.0	0.437729306828	You know, on my very first visit to New Hampshire in this campaign, I was in Keene, and I was asked what are you going to do about the heroin epidemic?
0.0	0.237658933637	And I think that's a mistake, and I just don't think Marco can have it both ways.
0.0	0.34397753151	And the fact is that that's not a democracy.
0.0	0.475914530702	Well, in fact, I would argue that the disastrous invasion of Iraq, something that I strongly opposed, has unraveled the region completely and led to the rise of al-Qaeda and to ISIS.
0.0	0.251461400001	He has got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.378130281708	I really put that on Assad and on the Iraqis and on the region itself.
0.0	0.378749138415	We need radical changes in mental health in America so somebody who is suicidal or homicidal can get the emergency care they need.
0.0	0.293642259972	Well, it's an interesting question because I'm very proud of my company.
0.0	0.414836919492	At that particular point in time, then Americans will believe that Washington is up to a conversation to deal with the millions of people that are here illegally, but not until.
0.0	0.40655992676	If they had guns, he wouldn't be around very long.
0.0	0.358734705038	You get, like, three days where you have to show up?
0.0	0.469701722414	... everybody nervous to get out of their cars if you're a law enforcement officer.
0.0	0.505665472591	We elected a president that is weakening America on the global stage.
0.0	0.162386309641	I'll do it.
1.0	0.81396833204	In those 38 words, it said anyone here illegally is permanently ineligible for citizenship.
0.0	0.290025159065	You want to fix Medicare?
0.0	0.309497304981	We need sound money.

0.0	0.25905181194	We're seeing it in my state and we'll see it in this country.
0.0	0.434680446054	But the fact is, every single engine of government has to move when you see a crisis like that.
0.0	0.33429225451	So, I think it's important for us to be careful about the language we use, which is why I've been critical of Donald Trump.
0.0	0.339321333168	He was a little teddy bear to me.
0.0	0.308411653293	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.

0.0	0.415203343942	I worry greatly that the rhetoric coming from the Republicans, particularly Donald Trump, is sending a message to Muslims here in the United States and literally around the world that there is a "clash of civilizations," that there is some kind of Western plot or even "war against Islam," which then I believe fans the flames of radicalization.
0.0	0.430464484569	None of these instances that the president points to as the reason why he's doing these things would have been preventive.
1.0	0.618535053946	We spent $2 trillion in Iraq, $2 trillion.

0.0	0.453791195502	This country is running out of time.
0.0	0.364713216408	Hopefully after the 2016 election, some of the Republicans will come to their senses and realize we are not going to deport 11 or 12 million people in this country.
0.0	0.413498250342	I want to end the international embarrassment of the United States of America being the only major country on earth that doesn't guarantee health care to all people as a right, not a privilege.
0.0	0.43620490758	I would like to start with a basic.

0.0	0.344148019587	And we are in a situation right now in our country that we have never been in before.
0.0	0.428794159006	And if you want to know who's telling the truth, you should look and ask people like Jeff Sessions and Steve King and Rush Limbaugh and Mark Levin, all of whom say, as Jeff Sessions said, responding to these false attacks just recently in Alabama -- he said, "if it wasn't for Ted Cruz, the Gang of Eight Rubio/Schumer bill would have passed.
0.0	0.375722358312	May I have a chance to respond to this issue?
0.0	0.571914477924	Number one, most important economic reality of today is that over the last 30 years, there has been a transfer of trillions of dollars from the middle class to the top one-tenth of one percent who are seeing a doubling of the percentage of wealth that they own.
0.0	0.377699285112	Folks, it's not too late.

0.0	0.419519457658	But the Democrats are going to bring a lawsuit, and you have to have certainty.
0.0	0.43046050999	I guess the one I -- I would pick is the fact that I was part of a very small group that had to advise the president about whether or not to go after Bin Laden.
0.0	0.495358967055	And not only did I win, but I then worked with a Democratic legislature to put in place the most sweeping conservative reforms of any state in America, taking us from the most dangerous state in America to the fourth safest; reducing our welfare rolls by over 1 million, and replacing over 700,000 private sector jobs.
0.0	0.190601508307	And we need to very, very concerned about that.
0.0	0.311785188417	And I'll go back to something that had been mentioned just a few minutes ago.
0.0	0.212912698678	I tell you that.
0.0	0.46467786367	It's why you see the banks consolidating.

0.0	0.444555815057	And my effort in introducing them was to find a solution that reflected common ground and that fixed the problem.
0.0	0.365319974413	I think Americans want someone to have a track record of showing them how to get this country back on record, someone who will stand up and every day project that best days of America are in front of us.

0.0	0.210360661745	Those are the kinds of things that we ought to be doing.
0.0	0.307480245071	Now, what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next.
0.0	0.38661697861	And people are saying, "What's going on?
0.0	0.35041748266	You know, we can't -- if we're not going to send American troops, which there was never any idea of doing that, then to try to send trainers, to try to send experts, is something we offered, Europeans offered, the U.N. offered, and there wasn't a lot of responsiveness at first.
0.0	0.34939399291	And we're going to just fix everything with waste, fraud, and abuse?

0.0	0.376290397439	So I put together this statement, and the only reason I'm telling you about it today is because we really do have to get going, because if we have another three or four years -- you know, we're at $8 trillion now.
0.0	0.194385705337	And I've been there.
0.0	0.416262011237	And they have a desire not simply to conquer the Middle East and to become the dominant power in that region, but ultimately to be able to hold America hostage.
0.0	0.184568299584	What he wants is something to get done.
0.0	0.432679173228	There's the establishment lane, the anti- establishment lane, and then there's the Kasich lane.
0.0	0.378023412157	Our best days are in front of us.
0.0	0.526972546579	What I would like for the media now is for us to be talking about why the middle class is disappearing, why we have more people in jail than any other country, why we have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, and we're the only major country on Earth without paid family and medical leave.
0.0	0.491453636872	You joined the Senate in voting to get rid of Gadhafi, and you asked that there be a Security Council validation of that with a resolution.
0.0	0.413389175952	(APPLAUSE) They're trying to prevent people from registering to vote.
0.0	0.322286926795	While there are lots of good ideas for reform, we have never tackled the basics.
0.0	0.160998278357	You know, maybe they're dumb and they don't know what they're going to get, but I don't think so.
0.0	0.205260077226	And that's what I intend to do.
0.0	0.449619264948	And I also have detailed plans to fix the mess in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.445358276917	Carl Icon today as you know endorsed.
0.0	0.394609327723	They want a political revolution in which millions of Americans stand up, come together, not let the Trumps of the world divide us, and say, you know what, in this great country, we need a government that represents all of us, not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.
0.0	0.423922620583	Now, the challenge we're seeing today is that the Supreme Court is being converted into some type of political body.
0.0	0.326886517116	... Actually, I was...
0.0	0.377871623726	They know that this country is not respected around the world anymore.
0.0	0.368415091471	I think it is fair to say, whatever the complaints that you want to make about him are, that with respect to China, one of the most challenging relationships we have, his opening up China and his ongoing relationships with the leaders of China is an incredibly useful relationship for the United States of America.
0.0	0.369240796216	I looked at ways that the shareholders would have more control over what was going on in that arena.
0.0	0.415666150578	My point is this.
0.0	0.367475295261	They can provide forces.

0.0	0.415664947849	I think it was a mistake to expand Medicaid everywhere in Ohio and across the country.
0.0	0.470997110328	I think, Secretary Clinton, $1.61 a week is a pretty good invest.
0.0	0.385727361572	There are loads of great ideas, great conservative ideas from wonderful think tanks about how to reform the tax code.
0.0	0.224062159047	But it could be he'd want to be cool, and he'll wait until the next day.
0.0	0.525327408465	In a previous Democratic debate, Martha Raddatz, three times, asked Hillary Clinton about the failure in Libya, a policy that she took credit for, and said, "what is your measure of responsibility, Madam Secretary, for the failure in Libya?"
0.0	0.428788944608	And this is where I've had my disagreement with Senator Rubio.
0.0	0.512551967109	Imagine a country where people are lifted out of poverty again.
0.0	0.368709592376	There are a lot of factors involved in that.
0.0	0.423454675055	If we had guns in California on the other side where the bullets went in the different direction, you wouldn't have 14 or 15 people dead right now.
0.0	0.174734542482	Well, I want to know, did you win?
0.0	0.209967244044	I totally get that.

0.0	0.487245469395	A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to go on a congressional delegation.
0.0	0.379929282776	And I thought it was horrible when it was broadcast on television, because boy, does that send signals to Putin and all of the other people that look at us and they say, "That is a group of people, and that is a nation that truly has no clue.

0.0	0.285233633259	They say, " well, we don't really have control."
0.0	0.516129625259	Because that person should not have gotten a gun, should not -- would not have passed a background check.
0.0	0.36776061915	Now, let me just be clear, John.
0.0	0.470909492335	They went to the DNC quietly.
0.0	0.247808836177	That's right.
0.0	0.423529254172	Well, there's no question that ISIS is a very serious problem, and I don't believe that this administration recognizes how serious it is.
0.0	0.386201538145	And they don't buy their guns from a gun store.
0.0	0.215128756912	I kind of miss him.
0.0	0.269798098326	And we are not England.
0.0	0.491136045755	And so do I.
0.0	0.247296167123	I think it's a two-pronged issue.
0.0	0.363655945125	He consistently underestimates it but I do not.
0.0	0.312009705631	You learn to constantly evaluate and understand the nature of the threats that you are being faced with.
0.0	0.654918572472	Yeah, but that -- because the math is, if you -- 5 percent of a million is a lot more than 5 percent of a thousand.
0.0	0.372315672528	That's the job.
0.0	0.369250814145	But here's the best way that we're going to make America much more exceptional: it is to make sure we put someone on that stage in September who will fight Hillary Clinton and make sure she never, ever gets in the White House again.
0.0	0.385672467396	Community has to understand that that police officer wants to get home at night, and not -- not to lose their life.
0.0	0.359241570207	Well, that just wasn't -- that just wasn't the fact, Senator.
0.0	0.347365233852	And we can take that message and that formula to Washington to lift every single American to a better life.
0.0	0.242388183619	Maybe we would've gotten a deal where we didn't give everything away.
0.0	0.447360678653	For over 200 years, America's light has been shining on the world and the world has never been the same again.
0.0	0.385191621454	They should be Muslim troops.
0.0	0.366730835501	And I'm delighted to be here in New Hampshire for this debate.
0.0	0.39334284025	A no-fly zone would prevent the outflow of refugees and give us a chance to have some safe spaces.
0.0	0.375616382895	As I said before, we are a land of immigrants, but we have to be intelligent about the way that we form our immigration policies, and that's one of the reasons that I have called on us to declare war on the Islamic State because we need to reorient our immigration policies and our visa policies for people who are coming into this country because there are many people out there who want to destroy us.
0.0	0.382025177443	So I believe that, in fact, this country needs to move towards a living wage.
0.0	0.329472107887	I want to see us do away with the gun show loophole.
0.0	0.331231805984	So that's what I'm focused on, that's what I've outlined and that's what I would do as president.
0.0	0.335245646442	And we can no longer continue to sweep it under the rug.
0.0	0.56769852816	I voted against the war.
0.0	0.385714598476	I don't think any -- I don't think any sensible person would disagree that the invasion of Iraq led to the massive level of instability we are seeing right now.
0.0	0.449244325421	Well, first of all the -- the plan gives people the option of -- of opting out.
0.0	0.304862857105	They didn't do that either.
0.0	0.397841417625	And -- and -- you know, the concept of New York values is not that complicated to figure out.
0.0	0.388792871802	I believe I can get the money that I need by taxing the wealthy, by closing loopholes, the things that we are way overdue for doing.
0.0	0.404450977967	And we need to hear the voices of those men and women and boys and girls who feel like strangers in their own country and do whatever is necessary to not only deal with the immediate problems within the criminal justice system, but more opportunities, more jobs, better education so that we can begin to rebuild that very valuable asset known as trust.
0.0	0.181685628993	I think you're --
0.0	0.293543004814	Our role in the world is to make ourselves a beacon of hope.
0.0	0.380202285418	But everything will be filed eventually with the government, and we don't extensions or anything.
0.0	0.266973868884	We need to stop that.
0.0	0.211240512065	Please reconsider, I'll say no.
0.0	0.489056224189	I believe that we need to cut these taxes down, we need to be on a roadmap to balancing the budget, and we need to send power, money, and influence, the welfare department, the education department, job training, infrastructure, Medicaid, all of that out of Washington back to the states so we can run these programs from where we live to the top, not a one size fits all mentality that they have in Washington.
0.0	0.356830902183	is exactly the leadership we need in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.303248752533	Well I think a lot of people are understandably reacting out of fear and anxiety about what they're seeing.
0.0	0.290907496229	We need to move aggressively now.
0.0	0.455514715585	And that's what you'll hear from Hillary Clinton -- and I've already heard from her -- is that, send more money in Social Security, send more money in Medicare taxes, send more money for Medicaid, and that's gonna solve the problem.
0.0	0.391333102313	We need to be on the side that keeps Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.28706081884	I don't think anyone has a magical solution.
0.0	0.401677273129	She worked -- and many of us supported you -- in trying to rebuild that devastation.
0.0	0.240899302449	Well, I've learned the rules on this.
0.0	0.449884455138	I believe that when we have some 300 million guns in this country, I believe that when we have seen these horrific mass killings, not only in San Bernardino, but in Colorado and movie theaters in Colorado, I think we have got to bring together the vast majority of the people who do in fact believe in sensible gun safety regulations.
0.0	0.398925886511	And I'll tell you, Bret, I think that's a much more attractive vision for healthcare than the Washington-drive, top-down Obamacare that is causing so many millions of people to hurt.
0.0	0.461422004001	Listen, in any Republican primary, everyone is going to say they support the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.445195920298	You know, we are the only nation, only developed nation on the planet...
0.0	0.239545795339	It really is important that we go forward on this.
0.0	0.5763301277	... and 85 percent of gun owners agree.
0.0	0.352607941358	I'm asking folks not just to join my campaign, but join a cause.
0.0	0.430146415128	But also the biggest people (ph) -- now I've used that to my advantage as a business man, for my family, for myself.
0.0	0.46203580197	Well, you just -- you just listed a litany of discredited attacks from Democrats and my political opponents, and I'm not gonna waste 60 seconds detailing them all.
0.0	0.447649226111	...Or, even some famous Colorado brownies.
0.0	0.554144197979	I hire people, they do a Web site.
0.0	0.25204577141	Kathie, let me say this.
0.0	0.415269336916	The other issue is mental health.
0.0	0.354517243601	... We're never going to win elections if we don't have a more broader unifying message.
0.0	0.429825459457	There is a bill sitting in the House that would actually pass and have us go to zero-based budgeting so we know where every dime of your money is being spent instead of only talking about how much more we're going to spend year after year after year.
1.0	0.611271000339	Later that year, in 2004, John Kerry ran for president missing close to 60 to 70 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.692649490417	Fifty-one percent of high school African-American graduates are unemployed or underemployed.
0.0	0.367725366682	So, we're going to enforce the law, we're going to change policing practices, we're going to change incarceration practices, but we're also going to emphasize education, jobs, and housing.
0.0	0.526470416476	But what is to prevent a future liberal president or a liberal Congress from coming back and not just raising the income tax, but also raising that VAT tax, and that vat tax is really bad for seniors.
0.0	0.415764078481	I was a person who has dealt extensively with these homeland security issues.
0.0	0.477409829688	She admitted she had sent e-mails to her family saying, "Hey, this attack at Benghazi was caused by Al Qaida-like elements."
0.0	0.430954553345	Well, John, I think that we have to look at ISIS as the leading threat of an international terror network.
0.0	0.380168713477	So count me in as somebody who will not be listening to Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.374434201598	And now, like never before, we need our Muslim American neighbors to stand up and to -- and to be a part of this.
0.0	0.446088596058	We would still have sexism preventing women from getting equal pay.
0.0	0.358179965737	And now mom and dad can stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.
0.0	0.384741899281	And, in my opinion, the new China, believe it or not, in terms of trade, is Mexico.
0.0	0.360343115033	It's a disaster.
0.0	0.268727038119	Fiscal discipline, know what you're doing.
0.0	0.44391176926	You know, a minute ago, Neil asked: What has President Obama do -- done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns?
0.0	0.386332637088	It's perfectly legal in this country to change your mind.
0.0	0.366012412386	Well, thank you very much to CBS and everyone here this evening for giving us another chance to appear before you.
0.0	0.294251104513	We need to define the enemy.
0.0	0.321542624999	We have to get back into looking at what's causing it.
0.0	0.29206290774	But it's a falseness, and that's an authenticity problem -- that everybody he knows is not as perfect as him because we're all for amnesty.
0.0	0.369590968563	(inaudible).
0.0	0.419279185264	All of a sudden, at the last moment, this big car manufacturer, foreign, announces they're not going to Tennessee.
0.0	0.188945978408	I know how hard that is.
0.0	0.257881772524	They want to say they're getting some of the liberty vote.
0.0	0.378385334251	I would hope that, given the extraordinary capacities that the tech community has and the legitimate needs and questions from law enforcement, that there could be a Manhattan-like project, something that would bring the government and the tech communities together to see they're not adversaries, they've got to be partners.
0.0	0.398704207005	In my administration, we will help to make sure we bring people together in the Middle East, and we will fight ISIS and defeat them.
0.0	0.0	Yes.
0.0	0.402519049965	And I have to tell you, I would not want -- if I lived in Iowa, Terry Branstad administering my health care.
0.0	0.388827829521	You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president...
0.0	0.269437713806	I'm going to be introducing a plan which I call the 2020 Perfect Vision for America.
0.0	0.512877958963	It shifts it to the business, and it would allow middle class people to get a tax cut.
0.0	0.495494787537	But together, every single year, I expanded drug treatment funding within our city and then I expanded it in our state, and we were saving lives every single year doing the things that work, intervening earlier, understanding the continuum of care that's required until we got hit like every other state in the state -- in the United States, especially in New Hampshire and in the northeast with this opioid addiction, the over-prescribing.
0.0	0.314004818521	And so I think really that vote is going to stay in the Paul household.
0.0	0.373179698462	And that's just not acceptable.
0.0	0.290615193077	And that's why we must make sure we continue to frack.
0.0	0.223196559889	And, for those of us who are serious enough to run for president, think long and hard why we're here, and hopefully you'll know we're not here for ourselves.
0.0	0.329692843255	I think on Article V of NATO, we would definitely protect all of our allies.
0.0	0.209117319515	You're right.
0.0	0.398920313259	We have to eliminate the sequester, rebuild our military in a way that makes it clear that we're back in the game.
0.0	0.374556040612	Conservatives, I am a conservative because I believe no one of us is any better than any other one of us.
0.0	0.489857840404	... wants to face Donald Trump in the general election.
0.0	0.45064843339	But realistically, even if they do, the money is flowing.
0.0	0.443221905583	We need to solve problems, we need to rebuild our military so we can stand up to radical Islam, we need to get our economy growing much faster by throwing out the corrupt tax code and lowering the rates.
0.0	0.304785995944	But this is what we also have to say.
0.0	0.393255162709	Number one, if they violate it, we need to move against them.
0.0	0.483980355091	It means that we have to rethink the so-called war on drugs which has destroyed the lives of millions of people, which is why I have taken marijuana out of the Controlled Substance Act.
1.0	0.820633042469	And this is not the first time that he has criticized President Obama.
0.0	0.529923788259	I have more accountants than I have nurses.
0.0	0.409887108916	Well, let me say that I do believe that the vote on NSA made the country less safe.
0.0	0.55477486913	ISIS is now found in affiliates in over a dozen countries.
0.0	0.318324894812	We honest to god are here to get this country back on track.
0.0	0.324414069416	If I'm president, there won't be stupid deals anymore.
0.0	0.497761914132	We're nowhere close to a balanced budget or fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.339011396841	That's a hard road to walk.
0.0	0.268206385491	And, look, there are profound differences...
1.0	0.857790905794	Secretary Clinton changes her position on this every election year, it seems, having one position in 2000 and then campaigning against President Obama and saying we don't need federal standards.
0.0	0.471243156717	We saw it in the blimp.
0.0	0.384070248001	When do we beat Mexico at the border?
0.0	0.446851276434	Washington gets bigger, taxes get higher, and the American people feel more distance from our government.
0.0	0.373420752387	It better not be Bernie Sanders.
0.0	0.191400937243	And I'm confident we can do that.
0.0	0.372443490847	I agree with my colleagues.
0.0	0.581177611838	And the entire New York times attack -- is that I disclosed that loan on one filing with the United States Senate, that was a public filing.
0.0	0.358097940576	Hillary Rodham Clinton did that to our country.
0.0	0.38504738515	And Bernie Sanders will tell them that it's because of the rich.
0.0	0.369469029069	You also have to prove that you're going to pay these people more than you would pay someone else, so that you're not undercutting it by bringing in cheap labor.
0.0	0.425354115397	The American people have rejected your agenda and now you're trying to go around it.
0.0	0.545193752299	You know how much money we spent on polio last year in America?
0.0	0.309090574064	That's what our parents and grandparents always did.
0.0	0.212912698678	I have to tell you.
0.0	0.0	What do we do?
0.0	0.207061717707	I'll tell you how optimistic I am about America.
0.0	0.390298910015	This is about more than replacing a D with an R. We need a leader who will help us take our government back.
0.0	0.361609876827	Now, Donald...
1.0	0.857407263088	It is also the case that that Rubio-Schumer amnesty bill, one of the things it did is it expanded Barack Obama's power to let in Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.491050141521	There is no issue in American public policy that I have worked on more day in and day out than this painful issue of policing, of law enforcement, criminal justice and race in America.
0.0	0.573592406702	When I was running for senate just about every lobbyist, just about all of the establishment opposed me in the senate race in Texas and my opponent in that race was worth over 200 million dollars.
0.0	0.574424996368	Those costs are then added to the overall cost, which does increase the insurance premiums for people in the private system.
0.0	0.474523287971	We did it, and it worked, and nobody headed for the hills or left the state because of it.
0.0	0.516155460801	I believe capital gains, for the most part, should be taxed the same way we tax income from hard work, sweat, and toil.
0.0	0.313074734697	But all of these politicians that I'm running against now, they're trying to disassociate.
0.0	0.678209896244	We increased education funding by 37 percent.
0.0	0.442702458198	It was LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations in this country.
0.0	0.301128962881	Because, I've got to tell you the truth, even in New Jersey what you're doing is called rude.
0.0	0.0	How about this?
0.0	0.417689859776	It's gonna be the best hotel in Washington, D.C. We got it from the General Services Administration in Washington.
0.0	0.393040325763	And the bottom line is this, we are not going to be able to do anything on this issue until we first bring illegal immigration under control.
0.0	0.418146321791	Because when government gets big and powerful, the big feel like they need to get even bigger to deal with all that power, and meanwhile, the small and the powerless -- in this case, 1,590 community banks -- go out of business.
0.0	0.428825335184	Have you ever disagreed with a president?
0.0	0.287727564151	Look, I served on...
0.0	0.407415758591	Exactly what to do as it relates to ISIS.
0.0	0.294356995825	They're absolutely false.
0.0	0.336249923973	I never said that Ms. Davis should either lose her job or that she had to do it.
0.0	0.474735167716	I lead the opposition against it.
0.0	0.246608190598	Look what they did in San Bernardino.
0.0	0.411582162349	If you looking at what happened with Boeing and if you look at what happened with so many companies that deal -- so we don't have an equal playing field.
0.0	0.523092535015	That's the secondary issue.
0.0	0.362483149225	We have to come together as a country.
0.0	0.461533015594	Could I -- could I bring something up here, because I'm a constituent of the senator and I helped him and I expected that he would do constituent service, which means that he shows up to work.
0.0	0.368081323158	This is the new sort of challenge, the new sort of threat that does, in fact, require new thinking, fresh approaches and new leadership.
0.0	0.428744592939	But I went further than that.
0.0	0.433395425472	And we know of the tragic, terrible event that lead to the death of Dontre Hamilton right here in Milwaukee, a young man unarmed, who should still be with us.
0.0	0.410406748594	Guns, in and of themselves, in my opinion, will not make Americans safer.
0.0	0.279543958949	Let me respond to...
0.0	0.412880137867	So the things I have done in office are the things that actually invest in growing our economy and making wages go up.
0.0	0.466448894262	One of your colleagues interviewed me.
0.0	0.0	And how do I know it?
0.0	0.479095989644	What I believe is the United States, in fact, should join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee healthcare to all people.
0.0	0.325767467042	But when you didn't do that and you ask people to support, you shouldn't cut and run.
0.0	0.428559459219	You have to ban the people who are trying to hurt us.
0.0	0.509917316311	If you stack that up it would be a three-story building.
0.0	0.431314374588	Well, that creates an environment that's toxic in our own country.
0.0	0.219876958425	Look, that's who I stand up for.
0.0	0.420667651095	We lose with ISIS.
0.0	0.324713898221	I said we should go to 65, but only if we have as careful a screening and vetting process as we can imagine, whatever resources it takes because I do not want us to, in any way, inadvertently allow people who wish us harm to come into our country.
0.0	0.251761932099	I'm proud that I gave him that advice.
0.0	0.455665338828	Well, of course, each of these cases needs to be looked at individually and analyzed.
0.0	0.450246320077	The dictatorships have suppressed people's aspirations.
0.0	0.483125036827	We have to end crony capitalism in Washington, where the lobbyists and the powerful can get tax breaks and tax credits, and the American people don't get laws in their interest.
0.0	0.427941637151	And listen, there is a real difference between Marco's tax plan and mine.
0.0	0.254516571082	They don't know if it worked.
0.0	0.425458302655	We have to shut down, whether or not they're in prisons preaching or on -- in mosques preaching.
0.0	0.263395676698	Bigger than that?
0.0	0.400348221481	Crony capitalism is alive and well, and has been so in Washington, D.C. for decades.
0.0	0.27743765832	We need somebody that can take the brand of the United States and make it great again.
0.0	0.230980125908	Here is the one thing I'm not going to do.
1.0	0.724730096349	They knew that they were talking about trying to take our country and attack it.
0.0	0.370858228927	I'll bring back our jobs from China, from Mexico, from Japan, from so many places.
0.0	0.422017660568	You know, 200 years ago, America was founded on this powerful principle that our rights don't come from government.
0.0	0.409942864178	Well, Mr. Cooney, we've actually been focusing on border security to the exclusion of talking about comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.370517172318	You look at the kind of damage that two people that two people that got married, they were radicalized -- they got married, they killed 15 people in actually 15 -- going to be probably 16 but you look at that and you take a look -- a good strong look and that's what we have.
0.0	0.636906040914	So the total is $8,737,540,00.
0.0	0.457514894122	No, it is not throwing -- it is an extraordinary investment for this country.
0.0	0.446630822398	We also got rid of their chemical weapons, which was a big help, and we also went after a lot of the shoulder-fired missiles to round them up.
0.0	0.28768858077	You know the nice thing about the mainstream media, they don't hide their views.
0.0	0.42675294663	But those Muslim countries are going to have to lead the effort.
0.0	0.34590140993	They can provide resources.
0.0	0.491310043785	I also propose that we can pay for this with a tax on high volume trades and we need to because my dad came to college after World War II on a G.I.
0.0	0.420635257758	We have to be prepared to defend the American people, prepare them for a long war, stand up for the defense of this country, and stand up for the values of this country...
0.0	0.386570971567	We have no borders.
1.0	0.538060290768	According to the statistics that I'm familiar with, a black male baby born today stands a one in four chance of ending up in the criminal justice system.
0.0	0.228960835317	We need Jordan.
0.0	0.375637429712	These mythical Arab armies that my friends talk about that are going to protect us don't exist.
0.0	0.384474222957	We don't have a health care crisis in America, we have a health crisis.
0.0	0.400538965696	I would hold a Camp David summit with our Arab allies, not to talk them into this lousy deal with Iran, but to say to them, "what is it that you need to defeat ISIL?"
0.0	0.370699404775	And I think that's an important point to make because I'm going through and analyzing the points you were making, Martha.
0.0	0.427895280808	But I want to quickly say, one of the areas that Senator Sanders touched on in talking about education and certainly talking about health care is his commitment to really changing the systems.
0.0	0.250726992237	We needed 60.
0.0	0.248418959073	I'm running.
1.0	0.383266311931	We don't need the federal government to be involved in this at all.
1.0	0.688540383125	In the past he has called him weak.
0.0	0.171967417126	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
0.0	0.344789577021	I heard what they said.
0.0	0.454584579822	This is the first priority.
0.0	0.406402254214	If the right person asked them, they'd pay a fortune.
0.0	0.506208454397	I have so many Web sites, I have them all over the place.
0.0	0.581422596958	Number one, there are currently two hedge fund billionaires running ads against me here in New Hampshire.
0.0	0.247808836177	That's right.
0.0	0.549599290196	For both of them you have to gradually raise the age.
0.0	0.349200272373	Well, let me be clear, if Donald engages in insults or anybody else, I don't intend to reciprocate.
0.0	0.443888980601	Donald is right that China is running over President Obama like he is a child, President Obama is not protecting American workers and we are getting hammered.
0.0	0.259606793288	David, let me give you a little bit of background here.
0.0	0.198021193858	Creativity.
0.0	0.220513992587	You gotta be -- stick with it, and all that.
1.0	0.867223929797	We do what the American people want, to expand Social Security by $1,300 a year for people under $16,000, and we extend the life of Social Security for 58 years.
0.0	0.405631530906	What he said, and he said it in the last debate, it's simply not true.
0.0	0.52913036623	If a soldier has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.307598566674	You can't be in favor of defend us...
0.0	0.299779861887	I think we're at war with jihadists who have --
0.0	0.562893272463	Close the gun show loophole, close the online loophole and...
0.0	0.465367528675	I think half of the -- more than half of the people in my own state of Vermont, my guess here in New Hampshire, are gun owners.
0.0	0.40186986892	I do not believe that we need to wholesale destroy every American citizen's privacy in order to go after those that we know are suspect or are -- are already a problem.
0.0	0.247808836177	All right.
1.0	0.596861677155	It is a simple flat tax where for individuals, a family of four pays nothing on the first $36,000.
0.0	0.626505867724	I built a net worth of way over $10 billion, and I have done it four times out of hundreds.
0.0	0.444104518695	People are being released from jail without the education, without the job training, without the resources that they need to get their lives together, then they end up -- we're shocked that they end up back in jail again.
0.0	0.407600261034	Now, since September, the Constitution hasn't changed.
0.0	0.231410573179	You looking at me?
0.0	0.412821367592	I was recruited to H.P.
0.0	0.433796622313	When I am president of the United States, I'm going to side with Ronald Regan on this and not Nancy Pelosi and we are not having a vat tax.
0.0	0.255822640881	I'm just saying.
0.0	0.439953745281	For a start, they're going to start to pay their fair share of taxes.
0.0	0.354859564113	So, yes, we can talk about it as a racial issue.
0.0	0.22198857106	You get a lot of them that are overrated.
0.0	0.29288091166	But I think we have got to get our foreign policies and priorities right.
0.0	0.433559023907	I'd also go after these sanctuary cities, do everything we can to make sure that we are not -- that we are actually prosecuting and cutting off funding for cities that are harboring illegal aliens, and then finally making sure the IRS is not going after conservative or religious groups.
0.0	0.352325953919	It's really a question for all of us to answer, every single one of our children deserves the chance to live up to his or her god-given potential.
0.0	0.535636487987	There is broad consensus, 92 percent in the most recently poll of Americans want gun safety measures...
0.0	0.474119331677	We inherited a system that was set up during World War II; 170 million Americans get health insurance right now through their employers.
0.0	0.186540632487	I think he is right.
0.0	0.337303352252	But what happens if, God forbid, the next Barack Obama takes over, and the next Nancy Pelosi, and the next Harry Reid...
0.0	0.416293044495	I don't remember you ever complaining about John McCain's vote record.
0.0	0.482985076059	If I could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited.
0.0	0.418019256791	Our job has to be to recognize the conflict between the two.
0.0	0.418504838249	I will, with your help and support, lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.395657854234	Get rid of the fraud.
0.0	0.0	And you know what?
0.0	0.217558068686	You want to talk about what we're going to be up against next year?
0.0	0.410353718465	He is undermining our standing in the world.
0.0	0.437140213956	Fired, never hired again and probably shunned in their community.
0.0	0.41911669309	Like we have a -- we have a lot of work to do and we're the only nation on the planet that buries as many of our people from gun violence as we do.
0.0	0.35969773597	Our staffer at that point did exactly the right thing.
0.0	0.345677792823	It's very important we operate on both at the same time.
0.0	0.476338223449	Because, Martha, it would prevent people like the guy that just got charged yesterday perhaps from being able to buy combat assault weapons.
0.0	0.440715618433	How can you run for the Republican nomination and be for single- payer health care?
0.0	0.0	Yes.
0.0	0.399974595007	... and in this case, we probably let our lust for regime toppling get ahead of the practical considerations for stability in that region.
0.0	0.471472672369	ISIS has brought down a Russian airliner.
1.0	0.486259691213	They built a hotel.
0.0	0.613772798269	So beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given -- bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money.
0.0	0.262189394341	I didn't want guns.
0.0	0.457171571217	But those kinds of personal assessments and charges are ones that I find particularly troubling.
0.0	0.377665549309	And it is from the lessons from history that we do this because if we allow this to fester, we're going to have Islamic terrorism, multi-generations of it all across this country.
0.0	0.304098323007	Obama is going to be out playing golf.
0.0	0.440929338545	Let me agree with Governor O'Malley and let me agree with Secretary Clinton.
0.0	0.482604308595	Are you coming onboard a proposal?
0.0	0.378035744197	And my reading of the law and the Constitution convinces me that the President has the authority that he is attempting to exercise with respect to dreamers and their parents, because I think all of us on this stage agree that we need comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.23205353151	See, they don't like that.
0.0	0.399303072591	And why I am a staunch supporter of President Obama's principal accomplishment -- namely the Affordable Care Act -- is because I know how hard it was to get that done.
0.0	0.277763993349	That will change everything.
0.0	0.0	This is 2016.
0.0	0.266148728317	But I want to talk -- I want to talk about something else, because Secretary Clinton I think made some interesting and good points.
0.0	0.504622835371	Just for the record.
0.0	0.178257717474	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.477823205078	And it troubles me that people are rewarded for tearing down our country.
0.0	0.396024680232	CLINTON: Oh, wait a minute, senator.
0.0	0.39815508602	That was before he was running against me.
0.0	0.319905972949	They are trying to attack us here in America.
0.0	0.231485018234	We hear a lot of good plans.
0.0	0.63470030975	That is why I support a $12 national federal minimum wage.
0.0	0.413198963546	We ought to send some real junk, because, frankly, it would be -- we ought to send our surplus.
0.0	0.225366697222	He'll beg for a little while, and I'll say, "No interest."
0.0	0.176263382414	It is not tough talk.
0.0	0.47813446354	They have infrastructure.
0.0	0.266131897509	Let me get a chance to respond.
0.0	0.3705867774	Do I take the product?
0.0	0.462964449301	We bailed out Wall Street.
0.0	0.457909174267	John, I would disagree with Secretary Clinton respectfully on this score.
0.0	0.264692692074	David, thank you.
0.0	0.446399000031	They get them on the black market.
0.0	0.501255141342	... people all over this country -- not you, Secretary Clinton -- are shouting at each other.
0.0	0.226815613587	I think something has to change.
0.0	0.292071762627	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.316301323416	Many businessmen want to endorse me.
0.0	0.441073816684	...The other thing I'd like to make about our plan, one more point, it is the most pro growth tax plan that I can imagine because it doesn't tax investments at all.
0.0	0.180746857819	HEMMER: Wow.
0.0	0.266545269657	And I do not believe it's a good idea now.
0.0	0.296089161252	And I watch the speeches.
0.0	0.479325084299	Our healthcare is a horror show.
0.0	0.411945157818	That's not even an issue.
0.0	0.569490802133	Millions of people have high deductibles and co-payments.
0.0	0.404236590649	Martha -- I would just repeat that --
1.0	0.730481431787	In this case, our staff did the wrong thing -- they looked a that information.
0.0	0.419816501379	I looked into the eyes of Boy Scouts.
0.0	0.459163742091	But bottom line now, is in America, in the year 2015, any person who has the ability and the desire should be able to get an education, college education, regardless of the income of his or her family.
0.0	0.409888849565	And I will say this, this is going to be an election, in my opinion, that's based on competence.
0.0	0.357091915632	Well, I am going to answer your question, Neil.
0.0	0.412650240787	It requires tax cuts, because that sends a message to the job creators that things are headed the right way.
0.0	0.377491451581	They are doing everything they can to prevent the voices of Americans to be heard.
0.0	0.419768518218	And, here's what she said to the American people.
0.0	0.324223310142	Well, I think that they're be pretty smart, because I think a lot of the states will do the right thing, and I think those states that don't will pay a heavy penalty.
0.0	0.533092110914	I have been for the Brady bill, I have been against assault weapons.
0.0	0.535306421121	Spent the first seven years of his life in Fascist Italy, under Benito Mussolini.
0.0	0.50142161317	In fact, if my mother were secretary of treasury, we would not be in a deficit situation.
0.0	0.468989236435	So while other candidates will talk about the things they would like to do, I actually got these things done in a state that defended not only a AAA bond rating, but the highest median income in America.
0.0	0.27348053985	When I'm president, that will change.
0.0	0.495908269564	I've had the growth code (ph) there for about five years, and it's this specific program.
0.0	0.482140489845	For 30 years this country has been baited with that.
0.0	0.242425291168	I don't know where you...
0.0	0.424461019554	But I want to say a quick word about what Senator Sanders and then Governor O'Malley said.
0.0	0.475812949084	So this is a major epidemic, and it has hit New Hampshire and Vermont particularly hard.
0.0	0.361938118526	I can govern by bringing people together.
0.0	0.360843092901	They've been stepped on for too long in this society, and we are beginning to treat them.
0.0	0.216158907695	You're simply not.
0.0	0.388085528961	I will take her on, and when I take her on I guarantee you one thing, she will never get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.454325400853	We have this enormous mismatch because we have smaller and smaller families.
0.0	0.233613438499	A lot of interesting issues have come together.
0.0	0.377326872353	You got Kuwait and you got Qatar and you got Saudi Arabia.
0.0	0.251961742491	...I'm going to go to Washington to stop it...
0.0	0.353325507771	Thank you, good night and may the force be with you.
0.0	0.413880303763	And our adversaries continue to grow stronger.
0.0	0.0	...
0.0	0.63296242748	What the legislation is is $1.61 a week.
0.0	0.387926642414	They blow people up.
0.0	0.485225368194	Bill, here's the interesting position on this.
0.0	0.38732430768	The agreement on a cease-fire, though, is something that has to be implemented more quickly than the schedule that the Russians agreed to.
0.0	0.478068440546	There is no president, in my view, not Hillary Clinton, not Bernie Sanders, who has the capability or the power to take on Wall Street, large campaign donors, the corporate media, the big money interests in this country alone.
0.0	0.479989708259	Or a young woman who had been performing at President Obama's second inauguration coming home, absolutely stellar young woman, hanging out with her friends in a park getting shot by a gang member.
0.0	0.417847072083	We had a decision to make early on, do we do a Super PAC?
0.0	0.36542063281	But probably that was the most challenging because there was no certainty attached to it.
0.0	0.44208913297	First statement is, we tell the billionaire class, "they cannot have it all."
0.0	0.362143530269	And they say down as a group trying to make sure that we can begin to heal some of these problems that we see between community and police.
0.0	0.400620259592	From top to bottom.
0.0	0.501833284978	Islamic terrorism is eating up large portions of the Middle East.
0.0	0.480596119704	And it's the most regressive tax there is.
0.0	0.546438733438	No, the new planes.
0.0	0.56581589026	So we pay for this by do demanding that the wealthiest people and the largest corporations, who have gotten away with murder for years, start paying their fair share.
0.0	0.417269739182	And let me, by the way, take this moment to congratulate Hillary Clinton, who I thought not only did an outstanding job as our first lady, but redefined what that role could be.
0.0	0.0	But...
0.0	0.387223123684	I've heard a lot of hot rhetoric here tonight, but I've got to tell you, as somebody that actually passed a budget; that paid down a half-a-trillion dollars of our national debt, you can't do it alone.
0.0	0.272713431264	I will be ready.
0.0	0.382862277884	They're making a half, two-thirds what they used to make.
0.0	0.278291678483	Well, let me just -- let me just say, once again...
0.0	0.522065659682	Yes, does Wall Street and big financial interests, along with drug companies, insurance companies, big oil, all of it, have too much influence?
0.0	0.463264434194	Because they know that Hillary Clinton will never be prosecuted by this justice department, and they're going to want to put a former federal prosecutor on the stage to prosecute her next September.
0.0	0.51952009191	My name was invoked.
0.0	0.591123024952	It's tax-free -- a huge advantage for our farmers and ranchers and manufacturers -- and every import pays the 16 percent business flat tax.
0.0	0.209246427561	But you know, we don't want to put everybody in the same category.
0.0	0.356146858221	I think THAT you can talk about Islamists who clearly are also jihadists, but I think it's not particularly helpful to make the case that Senator Sanders was just making that I agree with, that we've got to reach out to Muslim countries.
0.0	0.239282994312	We get Bergdahl.
0.0	0.477985963397	OK. You know, you judge a nation not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how you treat, we treat, the most vulnerable and fragile people in our nation.
0.0	0.475930375606	If you -- we will not solve our nation's problems by resorting to the divisive ideologies of our past, or by returning to polarizing figures from our past.
0.0	0.385273196855	It's all about getting people to listen to one another's problems.
0.0	0.0	2,000?
0.0	0.228335298602	... not everybody else.
0.0	0.428516060261	I have said the invasion of Iraq was a mistake.
0.0	0.353950415384	I think it's important for people in elected office to try to forge consensus to solve problems.
0.0	0.43389265395	I will be that new leader.
0.0	0.484439313125	Hillary Clinton stored classified information on her private server.
0.0	0.262257368887	No vision at all.
0.0	0.342374490185	And that is that one of the things you're watching tonight are 11 quality candidates debating an important issue.
0.0	0.508628661495	I believe that we pay for many of the things that we need to do again as a nation, investing in the skills of our people, our infrastructure, and research and development and also climate change by the elimination of one big entitlement that we can no longer afford as a people, and that is the entitlement that many of our super wealthiest citizens feel they are entitled to pay -- namely, a much lower income tax rate and a lower tax rate on capital gains.
0.0	0.45651407714	I support NAFTA.
0.0	0.269196347123	We have work to do, and we now know a lot more than we ever did before.
0.0	0.526463847892	It's now half the size of what it was prior to Operation Desert Storm.
0.0	0.0	Why is that?
0.0	0.529734562986	And we have to cut off the flow of foreign funding and foreign fighters.
0.0	0.393596394773	I changed that.
0.0	0.388993750526	I mean, my dad went to college on a G.I.
0.0	0.347881671292	I'm glad that late last night, that was resolved.
0.0	0.437807200521	The secretary is right: Our people are fearful.
0.0	0.259826434753	You're going away for a long, long while.
0.0	0.477735622229	Every election we talk about Medicare and Social Security reform.
0.0	0.461248565472	I will cut this government down to size and hold it accountable, simplify the tax code, roll back the regulations that have been spewing out of Washington, D.C. for 50 years.
0.0	0.302356941296	And we can do it again together, all of us, to strengthen this country, work together.
0.0	0.520981838833	We expand Medicare to all people.
0.0	0.479859504078	We are nineteen trillion dollars -- our country's a mess and we can't let all these people come into our country and break our borders.
0.0	0.486580762003	We came back from the dead.
0.0	0.450214718053	What we have got to do is make it clear that any police officer who breaks the law will, in fact, be held accountable.
1.0	0.652105727563	I have not insulted Donald personally and I don't intend to.
0.0	0.345051802453	We're going to bring jobs back from Japan, we're going to bring jobs back from China, we're going to bring, frankly, jobs back from Mexico where, as you probably saw, Nabisco is leaving Chicago with one of their biggest plants, and they're moving it to Mexico.
0.0	0.291459675558	If he'd like to play, that's fine.
0.0	0.388258759642	This was a question on entitlements.
0.0	0.446433432979	Look, I don't believe there's the model -- there's lots of good people that work in finance, Secretary Sanders, but Secretary Clinton, we need to step up and we need to protect Main Street from Wall Street and you can't do that by -- by campaigning as the candidate of Wall Street.
0.0	0.395635971214	I have a problem with that, Martha.
0.0	0.370234978954	So, here's a couple of stories happened recently.
0.0	0.478231172383	China doesn't pay the tariff, the buyer pays the tariff.
0.0	0.445788580914	There are other racial discrepancies.
0.0	0.233133834952	And I mean, are you kidding me?
0.0	0.227076939142	Everybody should.
0.0	0.409942206952	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.378867206502	That is absolutely inaccurate.
0.0	0.348864003255	I'm angry because our country is a mess.
0.0	0.475623514073	Furthermore, in a competitive global economy, it is imperative that we have the best educated workforce in the world.
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.51573197551	There is one major country -- the United States -- which ends up spending almost three times per capita what they do in the U.K. guaranteeing health care to all people, 50 percent more than they do in France guaranteeing health care to all people, far more than our Canadian neighbors, who guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.453384942941	I just left Indonesia -- bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb.
0.0	0.280755430375	I think we're missing the point here.
0.0	0.388208423099	That is the fight we have to have, and we have to undo a whole set of things that President Obama has done that get at the heart of his disrespect and disregard for too many Americans.
0.0	0.279060248036	Let's talk about something that happened this week in the news.
0.0	0.596324117419	We eliminate the payroll tax, we eliminate the Obamacare taxes.
0.0	0.439835635702	Could we have your support?
1.0	0.453307223355	They just built a hotel in Syria.
0.0	0.219936970732	I think if it doesn't...
0.0	0.380183236878	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the Constitution.
0.0	0.458879109235	The endorsements that I am proud of are leading conservatives like Iowa's own Congressman Steve King, who is a national co-chairman of my campaign.
0.0	0.452497764996	When I'm president, we are rebuilding the U.S. military because the world is a safer and a better place when America is the strongest military in the world.
0.0	0.523026185644	And if I am elected president, to every soldier and sailor and airman and marine, and to every police officer and firefighter and first responder who risk their lives to keep us safe, I will have your back.
0.0	0.558427271928	Well, why do they make millions of dollars of campaign contributions?
0.0	0.251289043336	Well, John, I don't really have any weaknesses that I can think of.
0.0	0.538068837615	You have two billionaire hedge fund managers who started a super PAC and they're advertising against me in Iowa as we speak.
0.0	0.320738022621	But we stuck to our message.
0.0	0.360487369728	Reforms, everything from moral and cultural issues to economic issues.
0.0	0.351735513783	And they will work with me to get comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.224912482595	What we could have done if they had said yes would have been a lot more than what we were able to have done.
1.0	0.523938442532	And I'm very proud that for the first time a majority of my donors are women, 60 percent.
0.0	0.307383925285	They can't.
0.0	0.266853143943	Let me put those proposals-- and you're absolutely right.
0.0	0.468135389636	I like Marco too, and two years ago, he called me a conservative reformer that New Jersey needed.
0.0	0.301306699108	We have not made the investments that we need to make to understand and to have relationships with future leaders that are coming up.
0.0	0.318974016237	Now, we're going to blame the people.
0.0	0.476235117601	Had that actually -- that same columnist wrote a column comparing me to an evil demonic spirit from the move, "It Follows" that jumps apparently from body to body possessing people.
0.0	0.393874047102	Do people not care about all of our sacrifice?
0.0	0.217596473165	And they'll be proud, and they'll love it, and they'll make much more than they would've ever made, and they'll be -- they'll be doing so well, and we're going to be thriving as a country, thriving.
0.0	0.393305802979	I think we ought to put in our missile defense system.
0.0	0.313582012896	That's when we become Greece.
0.0	0.422155903716	We need someone with a steady hand being president of the United States.
0.0	0.412880408161	Hillary Clinton this week said Barack Obama would make a great Supreme Court justice.
0.0	0.48961813321	They're gonna spend their $1 billion in Mexico instead.
0.0	0.656912439751	And there are 48 million people involved -- 40 million, 65 and over, and 8 million other.
0.0	0.436532958677	But at the same time with new technologies I believe that the people creating these projects -- I mean these products also have an obligation to come together with law enforcement to figure these things out; true to our American principles and values.
0.0	0.404039506753	I mean, she would drive a car until it wouldn't make a sound, and then gather up all her coins and buy a new car.
0.0	0.259520721995	So let's focus on what this election is really going to be about.
0.0	0.427996727298	They like General Motors, so they give them a pass.
0.0	0.536919469814	Under that theory, not only would I be disqualified, Marco Rubio would be disqualified, Bobby Jindal would be disqualified and, interestingly enough, Donald J. Trump would be disqualified.
0.0	0.446885240319	You know, I completely agree with Senator Sanders.
1.0	0.886175072089	And what that's led to over $2 trillion of American companies' monies that are being kept offshore, because they don't want to pay the second tax.
0.0	0.237065997053	You've got to give people hope.
0.0	0.326579951914	That's how I focused from the beginning of the campaign and it is how I intend to continue going forward.
1.0	0.706738426732	The reason we are in the mess we're in, that ISIS has the territory it has, is because of Assad.
0.0	0.232950826991	I need your help.
0.0	0.211903760559	Yeah, but let me respond...
0.0	0.414970540426	And I also want to recognize the people in that church that showed the grace of God and the grace of forgiveness and the mercy that they showed.
0.0	0.0	No -- no...
0.0	0.217394582543	I have a feeling it's going to work out, actually.
0.0	0.196283652949	Let it be for everybody.
0.0	0.197803465385	And I've got to tell you, it sounded like everything in the world was going amazing, you know?
0.0	1.0	Of course.
0.0	0.41884462307	And we should never be convinced to give up those freedoms in exchange for a promise of greater security; especially from someone as untried and as incompetent as Donald Trump.
0.0	0.206615156207	You know, I've always had a great deal of respect.
0.0	0.476209737393	But in terms of shutting down the government, I don't think President Obama should choose to shut down the government simply to send taxpayer dollars to this group that has been caught, I believe, breaking the law, but also offending our values and our ethics.
1.0	0.366770254083	They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us.
0.0	0.389269240438	We're rebuilding many countries.
0.0	0.419958039436	They're not going to turn into stockbrokers overnight or open up a chain of car washes.
0.0	0.433002928646	So what I would say is, number one, we need to be united against the threats that we face.
0.0	0.168745728333	I think he'd be a great spirit."
0.0	0.419691234458	That is total propaganda, and this is what happens in our society.
0.0	0.4254215043	Absolutely, because what we will do is say, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so they're not hanging out on street corners.
0.0	0.0	Not at all.
0.0	0.422534848733	But also where it's affordable, solar, wind in Iowa has become very affordable and it makes sense.
0.0	0.437481091453	This country is changing.
0.0	0.308898140059	Somebody says "I'm a fighter."
0.0	0.391737155002	And Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being the commander-in-chief of the United States.
0.0	0.391306979291	Well, first of all, I've seen polls where I'm beating Hillary Clinton pretty regularly.
0.0	0.365520890838	The central question in this race is trust.
0.0	0.570472000029	People lost their jobs, their homes, their life savings.
0.0	0.351097399009	Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point?
0.0	0.463513955185	I have said that we could leave it to the states but I've also introduced a federal solution as well.
0.0	0.493139158532	I have a way to pay for it that actually makes the wealthiest pay for it...
0.0	0.0	Thank you.
0.0	0.422234303648	I think that there are many other reasons why it has in addition to what happened in the region, but I don't think that the United States has the bulk of the responsibility.
0.0	0.386310277394	Well, I think there are some differences of opinion here, perhaps between the secretary and myself.
0.0	0.31655615474	Or, are you going to deal with the problem by saying, I'm going to give people who've done well in this country less benefit on the backend.
0.0	0.403801847529	My background is different.
0.0	0.364332439267	Their kids come out of college, they have high debt and they can't get a good job.
0.0	0.520601178877	But all of my career, you know, having been raised in -- by a mailman father whose father was a coal miner, who died of black lung and was losing his eyesight; or a mother whose mother could barely speak English.
0.0	0.402803756029	It's labor, and it's unions good and some bad and lots of people that aren't in unions, and it's all over the place and building all over the world.
0.0	0.308452444515	And he got nasty.
0.0	0.217757376612	You've got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.31017800187	Take a look at the deal he's making with Iran.
0.0	0.353656817716	We saw what happened in Egypt.
0.0	0.344558929155	They go to Yale.
0.0	0.510275657822	Much of the discussion is centered over whether or not the different tax plans help, or affect the middle class.
0.0	0.606332122481	We got $18 trillion in debt.
0.0	0.478960447593	We should put the NSA in charge of the civilian side of this as well.
0.0	0.38242427165	We need to make sure that we do everything across all kinds of energy: natural gas, oil, absolutely.
0.0	0.22586736166	That's what should be done.
0.0	0.55113475106	Republican leadership joined with every single Democrat, add $80 trillion to our debt to do nothing to fix the problems.
0.0	0.40265386086	And Mexico's going to pay for the wall because Mexico -- I love the Mexican people; I respect the Mexican leaders -- but the leaders are much sharper, smarter and more cunning than our leaders.
0.0	0.228977937546	Sorry.
0.0	0.467471416552	They are the best funded radical jihadist group in the history of the world, and they have shown a sophisticated understanding of the laws of other countries on how to insert fighters into places, and they are actively plotting to attack us here at home and around the world.
0.0	0.269675177696	We have nothing.
0.0	0.464623048501	This is not some small scale group.
1.0	0.799478723694	You used to say that you were in favor of birthright citizenship, now you say that you are against it.
0.0	0.310287078171	I didn't say permanently.
0.0	0.354756799975	Well, there is no question that some people go overboard when it comes to trying to make profits, and they don't take into consideration the American people.
0.0	0.482373268546	But view is those trade policies have enabled corporate America to shut down in this country, throw millions of people out on the street.
0.0	0.526279368581	And, where we are failing abysmally is in the very high rate of recidivism we see.
0.0	0.490312603894	The troops on the ground should not be American troops.
0.0	0.34207005901	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.448038055655	Well, Bret, first that's not entirely the story.
0.0	0.440789742436	We don't represent Wall Street, we don't represent the billionaire class, so it ends up I'm the only candidate up here of the many candidates who has no Super PAC.
0.0	0.475666696425	Their business model is greed and fraud.
0.0	0.424801690434	Work requirements and time limits.
0.0	0.305289861773	How would we act?
0.0	0.335863987183	And our economy was growing like crazy.
0.0	0.496048193466	It had to be bailed out and it nearly destroyed us.
0.0	0.338145449366	And they're looking around them, and they're looking at Washington, and they're saying the rich are getting much richer, I'm getting poorer, what are you going to do about it?
0.0	0.369947734887	What we have to do right now is bring our people together and understand that we must provide a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people.
0.0	0.480869944776	There's a reason the NRA gave me their Carter Knight Freedom Fund award...
0.0	0.216436691041	Oh, great.
0.0	0.586785402445	It is not because of the tax writeoff.
0.0	0.31770388332	What a brilliant idea that would be.
0.0	0.409853090938	Probably in terms of the applying for the job of president, a weakness would be not really seeing myself in that position until hundreds of thousands of people began to tell me that I needed to do it.
0.0	0.522364691246	John, thank you, and to all of the people in Iowa, for the role you have performed in this presidential selection process.
0.0	0.469486405894	Manufacturing will flow back into this country.
0.0	0.395520922314	And Dulce Candy -- a pretty cool name, actually -- that is now an entrepreneur over Youtube is part of that American spirit, and we should celebrate it as conservatives.

0.0	0.359850679712	I think, actually, people are looking for that in Washington now.

1.0	0.719936145484	I'll tell you what else they're upset about: you're 50 or 51 years old, and some kid walks in and tells you you're out of work, and you don't know where to go and where to turn.
0.0	0.427083536583	... believe me the world is peanuts by comparison.
0.0	0.294378951385	But I think to suggest that I have voiced criticism, this blurb that you talk about, you know what the blurb said?

0.0	0.496738576738	Now, as far as the renewable fuel standard is concerned, certain promises were made, certain government contracts were issued which extend all the way into the year 2022, and I believe that it's probably unfair to withdraw the rug because people have invested money.
0.0	0.271539076345	It was terrible.
0.0	0.37483815241	We need to use our technological advantages, because what we've warned of is an international guerrilla movement that threatens this country.

0.0	0.304615441343	Look, the secretary is right.
0.0	0.322058626809	They like to ask direct questions.
0.0	0.527352554171	Those jobs, in many cases, are now gone.

0.0	0.409589419972	And I was clear about that at the time.
0.0	0.453868631411	For example, before you hire anyone from abroad, you should have to advertise that job for 180 days.
0.0	0.488861915708	We have people that are selling this country down the drain.
0.0	0.406795170487	Ohio, one of the best growing places in the country -- I not only did it in Washington, I did it in Ohio, and I'll go back to Washington, and there will be no more silly deals...
0.0	0.503294107885	So I believe that over the next few years, not tomorrow, but over the next few years, we have got to move the minimum wage to a living wage, 15 bucks an hour.
0.0	0.535607583509	Well, and specifically to Medicare, Becky, because 85 percent of the cost of Medicare is chronic disease.
0.0	0.407974200829	I don't know if any of us could have done what they did, one after another, within 48 hours of that tragedy taking place.
0.0	0.428859366065	We have not provided them.
0.0	0.349754670768	And it was not only a great accomplishment of the Democratic Party, but of President Obama.
1.0	0.694234281769	It was an effort led by several people that provided almost an instant path with very little obstacles moving forward.
0.0	0.356583317771	That's how you go from secretary to CEO.

0.0	0.170726313746	Everybody knows that.
0.0	0.41646830944	I mean, that's just the bottom line.
1.0	0.702793469379	It enabled him -- the president to certify them en masse without mandating meaningful background checks.
0.0	0.341740497534	But what I did say was that the person who came in for the license needed to get it.
0.0	0.3324662931	They're sending us not the right people.
0.0	0.0	No.
0.0	0.246107721475	We're becoming Greece if we don't work together.

0.0	0.449559178809	You know where their United States headquarters is located?
0.0	0.46485637591	We have arrived at a point in our nation's history where the potential of this nation and too many Americans is being crushed by the weight, the power, the cost, the complexity, the ineptitude, the corruption of the federal government, and only someone who will challenge the status quo of Washington, D.C. can lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.471286252987	And you don't go tell Muslim nations you want them to be part of a coalition when you have a leading candidate for president of the United States who insults their religion.
0.0	0.292253576781	We can't do this unilaterally.
0.0	0.419372943663	So, I think gun-free zones are a catastrophe.
0.0	0.0	You do.
0.0	0.37980174889	We have more Americans out of work or just Americans who quit looking for work for 40 years.
0.0	0.417213753346	But it is not the world -- the role of traveling the world looking for new monsters to destroy.
0.0	0.327268750923	I said, "I think that number one, I am a nice person.
0.0	0.368502839003	But I said, "Don't hit Iraq," because you're going to totally destabilize the Middle East.
0.0	0.426525411737	Our differences are fairly deep on this issue.
0.0	0.160361868401	I think that is...
0.0	0.361583515828	It will give hope to millions of young people.
0.0	0.437097003429	The question always is, what works better, the private marketplace or government?
0.0	0.466251199554	That is not protected free speech.
0.0	0.473517697126	For example, it is outrageous that we don't have an opportunity for Medicare to negotiate for lower prices.
0.0	0.296746838789	Thank you Chris...
0.0	0.408389250825	In this particular moment of serious crises, saying to the American people don't give up on the political process.
0.0	0.328943053352	... Chris, keep it coming...
0.0	0.34443733928	I want to build on and improve the Affordable Care Act.
0.0	0.267423559999	And we need to make that very clear to everybody.
0.0	0.386726313932	And I've heard some great ideas about how law enforcement is changing its behavior, how the recovery community is reaching out.
0.0	0.301623367717	We have all the cards, but we don't know how to use them.
0.0	0.547879900803	John, I had the honor of being chairman of the U.S. Senate committee on Veterans' Affairs for two years.
0.0	0.427575771441	Maria, I'd like to interrupt this debate on the floor of the Senate to actually answer the question you asked, which was on entitlements.
0.0	0.456429370517	I like Chris Christie, but we can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports Common Core.
1.0	0.380866132688	Even our nuclear arsenal doesn't work.
0.0	0.495446176451	... in addition to that, we go ahead and we take the oil from them, their source of revenue.
0.0	0.31678780765	Our country doesn't win anymore.
0.0	0.451056205363	You know, no public policy doesn't have, in some cases, negative consequences.
0.0	0.326874398535	We need to move on this consensus that exists in the country.
0.0	0.234450928838	Well, you know what I'm worried about?
0.0	0.34581093392	I'm very much against the government being involved in every aspect of our lives, you know?
0.0	0.424004538222	On welfare.
0.0	0.301699407976	We're dying.
0.0	0.0	...
1.0	0.863540736154	And we were able to put our city on the path for the biggest reduction in crime of any major city in America over the next ten years.
0.0	0.398791620149	They're looking -- they're looking to manipulate our -- the visa waiver countries to get people into the United States.
0.0	0.353515252338	I think, though, government is too big now.
0.0	0.420970579798	It's also about choosing our next commander-in-chief.
0.0	0.382050660742	And the people of New Jersey, I've seen it.
0.0	0.302007638272	It's not only a problem here.
0.0	0.451846736003	If you're living on the edge of poverty and you get a $100 fine or your car towed, a lot of times you lose your job.
0.0	0.260129572377	It's easier to talk to your friends.
0.0	0.606405914708	... the mandates and have a simple flat tax.
0.0	0.267166372338	We have the opposite thinking.
0.0	0.51925974611	We have to shut down their internet capability.
0.0	0.406008216206	Who do you know will stop amnesty and secure the borders?
0.0	0.444479055325	I cautioned about a quick overthrow of Mubarak, and we now are back with basically an army dictatorship.
0.0	0.25421970554	Well, I don't know.
0.0	0.294368511164	If you've got 10 people coming to your house and you know one of them is a terrorist, you're probably going to keep them all out.
0.0	0.490496489996	ISIS is the most dangerous jihadist group in the history of mankind.
0.0	0.321525844066	It's true, and these are the best and the finest.
0.0	0.380110469506	If you don't have talented people, if you don't have great leadership, if you don't have people that know business, not just a political hack that got the job because he made a contribution to a campaign, which is the way all jobs, just about, are gotten, free trade terrible.
0.0	0.38847804787	So whether it's green cards or any other form of entry into America, when I'm president if we do not know who you are or why you are coming, you are not going to get into the United States of America.
0.0	0.348211660277	This is the unholy alliance that people need to know about between right and left.
0.0	0.256458711191	Please think of our founding fathers as you listen.
0.0	0.218826890208	It never happens.
0.0	0.424503722451	Right and left are spending us into oblivion.
1.0	0.886033948654	We're spending $80 billion a year locking up fellow Americans.
0.0	0.290745235823	They haven't done that.
0.0	0.334649614797	They beat us all the time.
0.0	0.358428864882	That is exactly what I just said and what I just described.
0.0	0.338191694132	But the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with Iran, maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world, yes, that is something I want to achieve.
0.0	0.290943419368	They're killing us.
0.0	0.422965742341	Since he has been making all kinds of comments.
0.0	0.278783989162	You know, everyone here talks about the need to take on Washington.
0.0	0.322614156098	We must keep America safe from this threat.
0.0	0.350225684826	But I would say this to you, Bret.
0.0	0.515066006485	As a matter of fact, if you're Hispanic or African-American in Texas, you have the number one high school graduation rates in America.
0.0	0.252577910022	I think we all support that.
0.0	0.260861416636	I get to respond, right?
0.0	0.508029158141	We have $2.5 trillion outside of the United States which we want to bring back in.
0.0	0.439753265446	He just writes out an executive order.
0.0	0.449230099026	I'm the only one on this stage who has a plan that's actually reduced -- actually going to reduce immigration.
0.0	0.363580652011	Eradicate those and you fix Medicare and you've fixed America, its economy and you've made people's lives a heck of a lot better.
0.0	0.440809751524	We differ, however, on a couple of key points.
0.0	0.501710388255	And I recognize -- I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa.
0.0	0.503121326829	Where I see the weakness is in those three people that are left on the Democratic stage.
0.0	0.443662526413	And Secretary Clinton, unfortunately, is on the wrong side.
1.0	0.793864550971	It absolutely has been, and at the time in the context of that was in 2009, and 2010, where the last effort for legalization was an effort done in the Senate.
0.0	0.564884776851	I do believe that in the year 2016 we have to look in terms of public education as colleges as part of public education making public colleges and universities tuition free.
0.0	0.254746864621	I'm going to do what it takes to defend this nation.
0.0	0.29118356245	And you talk so much that nobody can ever keep up with what you're saying is accurate or not.
0.0	0.232990376958	And I think together we will make progress.
0.0	0.337036889683	But the other thing I just wanted quickly to say is, I think President Obama deserves more credit than he gets for what he got done in Washington, despite the Republican obstructionists.
0.0	0.259169138941	We can develop that, you know?
0.0	0.528996186032	Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the co-chair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat.
0.0	0.379372332862	O' Malley: John, please, it's-- personal privilege, John.
0.0	0.0	We do.
0.0	0.309438536535	I'm not fighting that.
0.0	0.504938215463	The biggest tax increase happened under the watch of Barack Obama, and spending's gone up.
0.0	0.332160432076	We need a leader that will fix things and have a proven record to do it.
0.0	0.402821177452	And it's-- it's a worthy debate.
0.0	0.309753935925	There are hundreds of things like that.
0.0	0.309497304981	We need sound money.
0.0	0.447966428103	But if I become president, I couldn't care less about my company.
0.0	0.337689032574	You know, it's real estate.
0.0	0.535175783077	We called Ben, he was with me 100%.
0.0	0.328911868032	I love this country.
0.0	0.274808348637	You know, I think abortion is always wrong.
0.0	0.0	And you know what?
0.0	0.383512684439	So let's move toward what we should be doing as a nation and follow the values of our immigration history and begin to make it possible for them to come out of the shadows and to have a future that gives them a full chance of citizenship.
0.0	0.489488991	In fact, one of her first acts as president may very well be to pardon herself because Hillary Clinton...
0.0	0.37711754317	And we finally need to tackle the basics to cut this government down to size and hold it accountable.
0.0	0.393457804542	But the thing that is most important to me and caused me to run for office is I'm worried about the country and how much debt we're adding.
0.0	0.341451930978	I kind of miss Donald Trump.
0.0	0.357165834966	I think America is just a few good decisions and a leadership change at the top away from the best years we've ever had.
0.0	0.422370977414	Look, this is a tragedy for New Hampshire.
0.0	0.430281377872	If you elect me president of the United States, I will secure that southern border.
0.0	0.501472613493	Because, first of all, you may rename the IRS but you are not going to abolishes the IRS, because there has to be some agency that's going to collect your vat tax.
0.0	0.478023751709	About every two weeks, he holds a press conference talking about how he can't wait to restrict people's access to guns.
0.0	0.576986853795	Prior to that, in the Reagan Library, I gave a detailed plan.
0.0	0.40514798516	We need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources, but from sources overseas, that can be a real-time fusion effort to get information where it's needed.
0.0	0.444989533761	But, of course, international terrorism is a major issue that we have got to address today.
0.0	0.333992508471	But what we need to do is turn it over to the regional powers to be able to handle that.
0.0	0.421208700541	Nobody would be tougher on ISIS than Donald Trump.
0.0	0.321995552065	Let's put the gun makers and sellers on notice that they're not going to get away with it.
0.0	0.501004668326	I am proud that I was the first member of Congress to take Americans over the Canadian border to buy breast cancer drugs for one-tenth the price they were paying in the United States.
1.0	0.716866765778	As soon as we learned that they looked at that information - we fired that person.
0.0	0.302518075933	John, I think somewhere between...
0.0	0.391958548784	That's get rid of Planned Parenthood funding from the United States of America.
0.0	0.36304395444	But the president needs to be laying the groundwork right now for the ability to slap those sanctions back on worldwide.
0.0	0.440696512802	So many companies are going to leave our country.
0.0	0.43076206309	That's his first responsibility.
0.0	0.474104564994	That is like asking the arsonist to come and pour more gas on the fire.
0.0	0.594489081274	Saudi Arabia, they make $1 billion a day.
0.0	0.5397818531	And what you're going to see in Washington this week is establishment Republicans have made an agreement with the president to raise the debt ceiling in an unlimited fashion; no limit to the debt ceiling raise.
0.0	0.490137591071	And until we deal with the health of Americans and do what we did with polio -- when I was a little kid, we eradicated it.
0.0	0.428075385202	That's fine.
0.0	0.488807404903	One thing I like to remind people is, back in 2007, Rudy Giuliani was leading the polls for almost a year.
0.0	0.392972773092	In other words, the very rich are getting richer, almost everybody is going -- getting poorer.
0.0	0.517246300178	And if this humanitarian crisis increases, we should accept more.
0.0	0.429248994827	I have talked to some of the young kids with tears rolling down their cheeks, are scared to death that today they may or their parents may be deported.
0.0	0.477453295387	And John Kerry described it as attacks that would be unbelievably small.
0.0	0.438289337985	But when we came to Washington, we made a different choice.
1.0	0.681542494428	The blurb said that the next president of the United States has got to be aggressive in bringing people into the political process.
0.0	0.461539773912	My son is not a pair of boots on the ground.
0.0	0.361381571462	Who denies that it is crazy...
0.0	0.452886941246	Maybe that is normal politics in Washington, but that is not the politics of higher purpose that people expect from our party.
0.0	0.488846930383	When he ran for election in the state of Florida, he told the people of Florida, "if you elect me, I will lead the fight against amnesty."
0.0	0.432624359348	(APPLAUSE) This is not a cage match.
0.0	0.324701976783	And we need the right people.
0.0	0.366934225476	But let's be clear: Russia's aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO -- correctly, I believe -- are saying, you know what, we're going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action.
0.0	0.44049898536	Those are the hard numbers.
0.0	0.248579628059	Now we hear the tough talk.
0.0	0.457989754203	That expertise needs to spread all across the government and there needs to be much more cooperation with our private sector.
0.0	0.42382341923	And, that will get to the nub of opportunity for our children, and an ability to see wages rise.
0.0	0.458164246386	I believe in government, but I believe in efficient government, not wasteful government.
0.0	0.398820604087	In fact, what that hurts is hurt hardworking taxpayers.
0.0	0.176210232732	We've got nothing.
0.0	0.467092403161	In fact, just last week, I introduced the Life at Conception act, which would say that the 14th amendment would defend an individual even in the womb.
0.0	0.587810461723	And I have set forth a compact that would do just that for debt-free tuition.
0.0	0.469373725601	We could turn off that spigot by charging them tax until they behave properly.
0.0	0.397441168512	So ladies and gentlemen...I am officially running...... for president of the United States, and we are going to make our country great again.
0.0	0.425595657095	And I can do it regardless of what the makeup of Congress is because I did it in New York state.
0.0	0.408119786316	Did a couple of cataract surgeries over Christmas holidays.
0.0	0.442049810013	After the war we had all of these kids, Baby Boomers.
0.0	0.455629323464	... No, I said I do not support blanket amnesty...
0.0	0.599713221285	This is money that people have confiscated out of their paychecks.
0.0	0.432113750952	And with your vote and your support and your prayers, I will lead with the citizens of this great nation the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.0	Not -- not on that, no.
0.0	0.37990046845	There is so much wealth out there that can make our country so rich again, and therefore make it great again.
0.0	0.343544493465	You know, after 9/11, one of the efforts that we did in New York was if you see something or hear something suspicious, report it.
0.0	0.310915792524	It's coming from more than Mexico.
0.0	0.445972640345	Our vets have been abandoned.
0.0	0.538194732432	But let me have one area of disagreement with the Secretary.
0.0	0.374244197208	So what we're going to have to start doing instead of, you know, picking on this group or this group, is we're going to have to have a major reduction in the regulatory influence that is going on.
0.0	0.470233983554	And we will join the rest of the other -- the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families.
0.0	0.366788627125	So, I think it's absolutely wrong policy for us to be even imagining we're going end up putting tens of thousands of American troops into Syria and Iraq to fight ISIS.
0.0	0.564948300862	President Obama's preparing to send $100 billion or more to the Ayatollah Khamenei.
0.0	0.494716603475	And so much of what we did -- to force competition, to use technology, to stand down the special interest groups -- can you imagine taking Medicaid from 10 to 2.5 percent?
0.0	0.458331710377	What my campaign is about is a political revolution -- millions of people standing up and saying, enough is enough.
0.0	0.428119499205	And it's especially significant that they are working with both Turkey and Greece in order to do this.
0.0	0.471234626882	He's the one that did Bergdahl.
0.0	0.452039858307	And there's all sorts of ways that can be done at the state, local and federal level to do that.
0.0	0.0	Thank you very much.
0.0	0.242923875041	I know it isn't something you just hope people will do and I've worked on that...
0.0	0.409437860864	It cannot be contained, it must be defeated.
0.0	0.615181091219	It costs me $3.
0.0	0.218946925902	Well, sure.
0.0	0.329941960165	... the best results, wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.457595973173	And what we did is try to move that department toward community policing, so that the police officers become part of the community and not, as we see, in some cities an oppressive force.
0.0	0.424757075179	I think a lot of the Libyans who had been forced out of their country by Gadhafi who came back to try to be part of a new government, believed they knew what to do and it turned out that they were no match for some of the militaristic forces inside that country.
0.0	0.0	You know why?
0.0	0.363403226235	And that's what this economy needs to -- that's what this debate needs to be about.
0.0	0.219101647079	Believe me.
0.0	0.201229817137	And, we come out here, and we do our thing.
0.0	0.521128632931	She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video.
0.0	0.297192516223	Caesar's -- excuse me -- Caesar's, the Rolls-Royce, as you know, is in bankruptcy.
0.0	0.462990738368	That is our government today.
0.0	0.386135667161	Not a very pleasant place to be.
0.0	0.433827709619	We have ISIS and al Qaeda attacking us.
0.0	0.497129208359	This is a country that is of, for and by the people.
0.0	0.234723693334	You know, I am by my nature impatient.
0.0	0.445305431379	The fact is what we need is someone on that stage who has been tested, who has been through it, who has made decisions, who has sit (ph) in the chair of consequence and can prosecute the case against Hillary Clinton on...
0.0	0.228885395471	Well, you know what?
0.0	0.417813837004	If you look at history, John, you will find that regime change -- whether it was in the early '50s in Iran, whether it was toppling Salvador Allende in Chile, whether it is overthrowing the government of Guatemala way back when -- these invasions, these toppling of governments, regime changes have unintended consequences.
0.0	0.500536957197	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.501758674189	And I'll tell you why, last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee, she admitted she had sent emails to her family saying, hey, this attack in Benghazi was caused by al Qaeda-like elements.
0.0	0.278101948165	They don't have a clue.
0.0	0.411710545508	They're very, very badly wounded.
0.0	0.299369805149	I do not see -- want to see one parent or loved one worrying about getting a call in the middle of the night.
0.0	0.491558210829	But I promise you, in the state of South Carolina, they do.
0.0	0.403140820101	But Iran is at the heart of most of the evil that is going on in the Middle East through their proxies.
0.0	0.420964516733	And we didn't put a single boot on the ground, and Gaddafi was deposed.
0.0	0.260064811295	So I want us to have a very tough screening process but I want that process to go forward.
0.0	0.294856560557	Let me (inaudible).
0.0	0.520906390039	And the world's financial system is on the verge of collapse.
0.0	0.535751144518	It'll produce enormous economic growth, and it eliminates every mandate, every subsidy, so there's no subsidies for oil and gas, no subsidies for anyone.
0.0	0.301978531926	We have tremendous people.
0.0	0.376518098371	Is there going to be any change in the House with new leadership?
0.0	0.376639094497	Well, Gwen and Judy, thank you very much for hosting this event.
0.0	0.326459846865	And what I'm talking about is not only the covert CIA intelligence, I'm also talking about diplomatic intelligence.
0.0	0.276569797446	DICKERSON: A question from Kathie Obradovich.
0.0	0.420394071358	And we have to do more to prevent the flood of foreign fighters that have gone to Syria, especially the ones with western passports, that come back.
0.0	0.409407477203	The most powerful intelligence agency in the world is going to tell us where we are, the most powerful military in the world is going to destroy them.
0.0	0.37089963997	You have a bigger problem with China.
0.0	0.44928360144	We were attacked in downtown Manhattan where Wall Street is.
0.0	0.446498745736	s entrenched problems head-on.
1.0	0.549865616334	Becky, if you want a 10 percent flat tax where the numbers add up, I rolled out my tax plan today, you can find it on line at tedcruz.org.
0.0	0.530312608406	This is what I think -- this is what many economists believe that one of the reasons that real unemployment in this country is 10 percent, one of the reasons that African American youth unemployment and underemployment is 51 percent is the average worker in America doesn't have any disposable income.
0.0	0.283155795312	I like how you stand up.
0.0	0.303419281153	And for good cause.
0.0	0.395613457171	The Shi'a-Sunni split.
0.0	0.31020928185	I would just say that...
1.0	0.483204190325	And they're tired of spending more money on education than any nation in the world per capita, than any nation in the world, and we are 26th in the world, 25 countries are better than us in education.
0.0	0.456774497616	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.0	So, I thank you very much for that.
0.0	0.40558108748	I do not believe that we have to destroy our economy in order to protect our environment.
0.0	0.379960587967	To talk about we're just gonna have a 10 percent tithe and that's how we're gonna fund the government?
0.0	0.42362807803	We can in fact create jobs and provide job security.
0.0	0.314760807497	I believe in it but we have to be smart and we have to use smart people to negotiate.
0.0	0.480663919567	There is one major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.0	Do it.
0.0	0.234737762128	It turns out we knew something was wrong.
0.0	0.500392566936	Number one, we do have more people who have access to health care.
0.0	0.399517493015	But we can give people better health care.
1.0	0.938048199414	Who denies that African-American youth unemployment, real, is over 50 percent.
0.0	0.377721197813	But the facts and the law here are really quite clear.
0.0	0.383611510651	It worked for Reagan and it works for our team in Ohio.
0.0	0.263082265163	I said, "I don't know."
0.0	0.1696183397	It's nice.
0.0	0.475009421903	My father came to this country from Poland at the age of 17 without a nickel in his pocket, which sparked my interest in the need for immigration reform because I know what it's like to be the son of an immigrant.
0.0	0.407110136092	It is not a barbed wire fence.
0.0	0.0	But look...
0.0	0.296089091974	Martha, thank you.
0.0	0.456457497063	Where the secretary and I have a very profound difference, in the last debate -- and I believe in her book -- very good book, by the way -- in her book and in this last debate, she talked about getting the approval or the support or the mentoring of Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.312413785751	This is an interesting point when you talk about immigration.
0.0	0.585074613081	As a result, eight credit upgrades; as a result, a top ten state for private sector job creation.
0.0	0.27829006433	Here's the truth.
0.0	0.636573370056	And now in Ohio, with the same formula, wages higher than the -- than the national average.
0.0	0.512739061903	We reported excessive force, discourtesy, use of lethal force.
0.0	0.187447920433	But I guess I'm supposed to come out great.
0.0	0.48620766987	We have a president of the United States that is undermining this country's security and expanding the role of...
1.0	0.517124134709	It allows President Obama to borrow unlimited amounts of money.
0.0	0.447407841216	And a rebuilt U.S. military is going to destroy these terrorists.
0.0	0.382507276888	I talked about Donald Trump from the standpoint of being an individual who was using his celebrity rather than his conservatism.
0.0	0.322869646778	Let's quit making it a problem for them.
0.0	0.264205255483	First off, we can do all the great speeches we want but you're not going to succeed unless there is a consensus.
0.0	0.285147440252	Go ahead.
0.0	0.446983500934	You come to back to this country and you have LAX, disaster.
0.0	0.347485658348	I can agree with you or not, but you can't have a question over your head.
0.0	0.263619942001	We had Boko Haram.
0.0	0.272426780156	Everybody thought it was a done deal.
0.0	0.539357609759	Next thing we do, pay equity for women workers.
0.0	0.371895420841	Now, on to your substantive question.
0.0	0.303723437332	I'd like to jump in.
0.0	0.478461772684	Now, you can say that's a tax on the middle class.
0.0	0.300326540128	I couldn't talk to anybody about it.
1.0	0.712688353336	Strong, powerful men, young and people are looking at that and they're saying what's going on?
0.0	0.295422520786	And said, well, she said you were angry and I said to myself, huh, she's right.
0.0	0.312425302775	You want to make the Veterans Administration do a better job, give them -- give veterans choices and you'll get a much better result.
0.0	0.495648201517	And I am the one true fiscal conservative who will look at all spending.
0.0	0.519168821817	What this campaign is not only about electing someone who has the most progressive agenda, it is about bringing tens of millions of people together to demand that we have a government that represents all of us and not just the 1 percent, who today have so much economic and political power.
0.0	0.291942408372	So I think, yeah, regime change is easy, getting rid of dictators is easy.
0.0	0.295163502118	Are they going to stand with us against this kind of jihadi radicalism or not?
0.0	0.443914349762	It was good for the economy and it was a way to rebuke the terrorists who had attacked our country.
0.0	0.31020928185	Could I just say -- just say this...
0.0	0.346561313168	We'll be filing it right on time.
0.0	0.308085345352	I think after 11 hours, that's pretty clear, yes.
0.0	0.373973090499	We can't afford another four years of that.
0.0	0.563614779749	Before this, I was a very successful person as a developer and as a businessman.
0.0	0.305452861868	So I put all of this together, again, on my website and I've gotten such a good response.
0.0	0.419535672129	Look, we have waiting lists for veterans that are -- that are leaving because of the sequester where we're gutting the military.
0.0	0.359350930076	But we need an independent investigation, and I hope Secretary Clinton will agree with me for the need of that.
1.0	0.762442216467	Well, Marco has been floating this attack for a few weeks now, but the problem is, the business flat tax in my proposal is not a vat.
0.0	0.386148408405	But our goal is, in fact, to try over a period of time to, in fact, deal with our enemies, not just ignore that reality.
0.0	0.434830718817	You have to lead.
0.0	0.369927293944	And, it was made for we the people, we are the ones who decide who we are, and we should never give away the values and principles that made America into a great nation for the sake of political correctness.
1.0	0.427978900646	They cite Obamacare.
0.0	0.49007464093	This is a group of people that burns people in cages, that is conducting genocide against Christians and Yazidis and others in the region.
0.0	0.449898950037	And the one thing is that when you run, you have to announce and certify to all sorts of governmental authorities your net worth.
0.0	0.398586121969	So, in terms of refugees, I believe that the United States has the moral responsibility with Europe, with Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia to make sure that when people leave countries like Afghanistan and Syria with nothing more than the clothing on their back that, of course, we reach out.
0.0	0.181151904003	But before you do that, you've got to think about what happens the day after.
0.0	0.32976046547	They can do business with Iran, or they can do business with America, and I am very confident they're going to choose America before they choose the Iranian economy.
0.0	0.351034557509	Maria, let me clear something up here.
0.0	0.331850806982	He's an entertaining guy.
0.0	0.328618453091	You see, because if you really want to get to a balanced budget, you need to reduce your expenses and you need to grow your economy.
0.0	0.357141392204	If you're a Washington lobbyist, if you make your money in and around Washington, things are doing great.
0.0	0.386598214164	In fact, that's part of the problem.
0.0	0.573547486702	We have 30,000 fewer state bureaucrats than the day I took office.
0.0	0.630542099891	Next thing that we do, real unemployment -- official unemployment, 5 percent, real employment 10 percent, youth unemployment, off the charts.
0.0	0.461602421001	And every law enforcement should carry the antidote to overdose, Naloxone, so that they can save lives that are on the brink of expiring.
0.0	0.204136543364	And it has been amazing to me.
0.0	0.33637864655	I was a banker and I was proud of it.
0.0	0.41150373309	She's an American citizen.
0.0	0.293901605225	Nobody can solve it like me.
0.0	0.271491102975	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.38666368435	Well, David, I think this is one of the most important challenges facing not just our next president but our country.
0.0	0.422014793834	But that's not an accurate description of the plan.
0.0	0.384238103432	So we have a lot of work to do in this campaign to make it clear where we stand in the Democratic Party, what we will do for our country, and I look forward to this evening's discussion of real issues that face the American people.
0.0	0.557330832027	You can't get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year.
0.0	0.470871664586	Nobody wants to watch three and a half, or three hours.
1.0	0.770579589852	He voted in favor of regime change with Libya, voted in favor of the Security Council being an active participate in setting the parameters for what we would do, which of course we followed through on.
0.0	0.362385859534	But what's wrong is your premise in the question.
0.0	0.429902860931	Big and powerful use big and powerful government to their advantage.
0.0	0.408998764764	And by the way, it's not just on immigration, you used to support TPA, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.365388946739	Not to contain them, but to defeat them.

0.0	0.491533864683	You know, these plans would put us trillions and trillions of dollars in debt.
0.0	0.25454799731	We've got a president who instead says, we're going to change hearts and minds.
0.0	0.337905808885	You know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money.
0.0	0.339211705195	Because I think if you only think about the coalition abroad you're missing the main point, which is we need a coalition here at home.
0.0	0.445703501297	In fact, if more border security and these -- and more and more deportations were going to bring our Republican brothers and sisters to the table, it would have happened long ago.
0.0	0.412325868555	Look, the conservative message is economic growth and along with economic growth goes opportunity for everybody in America.
0.0	0.477995390815	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.556532442009	I'm one of the 77 percent.

0.0	0.515741271473	They see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on Wall Street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all.
0.0	0.28381620071	Yes, let's tell the truth, Martin.
0.0	0.413765267973	Our role in the world is not to roam the globe looking for new dictators to topple.
0.0	0.402930397963	You're an American, as is everybody else on this stage, and I would suggest we focus on who's best prepared to be commander- in-chief, because that's the most important question facing the country.
0.0	0.268749983404	You learn to create feedback mechanisms.
0.0	0.494016649452	To the 1 percent who have been fighting this war for over a decade, I'd try my best to be a commander-in-chief worthy of your sacrifice.
0.0	0.432736525662	We need somebody who can balance budgets, cut taxes...
0.0	0.35032245704	And for the sake of me, I can't figure out which one is which.

0.0	0.434978758081	I stood on the stage and watched Marco in rather indignantly, look at Governor Bush and say, someone told you that because we're running for the same office, that criticizing me will get you to that office.
0.0	0.550655492249	Yes, I do believe that we must end corporate loopholes, such that major corporations year after year pay virtually zero in federal income tax, because they're stashing the money in the Cayman Islands.

0.0	0.435140640997	Who denies that it is crazy to allow people to own guns who are criminals or are mentally unstable?
0.0	0.482303574829	There were parts of that bill which agree with parts -- I disagree.
0.0	0.457218516953	And, I'll note finally, Chris, there is a reason that Iowa's Congressman Steve King, perhaps the fiercest defender of farmers in this state, is sharing my campaign.

0.0	0.561057095184	I'm running for president because our economy is rigged because working people are working longer hours for lower wages and almost all of new wealth and income being created is going to the top one percent.
0.0	0.464947089759	There's mergers that are happening in every aspect of our country that is bad for competition and it's bad for -- for upward mobility of wages.
0.0	0.380894773117	And by the way, as important as those two phone calls are, they are also very important because they say this.
0.0	0.529663773819	We ought to give them a little bit of a liability release so that they share data amongst themselves and share data with the federal government, they're not fearful of a lawsuit.
0.0	0.335604324182	But you ought to acknowledge the government doesn't do a very good job at it.

0.0	0.369757159443	We need to bring together our European and our Sunni Arab allies, and we need to develop a strategy together to take on ISIS every place that it is around the world, so that together, all of us can take ISIS out, destroy it, and then move on to come back to our country, protect our homeland security and make sure that the American people are safe.
0.0	0.538629384927	Well, as you know, I'm a former elected prosecutor, a former elected attorney general, trained at the University of Virginia in constitutional law, and I don't believe in litmus tests except this.
0.0	0.262664779215	I do not think we should promise or even look toward normalizing relations because we have a lot of other business to get done with Iran.

0.0	0.335018950401	Absolutely, we need to defund Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.471678569119	Our enduring symbol is not the barbed wire fence, it is the Statue of Liberty.

0.0	0.446377654324	Rand's amendment was not the right way to do it.
0.0	0.570131248006	Because of all the federal mandates and federal laws, it was too expensive.
0.0	0.247808836177	All right.
0.0	0.502217118064	One as a marine officer in Iraq, one as an army officer in Afghanistan.
0.0	0.409799326245	I am advocating...
0.0	0.478802418157	But we have to restore policing that will actually protect the communities that police officers are sworn to protect.
0.0	0.553615697736	And in terms of seniors, there are millions of seniors -- and I've talked to them in my state of Vermont and all over this country -- who are trying to get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year Social Security.
0.0	0.47299885595	If you had the court reverse Roe v. Wade, it would become a state issue once again.

0.0	0.455092791099	I may not be your dream candidate just yet, but I can assure you I am Hillary Clinton's worst nightmare.
0.0	0.255673432631	We're against your policies.
0.0	0.408320000962	But you know what, you can make a middle class wage, you have decent health care, decent benefits.
0.0	0.503279449596	It enables us to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	0.366705876237	I will continue to have tremendous admiration and respect for Governor Bush.
0.0	0.267386318558	(LAUGHTER) I'll tell you what.
0.0	0.201155621533	I think -- I'm not going to say that everybody is in agreement.
0.0	0.636564368497	After that you pay 10 percent as a flat tax going up.
0.0	0.272014440546	In fact, I'd love him to leave early and play, that would be a very good thing.
0.0	0.38626083607	This is a complicated issue.
0.0	0.440273553002	This election is not only about electing a president.
0.0	0.432742699695	So we always have to balance liberty and security, privacy and safety, but I know that law enforcement needs the tools to keep us safe.
0.0	0.224256172102	They'll all come back.
0.0	0.407299560598	Well, this is what I would say, and the Congressman was right.
0.0	0.41032390345	Why aren't we talking about -- instead of cutting benefits for old people, cutting benefits for sick people -- why don't we say, "let's cure the four big cost-driving diseases...
0.0	0.0	No, you weren't.
0.0	0.215672040475	And it's something that can be done, and I get questioned about that.
0.0	0.224975708513	That's kind of a no-brainer.
0.0	0.446988103832	You have to reform Social Security, and the simple way to do it is to make sure that the wealthiest don't receive the same benefits as people that are lower-income.
0.0	0.219101647079	That is what I believe.
0.0	0.448600337518	You know, we had this incident before, Secretary, with your famous e-mails.
0.0	0.420587372308	These attack ads are going to be part of life.
0.0	0.285072912477	I gotta do it, Dad.
0.0	0.297096814586	They have a responsibility, as well.
0.0	0.300184551056	I find -- I mean, it's just a very different, you know, historical perspective here.
1.0	0.535163481498	I have looked at -- I have looked at the legislation that Senator Sanders has proposed, and basically, he does eliminate the Affordable Care Act, eliminates private insurance, eliminates Medicare, eliminates Medicaid, Tricare, children's health insurance program -- puts it all together in a big program which he then hands over to the states to administer.
0.0	0.463097520607	Well, first of all, I'm 7 and 0 in my fantasy league.
0.0	0.301628661974	We get a traitor.
0.0	0.545383169358	Well, first, I was critical of the Senators not giving the authorization for the use of military force.
0.0	0.200909244383	Hey look, he never had a chance.
0.0	0.383210795865	You see, folks, this is how socialism starts.
0.0	0.499272362646	Yes, I thought about running four years ago.
0.0	0.485671843175	Watching this broadcast tonight are millions of people that are living paycheck to paycheck.
1.0	0.90155397015	And then we decided we could bring $14 billion of our money -- I mean, Washington doesn't have any money.
0.0	0.396805006119	We need a leader who will lead the resurgence of this great nation and unlock its potential once again.
0.0	0.272924587447	This issue is not about that anymore.
0.0	0.476592081949	...incentives for people to keep people healthy, rather than giving the incentives to treat them when they're sick?
1.0	0.401517838304	We stuck to the fact that Americans are tired of Washington corporate interests and Democrats who are interested in just politics and power and they're looking for someone who's going to fight for them; looking for someone who's going to grow manufacturing sector of our economy, so those 74 percent of Americans who don't have a college degree have a chance to rise again.
0.0	0.270618399754	It's a joke.
0.0	0.453686189274	And for the sake of our economy, they must -- the major banks must be broken up.
0.0	0.0	That's what it is.
0.0	0.51628678486	When millions of Americans rose up against Obamacare, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.23004805254	And I'll tell you what I'm worried about -- I'm worried about money.
0.0	0.420489478593	If even in Paris, if they had guns on the other side, going in the opposite direction, you wouldn't have 130 people plus dead.
0.0	0.471653812358	Until we have a president of the United States that gets up every day and goes to the Oval Office with the intent purpose of securing that border, and there's not anybody on either one of these stages that has the experience of dealing with this as I have for over 14 years with that 1200-mile border.
0.0	0.461329957474	... that's what you say in a primary.
0.0	0.435663476697	She led that effort.
0.0	0.389892007771	But the issue for us is to have a Congress that stands up and says not only no, but "Hell no" to this money going to a regime that is going to use it for terror, Susan Rice has said that, and we need to stand up and strongly and clearly tell the ayatollah that -- whoever the next president of the United States is going to be, and I'll promise you, if it's me, the first thing that I will do is tear up that agreement with Iran.
0.0	0.160361868401	Think of it.
0.0	0.529589111503	Barack Obama got his massive tax increase, and there was no spending cuts.
0.0	0.417113835061	If you can encrypt messages, ISIS can, over these platforms, and we have no ability to have a cooperative relationship --
0.0	0.255243215598	Yes, I agree.
0.0	0.397439895744	I mean the fact is, is that they need to put the pressure on and frankly we need to intercepts ships coming out of North Korea so they don't proliferate all these dangerous materials.
0.0	0.0	That's it.
0.0	0.318799168355	The American people have been told for 30 years they're going to enforce the border, they're going to build a wall and it never gets built and it never happens.
0.0	0.485923393217	You have all of these disastrous airports.
0.0	0.505007258478	I sent a boat over and they actually sent it back.
0.0	0.0	They didn't do that.
0.0	0.365054174091	The Democrats can't even come up with one.
0.0	0.0	No.
0.0	0.427229039415	We have to do the best possible job of sharing intelligence and information.
0.0	0.408095770172	You know I understand why Donald made the comments he did and I understand why Americans are feeling frustrated and scared and angry when we have a president who refuses to acknowledge the threat we face and even worse, who acts as an apologist for radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.319403848684	We're giving young people and working people hope that real change can take place in America.
0.0	0.514857213231	My oldest daughter's a teacher.

0.0	0.503870837202	She actually ran against one of my friends and our head of public safety.
0.0	0.426346451377	We need a fighter for this country again.
0.0	0.478743334394	Let's quit blaming the people on Social Security.
0.0	0.395607658636	They are worried to death about the future of their kids.

0.0	0.467423411333	Have been ever since I was in the Senate.
0.0	0.659893291663	Real inflation accounted for wages has declined precipitously over the years.
0.0	0.238500130563	I'm going to keep making sure that everything I've done, everything that I stand for is going to be well known.
0.0	0.440950586591	And our focus has got to be on intelligence, increased manpower, fighting internationally targets.
0.0	0.445398421541	You cannot grant amnesty.
0.0	0.427303461797	China, you go there now, roads, bridges, schools, you never saw anything like it.
0.0	0.453094153461	We shouldn't have the war fighters have their arms tied behind their back as President Obama wanted to do, but they had a chance to show support and it wasn't popular at the time.
0.0	0.556459321228	And number three, we should work to de-link health insurance from employment so if you lose your job, your health insurance goes with you and it is personal, portable and affordable.
0.0	0.451256808472	I agree, we need better -- we need to rein in the over- prescribing, but I have put forward on my -- in my plan a $12 billion federal investment.
1.0	0.435997192795	I have voted time and again to -- for -- for the background check, and I want to see it improved and expanded.
0.0	0.0	Yes.
0.0	0.499428887561	We got it done in my state by leading with principal and that's what we need to do as a party for comprehensive gun safety.
0.0	0.350569013907	So if you happen to be right, you could get the top job at the end of the day.
0.0	0.390466941265	... and I know Bernie, and I can promise you he's not going to be president of the United States.
0.0	0.434063524909	You know, the mother of the young man with his friends in the car who was playing loud music and, you know, some older white man pulled out a gun and shot him because they wouldn't turn the radio down.
0.0	0.468083033786	We hear all this discussion about well, I would do this, or I would do that, when the fact is, the border is still porous.
0.0	0.210322495149	I think he'll be a great cheerleader for the country.
1.0	0.890654613003	I lost that election by three percentage points.
0.0	0.25204577141	Let me say this.
0.0	0.453509149983	Obama broke every rule of negotiation.
0.0	0.434941778897	And clearly, what we need to do is get a group of experts together, including people from other countries, some of our friends from Israel, who have had experience screening these people and come up with new guidelines for immigration, and for visas, for people who are coming into this country.
0.0	0.358887379352	No, I think the idea was that president -- then-Senator Obama was wrong for suggesting that it is a good idea to talk to your opponents.
0.0	0.183806509888	And you can go get it at jeb2016.com.
0.0	0.38340166159	I want to ask the people of the audience.
0.0	0.355164649076	Recognize that the caliphate is what gives them the legitimacy to go out on a jihadist mission, so we need to take that away from them.
0.0	0.0	What are we doing?
0.0	0.327244261115	But in two seconds, they give me whatever I wanted.
0.0	0.44125574081	I introduced...
0.0	0.4966761217	Since, you know, the end of the last Clinton administration when incomes did go up for everybody.
0.0	0.443649134564	Well, first let me address the tax issue because it's related to the entitlement issue and I want to thank you for holding a substantive debates where we can have debates about these key issues on taxes.
0.0	0.257485283855	They didn't know the air-conditioner didn't work.
0.0	0.314207694681	But they can't get along.
0.0	0.402052483368	Well first of all, I think it's important that when we're running for the highest office in the land that we recognize that we're living in dangerous times and we have to be serious about it, that our words have consequences.
0.0	0.337577535083	Your name wasn't mentioned, Ted.
0.0	0.496288193516	Marco stood today, standing on this stage Marco supports legalization and citizenship for 12 million illegals.
0.0	0.308411653293	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.404100194088	I made it the old-fashioned way.
0.0	0.300862621042	So I don't think you can paint with a broad brush.
0.0	0.399440243774	That can be done without profiling people.
0.0	0.503375109956	So what we do, though, is, if there is somebody who is price- gouging, we have laws for prosecutors to take that on.
0.0	0.378431383454	It was a back sacrifice, and I have to hand it to Ben.
0.0	0.405909397518	We ought to have politicians who not only have government experience but know how the CEOs and the job creators work.
0.0	0.411974829769	Such a nasty -- such a nasty question, but thank you, Governor.
