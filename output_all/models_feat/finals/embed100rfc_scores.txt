1.0	0.239709755817	That's exactly what the Republican establishment says too.
0.0	0.372620387942	And that's why I've been clear, when I am the president of the United States of America, we don't know who you are, and we don't know why you're trying to come to the United States, you are not going to get in, because the radical threat that we now face from ISIS is extraordinary and unprecedented...
0.0	0.11532828642	I agree with my colleagues.
0.0	0.0599640396104	Think about it.

0.0	0.47673431308	Mine gives every American a simple, flat tax of 10 percent.
0.0	0.333183769651	But I will certainly turn to him as prior presidents have for special missions, for advice, and in particular, how we're going to get the economy working again for everybody, which he knows a little bit about.
0.0	0.0553047784825	And guess what?
0.0	0.33421287376	Guns, in and of themselves, in my opinion, will not make Americans safer.
0.0	0.288584128895	But we need to understand that American Muslims are on the front line of our defense.
0.0	0.236302361183	We eliminate the payroll tax, we eliminate the Obamacare taxes.
0.0	0.186410235516	I think on Article V of NATO, we would definitely protect all of our allies.
0.0	0.210181397749	Our enduring symbol is not the barbed wire fence, it is the Statue of Liberty.
0.0	0.363103996806	And that's only the beginning of the failures that they have committed, not only in the Middle East, but all over the world, including Russia and China.
0.0	0.300038174527	And that's why, as president, I will look at communities that need special help and try to deliver that.
0.0	0.341622092114	That is very different than talking about specific action for regime change, which I did not support.
0.0	0.442536798273	I've supported a variety of solutions, both state as well as federal.
0.0	0.351802100253	But, I said, "This is going to be an election that's based on competence, because people are tired of these nice people.
0.0	0.234931814312	I would just say that...
0.0	0.392294011739	Why, for the life of me, I do not understand why did we stop doing vocational education in America, people that can work with their hands; people you can train to do this work while they're still in high school so they can graduate ready to go work.
0.0	0.429903504728	I have a proven record of success, 32 years in business, and 8 years as Governor of the state of Florida.

0.0	0.0153948453707	About Medicare?
0.0	0.315210509103	It's very important we focus on the threats we face today, and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in.
0.0	0.369170137219	Yeah, again, as I said, we're raising a family in the 21st century and it's one of the reasons why my tax plan is a pro- family tax plan.
0.0	0.379213802652	And the fact of the matter is that the more fully people participate, the more our workers earn, the more they will spend, the more our economy will grow.
0.0	0.257411922807	I don't think they dropped all the amendments into a hat and picked them out of a hat.
0.0	0.219672828952	We were the first in the family.
0.0	0.351240726874	But those kinds of personal assessments and charges are ones that I find particularly troubling.
0.0	0.156126483234	That's a wonderful business model.
0.0	0.214375539076	So the indignation that you carry on, some of the stuff, you have to also own then.
0.0	0.247851091768	It will be a way of life.
0.0	0.261604873944	They went to the DNC quietly.
0.0	0.378262725392	And I stood alongside Jeff Sessions and Steve King, and we led the fight against amnesty.
0.0	0.1620535988	Let's do more -- let's do more than reverse the immunity.
0.0	0.329594074607	It comes from the right, from the left, from people on all sides of the political spectrum.
0.0	0.158300116556	Let me be clear.
0.0	0.259622994011	Well, thank you very much for hosting this debate, and let me applaud my colleagues up here.
0.0	0.25336245248	We got nuclear weapons that are obsolete.
0.0	0.334268558337	No, it would have to go through the Congress, and I know the White House has actually been working with members of Congress.
0.0	0.179007667775	I think we're missing the point here.
0.0	0.249650058921	Rebuild the country's infrastructure.
0.0	0.112488052703	They don't know what they're doing."
0.0	0.283454398224	My Muslim friends, some, said, "thank you very much; we'll get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.386709524847	You know, all of my life, I've heard that a truly successful person, a really, really successful person and even modestly successful cannot run for public office.
0.0	0.195955202699	And we need someone who will take on Hillary Clinton in November.
0.0	0.247325052685	The Republican Party is blessed to have 11 good candidates, (inaudible) 10 good candidates.
0.0	0.316803996713	So I hope and pray and cannot wait until this state and others give me an opportunity to serve this party as its nominee because I will defeat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.197276263787	Professional politician that can't be trusted.
0.0	0.377028607605	You know, you go to the internet, you start reading an article and you go to the comments section -- you cannot go five comments down before people are calling each all manner of names.
0.0	0.085920970374	Yes.
0.0	0.278408967588	Of course, we're going to be a nation of immigrants.
0.0	0.376387332809	Yes, we could get rid of Assad tomorrow, but that would create another political vacuum that would benefit ISIS.
0.0	0.353099480231	We don't represent Wall Street, we don't represent the billionaire class, so it ends up I'm the only candidate up here of the many candidates who has no Super PAC.
0.0	0.426508453293	Just as morale in the military has plummeted in the last seven, so it had then.
0.0	0.322246624603	We need a leader that wrote "The Art of the Deal."
0.0	0.405870057709	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.309939423836	They recognize that people's actions don't always match their words.
0.0	0.390325024702	So I think, at a time when so many of our kids are desperately looking for constructive activity, where too many of our kids are hanging around on street corners, potentially getting into trouble, I think we need a forceful advocate for the children, for teenagers, for the little children, to deal with the dysfunctional child care system, and I think my wife would do a great job in helping me accomplish those goals.
0.0	0.528880169894	When I left the workforce, New York State had been reduced by over 15 percent.
0.0	0.274402198163	It would not necessitate us raising any taxes.
0.0	0.374044014131	Then you have to get rid of Larry Kudlow, who sits on your panel, who's a great guy, who came out the other day and said, I love Trump's tax plan.
0.0	0.0145312892301	It's not constitutional.
0.0	0.293927341082	But just as importantly, and I agree with what John said.
0.0	0.0238978152247	Excuse me.
0.0	0.144244803838	That I can tell you.
0.0	0.433629556593	You think about it -- this is the president who said, along with his secretary of state -- drew a red line in Syria, said, if Assad uses chemical weapons against his people, that we're going to attack.
0.0	0.378582977769	And you don't go tell Muslim nations you want them to be part of a coalition when you have a leading candidate for president of the United States who insults their religion.
0.0	0.093969952979	She should not feel uncomfortable about her citizenship.
0.0	0.395164029115	Because when government gets big and powerful, the big feel like they need to get even bigger to deal with all that power, and meanwhile, the small and the powerless -- in this case, 1,590 community banks -- go out of business.
0.0	0.199579292588	I do not believe in unilateral American action.
0.0	0.220671650375	People who we should be welcoming and working with.
0.0	0.186083356835	And it's available on paperback, if you're interested in buying my book.
0.0	0.338477118225	I honored my commitments, and as president, I will honor every commitment that I make to the men and women of this country.
0.0	0.399572775133	I want to find out why those two young people -- those two horrible young people in California when they shot the 14 people, killed them -- people they knew, people that held the wedding reception for them.
0.0	0.123962285945	The Turks are being threatened.
0.0	0.376084291132	And now many of these candidates want to cut it.
0.0	0.394383116872	So we have a lot of work to do in this campaign to make it clear where we stand in the Democratic Party, what we will do for our country, and I look forward to this evening's discussion of real issues that face the American people.
0.0	0.156103779622	But that's not an accurate description of the plan.
0.0	0.160785697204	They thought something was wrong.
0.0	0.253439417557	If you make your president, I'm going to put the country ahead of the party.
0.0	0.268119929123	We owned a liquor store, restaurant, bar and we lived in the back.
0.0	0.237223206598	Everybody got out -- and they kept our equipment.
1.0	0.982113518272	So states over a period of decades have put their money elsewhere; into prisons, into highways, into things other than higher education.
0.0	0.0877566841801	Play by the rules.
0.0	0.0870585283766	Look at what's happening with the Republicans.
0.0	0.0890843195523	How are we going to do this?
0.0	0.655890543212	But...
0.0	0.265741898117	I talked about Donald Trump from the standpoint of being an individual who was using his celebrity rather than his conservatism.
0.0	0.277120452329	And places like Seattle, like Los Angeles, like New York City, they can go higher.
0.0	0.141962764057	And I think this is an important question.
0.0	0.340943906017	I think there's a sense in this country today that somehow our best days are behind us.
0.0	0.206489525252	There is a pretty excruciating process that refugees go through.
0.0	0.268341793606	... on the issue of citizenship, Donald, I'm not going to use your mother's birth against you.
0.0	0.477926012434	If you are now hit on a 60 percent tax on both your income and on the wages you pay your employees, where are you going to get that money from?
0.0	0.00430451372677	Thank you.
0.0	0.405903374605	We have so much natural gas now, and we can liquify it, and we can transfer it across the sea so we can make Europe dependent on us instead of Putin -- put him back in his little box where he belongs.
0.0	0.0613117905321	I came as a reformer.
0.0	0.304272851108	I'm not -- my campaign is going to be about the future of America, it's not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage.
0.0	0.335869490811	You know, the Security Council finally got around to adopting a resolution.
0.0	0.434003323829	Well, I'll tell you something: you can take everything from the top 1 percent, and you apply it to our fiscal gap, and you won't even make a dent in it.
0.0	0.117505193371	We'll go to the Congress.
0.0	0.149422102429	Let me say this.
0.0	0.295747045853	And I believe that the best way to do that is to be aggressive, to be principled, but to have the goal of trying to improve relations.
0.0	0.43590345712	So when they -- be found against that country that's selling products in here lower than the cost of what it takes to produce them, then what do we tell the worker?
0.0	0.317113143065	And I'll add in the third, we had a great financial statement.
0.0	0.264614619435	Which is what we're gonna get if we elect a big government liberal like Hillary Clinton to the White House.
0.0	0.0467540629684	And that is what we have done in Ohio.
0.0	0.177277639076	Those are the things we brought, and we were able to get things done.
0.0	0.301688735224	I think maybe my greatest weakness is that I trust people too much.
0.0	0.384448924937	Well, I was pleased that NATO announced just this week that they're going to start doing patrols in the Mediterranean, in the Aegean, to try to interdict the smugglers, to try to prevent the kind of tragedies that we have seen all too often, also to try to prevent more refugees from coming to the European Union.
0.0	0.364696595465	The Democrats' answer to everything is more government control over wages, and more empowering trial lawyers to file lawsuits.
0.0	0.180648962863	See, in Ohio, we've had some controversial decisions.
0.0	0.155764421828	They built the great wall of China.

0.0	0.298535584097	I have talked to some of the young kids with tears rolling down their cheeks, are scared to death that today they may or their parents may be deported.
0.0	0.358857955814	If it had gone right, believe me, she would have been running around to be able to take credit for it.
0.0	0.467030940323	Bottom line is a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people, if Congress doesn't do the right thing, we use the executive orders of the president.
0.0	0.145456145719	they expect to get something.
0.0	0.374495494606	So if Ms. Davis wanted to step aside and get rid of her ability to be able to do that, there should be someone else in that office who it didn't violate their conscience so they could follow the law of the state of Kentucky.
0.0	0.0854345135185	He has gone to China.
0.0	0.195968009935	I know how hard it is to build coalitions.
0.0	0.320944019984	Let me just add one thing about ISIS over there.
0.0	0.17838145992	That's fair game but that's where I'm going to focus.
0.0	0.0400440035478	This is the election...
0.0	0.390449644453	If i were the president of the United States, I would go and look at every executive order that exists right now and determine which ones want to be voided, because the president shouldn't be legislating: not through that vehicle or any other.
0.0	0.411051100567	The agreement on humanitarian relief now needs to be implemented, because there are enclaves that are literally filled with starving people throughout Syria.
0.0	0.0954408308301	It was an excruciating experience.
0.0	0.225937864544	You've got to bring people together.
0.0	0.306914701816	I want to see us do away with the gun show loophole.
0.0	0.338251432399	But I have no argument with anyone making up her mind about who to support.
0.0	0.373139556808	In this particular moment of serious crises, saying to the American people don't give up on the political process.
0.0	0.00430451372677	Thank you.
0.0	0.143512715791	I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King.
0.0	0.0326981719396	HEMMER: Wow.
0.0	0.0675486812578	That's not true.
0.0	0.4206805316	It is a unique nation in all of human history and on the face of the planet, because here, our founders believed that everyone has a right to fulfill their potential and that that right --they called it life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness -- comes from God and cannot be taken away by government.
0.0	0.45385602796	And now we have to accept 2 percent, the new normal for economic growth.
0.0	0.290988845204	I am, but people are upset, and they're upset for a reason about the future of this country.
0.0	0.655890543212	It was against Assad.
0.0	0.20982732668	If I have a weakness, it's that I try to live by the rules.
0.0	0.239482597295	How are they going to beat ISIS?
0.0	0.129183621076	They've advertised that.
0.0	0.0641666477158	Go to YouTube.
0.0	0.0906878714301	And, here's the difference between me and Hillary Clinton.
1.0	0.319443013811	I've used it three times, maybe four times.
0.0	0.334738113964	If the right person asked them, they'd pay a fortune.
0.0	0.386987796421	And, yes, people we may disagree with on a number of things may have some insight, may have some relationships that are important for the president to understand in order to best protect the United States.
0.0	0.0109382915112	We haven't.
0.0	0.392009220687	No, I said, " I would use -- " they were asking me what to do about North Korea.
0.0	0.384571127324	And my reading of the law and the Constitution convinces me that the President has the authority that he is attempting to exercise with respect to dreamers and their parents, because I think all of us on this stage agree that we need comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.20856420932	I believe in the PTT because it's important those countries in Asia are interfacing against China.
0.0	0.278824590249	They know that this country is not respected around the world anymore.
0.0	0.107131469486	I was a governor during the 9/11 attack.
0.0	0.437514329234	And it costs, with dynamic scoring, less than a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.33867936292	(LAUGHTER) Now that we've gotten the Donald Trump portion out of the way...
0.0	0.253808011589	We need sound money.
0.0	0.0609525002679	It won't happen.
0.0	0.356289720366	It's all about getting people to listen to one another's problems.
0.0	0.25177545684	Starting with our children and moving forward.
0.0	0.142637822024	Let me tell you what I think we have got to do.
0.0	0.390564832696	That very first time they show up with a near miss, we should be intervening there.
0.0	0.278967343101	Imagine -- imagine -- if a politician were held to that standard of account.
0.0	0.456550627528	Not armies massively marching on each other and air forces, but now we have dirty bombs and we have cyber attacks and we have people who will be attacking our electrical grid.
0.0	0.268527047765	But I feel that the gun-free zones and, you know, when you say that, that's target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill. That's target.
0.0	0.371209193854	But the process should move forward while we are also taking on ISIS, putting together the kind of strategy that I've advocated for, and making sure that the vetting and the screening is as tough as possible.
0.0	0.365003084894	I would hope that we could all agree that we are sick and tired of seeing videos on television of unarmed people, often African-Americans, shot by police officers.
0.0	0.231321140877	And on this issue of the Medicare in particular, it's important because they're going to demagogue what we're saying here tonight.
0.0	0.0869059478512	Right.
0.0	0.409000089197	... saying, no middle class tax raises.
0.0	0.307049028671	Well, I was a conservative governor of Virginia, I governed that way, and that's my track record.
0.0	0.456845133584	It basically gave the gun lobby even more power to intimidate legislators, not just in Washington but across the country.
0.0	0.244304965335	She is not qualified to be President of the United States.
0.0	0.395126972983	In fact, if you remember, 50, 60 years ago, the University of California, City University of New York were virtually tuition-free.
0.0	0.197842170094	So -- you know, you shouldn't misrepresent how well you're doing with the polls.
0.0	0.166927873024	Ben Carson, can you do math?
0.0	0.232755276002	KELLY: Go ahead, Governor Christie.
0.0	0.300249421882	And I would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country.
0.0	0.383909566094	It was the first time we did it since man walked on the moon.
0.0	0.287750588151	Last point.
0.0	0.0989269737493	I totally get that.
0.0	0.452321289364	And what you'll find is that I led -- helped lead the effort as a member of the House financial committee against Alan Greenspan, against a guy named Bill Clinton, maybe you know him, maybe you don't.
0.0	0.0970175015544	Do we still have values and principles?
0.0	0.267724879417	John, I -- if I -- a lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.281210853581	We need a nominee who is going to throw every punch, not pull punches, and someone who cannot stumble before he even gets into the ring.
0.0	0.154270461523	When do we beat Mexico at the border?
0.0	0.256107453246	I'm going to be introducing a plan which I call the 2020 Perfect Vision for America.
0.0	0.283936017944	Yes, and it was the same one that President Obama made.
0.0	0.162110964458	But they can't get along.
0.0	0.369902721878	She worked -- and many of us supported you -- in trying to rebuild that devastation.
0.0	0.438799486177	Every war you can imaging, we have people at each other's throat and our strength is actually in our unity.
0.0	0.199872121764	Let me just -- let me respond.
0.0	0.294508992757	You know where their United States headquarters is located?
0.0	0.420771330834	We will -- when I am president of the United States, on my first day in office, we are canceling the deal with Iran, and nations will have to make a choice.
0.0	0.0610475101723	We can do that in Washington.
0.0	0.0179458472762	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.310424012457	Just like Martin, I met with a group of Muslim-Americans this past week to hear from them about what they're doing to try to stop radicalization.
0.0	0.278963794939	He said, "Yeah, they do it all the time with other people."
0.0	0.255228950671	The secretary is right: Our people are fearful.
0.0	0.137913890312	The millionaires and billionaires are doing great under Obama.
0.0	0.202906408209	I respectfully disagree with Senator Sander's approach.
0.0	0.405870057709	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.328040582233	Ours was intended to be a citizen government.
0.0	0.309284381475	And the world's financial system is on the verge of collapse.
0.0	0.401619873402	Because they know that Hillary Clinton will never be prosecuted by this justice department, and they're going to want to put a former federal prosecutor on the stage to prosecute her next September.
0.0	0.330599717043	How can you run for the Republican nomination and be for single- payer health care?
0.0	0.258220549844	But to destroy ISIS, it is necessary.
0.0	0.444184056723	In my administration, we will help to make sure we bring people together in the Middle East, and we will fight ISIS and defeat them.
0.0	0.128525551732	And Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being the commander-in-chief of the United States.
0.0	0.111877749808	Marco Rubio, why don't you resign?
1.0	0.0696443315704	They're rapists.
1.0	0.169243801738	The Oregon study showed this.
0.0	0.386581973286	We can in fact create jobs and provide job security.
0.0	0.140276763121	Let me respond to...
0.0	0.233041313007	And so I think really that vote is going to stay in the Paul household.
1.0	0.972415022349	That's wrong.
0.0	0.358291896421	But getting back to Martha's question about how we end dependency, do we have to have a cultural change?
0.0	0.29722620443	And that's why we have to use Carl (ph) and we have to use our great businesspeople and not political hacks to negotiate with these guys.
0.0	0.24092848041	Larry Kudlow is an example, who I have a lot of respect for, who loves my tax plan.
0.0	0.315231159243	Number two, I'm a private company, so nobody knows what I'm worth.
0.0	0.232534332632	Well, I agree that we have to have the toughest screening and vetting...
0.0	0.256224177689	Half of them had tears pouring down their face.
0.0	0.148792006168	We will do very, very well, very, very well.
0.0	0.0898183852654	It's not working.
0.0	0.251060841907	Well, there's always a retrospective to say what mistakes were made.
0.0	0.464984980699	There is no president, in my view, not Hillary Clinton, not Bernie Sanders, who has the capability or the power to take on Wall Street, large campaign donors, the corporate media, the big money interests in this country alone.
0.0	0.28994563597	This is about the bigger, broader war against ISIS.
0.0	0.119998502135	It continues with regulatory reform.
0.0	0.0181152466481	We have losers.
0.0	0.247993984482	You know, you claim it is tough talk to discuss carpet bombing.
0.0	0.258686231905	Under the rules, I have been -- I have been invoked, David, so let me respond very quickly.
0.0	0.143567900996	I don't think Ted can have it both ways.
0.0	0.393768994228	It was good for the economy and it was a way to rebuke the terrorists who had attacked our country.
0.0	0.085920970374	Yes.
0.0	0.201236342468	I've dealt with them all my life.
0.0	0.148807388849	I do not support amnesty...
0.0	0.0402701853988	OK.
0.0	0.368374990836	There has to be real tax reform, and the wealthiest and large corporations will pay when I'm president.
0.0	0.0414536722995	Absolutely.
0.0	0.463108360161	We took out the safe haven in Afghanistan, but now there is, undoubtedly, a larger safe haven and we must rise to this occasion in collaboration and with alliances to confront it, and invest in the future much better human intelligence so we know what the next steps are.
0.0	0.0109382915112	No, he doesn't.
0.0	0.182164516135	Planned Parenthood will be defunded.
0.0	0.339880720982	But the thing that is most important to me and caused me to run for office is I'm worried about the country and how much debt we're adding.
1.0	0.882842241689	He has called him a disappointment.
0.0	0.469547751148	And yet the man who led my firing, Tom Perkins, an icon of Silicon Valley, has come out publicly and said, "you know what?
0.0	0.235359125228	I am not a member of the political class.
0.0	0.174412922906	We need to do more on the prescribing end of it.
0.0	0.0898418561623	You opposed him then.
0.0	0.318085457685	So, just to sum up, I would do various things very quickly.
0.0	0.0605787807165	We were wrong.
0.0	0.226326599879	That's the wrong number.
0.0	0.253681717357	That's why when I'm president we are going to rebuild our intelligence capabilities.
0.0	0.166738927117	You can go to my website...
0.0	0.394616205498	Detailed plans count, and I believe that the plan I've laid out to destroy ISIS before the tragedies of San Bernardino and Paris are the right ones.
0.0	0.397569160413	But everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro- gay-marriage, focus around money and the media.
0.0	0.354274831123	At the end of the day, ladies and gentlemen, our best days are ahead of us only if we work together, and I intend to put this country on a path of success by working together and doing the hard things that should have been done a very long time ago.
0.0	0.340551021022	We also had attacks on two of our embassies in Tanzania, Kenya, when my husband was president.
0.0	0.158685355303	By Monday, you will have welcomed me into all 99 counties in Iowa.
0.0	0.410535024592	And I have looked at his proposed plans for health care for example, and it really does transfer every bit of our health care system including private health care, to the states to have the states run.
0.0	0.214783987616	When people go to vote in primaries or caucuses, they are voting not only for the president, they are voting for the commander-in- chief.
0.0	0.183997457696	If that's a blind trust, I don't know.
0.0	0.304460583567	The CEOs of large multinationals may like Hillary.
0.0	0.0127483360414	So was I, John.
0.0	0.04310363284	That's my view.
0.0	0.410221832618	And the Obama-Clinton economy has left behind the working men and women of this country.
0.0	0.410864285847	I was flattered that Secretary Clinton two months later borrowed so many of my proposals to incorporate into hers.
0.0	0.175747369638	I say, "That's a terrible story.
0.0	0.352598523243	Judy, if I can, there is no question, Secretary Clinton and I are friends, and I have a lot of respect for her, that she has enormous experience in foreign affairs.
0.0	0.187618469904	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.278131269381	It's the only way you fix Medicare, the only way you fix Social Security.
0.0	0.0704347845628	Sure.
0.0	0.361422955731	You remember Obama a year ago, Yemen was a great victory.
0.0	0.111480218841	And we need to very, very concerned about that.
0.0	0.21207869337	You get the Congress, you get the Senate, you get together, you do legislation.
0.0	0.196669972904	But here's the point I want to make tonight.
0.0	0.655890543212	...
0.0	0.386484157964	I laid out a plan at the Citadel to do just that and it starts with creating a "No Fly Zone" and "Safe Zones" to make sure refugees are there.
0.0	0.183099740576	What is the best way to do it?
0.0	0.248541700606	That's why we have this abnormal situation going on right now.
0.0	0.209918701114	You see, folks, this is how socialism starts.
0.0	0.304565768527	And to contrast, even -- there are differences among us.
0.0	0.272416307774	Bush is totally in favor of Common Core.
0.0	0.464224378074	So the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced: a simple flat tax, 10 percent for individuals, and a 16 percent business flat tax, you abolish the IRS...
0.0	0.366006010058	Focus on the diseases that are costing us the trillions of dollars.
0.0	0.34575404059	And I would -- first of all, face him down in that whole region, the whole Baltic region.
0.0	0.209998831485	John, I would disagree with Secretary Clinton respectfully on this score.
0.0	0.43270948585	And our focus has got to be on intelligence, increased manpower, fighting internationally targets.
0.0	0.297685073298	And I will have done it within 100 days, and it will pass.
0.0	0.269237558241	Let me tell you, everybody, when they say they want to give it to you for free, keep your hands on your wallets because they're coming to you to pay for it.
0.0	0.28468001522	And we have to take on ISIS online.
0.0	0.299870574615	Now, our country needs -- our country needs a truly great leader, and we need a truly great leader now.
0.0	0.261265223697	When I have to build a hotel, I pay interest.
0.0	0.478071811784	I've said I'm looking at a couple of different ways, one which you mentioned, Senator, but also trying to expand the existing tax to passive income that wealthy people have so that we do get more revenue into the Social Security Trust Fund.
0.0	0.223899793462	And I've got to tell you, it sounded like everything in the world was going amazing, you know?
0.0	0.0508911114757	I (inaudible).
0.0	0.30871623006	It is a constitutional right of every American to be able to protect themselves and their families.
0.0	0.26332630681	Since he brought me up, do I not get to respond?
0.0	0.470650344479	Please do not tell me that in this country, if -- and here's the if -- we have the courage to take on the drug companies, and have the courage to take on the insurance companies, and the medical equipment suppliers, if we do that, yes, we can guarantee health care to all people in a much more cost effective way.
0.0	0.285397715953	Effectively it is day trading without any regulation at all.
0.0	0.434307651351	You sit down and you work with people, you make demands of people, in this case demanding Iran stop the support of international terrorism.
0.0	0.260111659524	And the people of New Jersey, I've seen it.
0.0	0.423787573461	Paul Krugman, the Nobel Prize winning economist, who said my plan for what we should do to reign in Wall Street was more comprehensive and better.
0.0	0.199320512083	I have studied that issue in great detail.
0.0	0.655890543212	What are we doing?
0.0	0.458573335494	And the net result is the middle class has $2,300 less in their pockets than the day that Barack Obama got elected president.
0.0	0.227220416591	They're going to end up in the productive economy, which is where we want them.
0.0	0.4231695914	But Jeb is also right that, if we just impose a tariff, they'll put reciprocal tariffs, which will hurt Iowa farmers and South Carolina producers and 20 percent of the American jobs that depend on exports.
0.0	0.458348347479	I will cut this government down to size and hold it accountable, simplify the tax code, roll back the regulations that have been spewing out of Washington, D.C. for 50 years.
0.0	0.461489142567	It will lower the cost of health care for a middle-class family by thousands of dollars a year.
0.0	0.439932737059	We ought to give them a little bit of a liability release so that they share data amongst themselves and share data with the federal government, they're not fearful of a lawsuit.
0.0	0.37636531915	I met young people who are desperately trying to get clean and have nowhere to go, because there are not enough facilities.
0.0	0.462001632015	I think to be commander in chief in the 21st century requires someone who understands how the economy works, someone who understands how the world works and who's in it; I know more world leaders on the stage today than anyone running, with the possible exception of Hillary Clinton; understands bureaucracies, how to cut them down to size and hold them accountable; and understands technology, which is a tool, but it's also a weapon that's being used against us.
0.0	0.333188523454	But the president needs to be laying the groundwork right now for the ability to slap those sanctions back on worldwide.
1.0	0.374811394118	What Hillary Clinton's going to say, and has said before is, she wants to raise Social Security taxes.
1.0	0.31921346038	And some of them are like third world countries.
0.0	0.0523128454247	I am the son and grandson of immigrants.
0.0	0.00430451372677	...Thank you.
1.0	0.999981441378	We had a $1.4 trillion deficit.
0.0	0.257176127985	This campaign is not just about electing a president.
0.0	0.251134878296	But somehow for decades, nothing really has changed.
0.0	0.453672611561	I can see why people are angry and scared, because this president has created a condition where our national security has weakened dramatically.
0.0	0.21132572132	I will tell you this, I will beat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.126018117105	It didn't have the votes to pass.
0.0	0.384385415873	Well, for a start it means that police officers should not be shooting unarmed people, predominantly African-Americans.
0.0	0.00657879709171	Chris?
0.0	0.254828381464	I had to work my way through school.
0.0	0.13429527153	And we have to have an attitude when we're in government of serving-hood.
0.0	0.0359773926074	I agree with that.
0.0	0.345425356367	China, they don't like to tell us but they have total control -- just about, of North Korea.
0.0	0.097431879195	But I went further than that.
0.0	0.303244239514	We have systemic racism and injustice and inequities in our country and in particular, in our justice system that must be addressed and must be ended.
0.0	0.243056934535	I will do everything I can as president to get that accomplished.
0.0	0.193968144315	So, I think gun-free zones are a catastrophe.
0.0	0.262332829886	And if I am president and we get our hands on him, he is standing trial for treason.
0.0	0.298533663508	I don't get any money from Wall Street.
0.0	0.169109142017	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.27301637405	Why should we let their people be sitting there smoking their cigars, sitting in their comfortable chairs in Raqqa?
0.0	0.40041300033	I own a big chunk of the Bank of America Building at 1290 Avenue of the Americas, that I got from China in a war.
0.0	0.455790188079	Because, Martha, it would prevent people like the guy that just got charged yesterday perhaps from being able to buy combat assault weapons.
0.0	0.0636450737225	He's a gifted politician.
0.0	0.0745453942142	And you know what?
0.0	0.0348433957863	It's not that hard.
0.0	0.345109319764	And I said, "Didn't you resent America for not letting you be with your father in those formative and very threatening years?"
0.0	0.196529769886	I'll suggest a part of that was his celebrity.
0.0	0.0519559617383	Where are you gonna clean it up?
0.0	0.42750233972	After that you pay 10 percent as a flat tax going up.
0.0	0.345765431573	Yes, we could get rid of Gadhafi, a terrible dictator, but that created a vacuum for ISIS.
0.0	0.427982994188	Well, first of all, I didn't say that the rate would be 10 percent.
0.0	0.462949156168	And I also voted and helped lead the effort against the war in Iraq, which will go down in history as one of the worst foreign blunders -- foreign policy blunders in the history of our country.
0.0	0.139677127011	We're always losing this gorgeous brand-new stuff.
0.0	0.341788549768	Two weeks later, the place was blown up.
0.0	0.369993036274	And we finally need to tackle the basics to cut this government down to size and hold it accountable.
0.0	0.0841919949544	Alzheimers, diabetes, heart disease and cancer.
0.0	0.399623719524	... and that's what you and others can start providing in the Senate.
0.0	0.266328125089	The federal government should have to get warrants.
0.0	0.396069435568	They are radicalizing people in the United States, they are conducting attacks around the world.
0.0	0.343411900307	But the differences among us pale compared to what's happening on the Republican side.
0.0	0.268334154698	That's the truth of the matter and you see it every time with this president.
0.0	0.014789350351	He's very charming.
0.0	0.352914393309	I believe if this amendment were to pass, the chances of this bill passing into law would increase dramatically.
0.0	0.176382786314	We're becoming Greece if we don't work together.
0.0	0.346847397546	I don't think the United States should be engaged in symbolic military activity.
0.0	0.394091567087	And it bothers me very much that, rather than working on this issue to resolve it, it has become many press releases from the Clinton campaign later.
0.0	0.386858590917	And I've heard some great ideas about how law enforcement is changing its behavior, how the recovery community is reaching out.
0.0	0.106132625193	They didn't know the air-conditioner didn't work.
0.0	0.221007658172	We have to do away with the strawman proposal.
0.0	0.20552227502	We need to re-establish the relationships with the Sunnis.
0.0	0.1923557769	I'd like to offer a...
0.0	0.0146586620172	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.239639634779	Former elected prosecutor, attorney general, governor, I was elected to all of those offices.
0.0	0.00430451372677	Thank you.
0.0	0.0763006078352	Not everybody remembers that.
0.0	0.167434144497	They elected moderate leaders.
0.0	0.0503070755256	I love China.
0.0	0.097926363968	Not to contain them, but to defeat them.
0.0	0.255654282865	That is a bad deal and an evil situation, and presidents have looked the other way.
0.0	0.307576823674	We also want to dominate this from a commercial side.
0.0	0.176779441088	But most importantly, when you look at what happened in the 1990s, go to berniesanders.com.
0.0	0.0483462617736	It sounds crass.
0.0	0.1527114583	You take a look at the -- at Belgium.
0.0	0.395767267144	And I put forth an immigration policy that is as strong in favor of the folks who are struggling in America the most than anybody else.
0.0	0.391224085521	You know, we can't -- if we're not going to send American troops, which there was never any idea of doing that, then to try to send trainers, to try to send experts, is something we offered, Europeans offered, the U.N. offered, and there wasn't a lot of responsiveness at first.
0.0	0.142255290462	You know, we all have our own individual interpretations of our faith.
0.0	0.172219443964	I get to respond, right?
0.0	0.0745453942142	And you know what?
1.0	0.430939960926	We stuck to the fact that Americans are tired of Washington corporate interests and Democrats who are interested in just politics and power and they're looking for someone who's going to fight for them; looking for someone who's going to grow manufacturing sector of our economy, so those 74 percent of Americans who don't have a college degree have a chance to rise again.
0.0	0.300292470054	It'll be a pretty busy day, but that Iran negotiation is going to be torn up on day one.
0.0	0.290739592815	I have a detailed immigration plan that is on my website, tedcruz.org.
1.0	0.255156546472	And I have liabilities of about $500 million (ph).
0.0	0.462905043988	I do not want to walk my five grandkids through the charred remains of a once great country called America, and say, "Here you go, $20 trillion dollars of debt.
0.0	0.0764572828292	I think that's a mistake.
0.0	0.354756240221	Who do you know will stop amnesty and secure the borders?
0.0	0.345096550887	I am advocating the no-fly zone both because I think it would help us on the ground to protect Syrians; I'm also advocating it because I think it gives us some leverage in our conversations with Russia.
1.0	0.964060443853	Under longstanding U.S. law, the child of a U.S. citizen born abroad is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.40803535912	...The other thing I'd like to make about our plan, one more point, it is the most pro growth tax plan that I can imagine because it doesn't tax investments at all.
0.0	0.23135177649	I believe that we need to focus on destroying ISIL.
0.0	0.18196518094	That's just media stuff.
0.0	0.380415836404	Well, and specifically to Medicare, Becky, because 85 percent of the cost of Medicare is chronic disease.
0.0	0.308828138538	Donald Trump, for example -- I'm glad -- I mentioned his name again just if anybody was missing him...
0.0	0.478036352543	And, if this government doesn't pay it, than tell me what's different between the government and Bernie Madolf, who sits in prison today for doing less than what the government has done to the people on social security and Medicare in this country.
0.0	0.337476246937	You'll see me on the floor of the Senate tomorrow filibustering this and saying enough is enough, no more debt.
0.0	0.34021019348	We have Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view.
0.0	0.280217407719	He might be on one of my courses.
0.0	0.134069474572	Did a couple of cataract surgeries over Christmas holidays.
0.0	0.655890543212	We do.
0.0	0.182626747415	I think it's a good product.
1.0	0.977157065493	I vetoed a statewide I.D. system for gun owners and I pardoned, six out-of-state folks who came through our state and were arrested for owning a gun legally in another state so they never have to face charges.
0.0	0.00430451372677	Thank you.

0.0	0.411116568277	I started the Gang of Seven, and it led to the overtaking of the 40-year Democratic rule of Congress, because I didn't -- I stood up to the old-boy network in Washington, D.C. because I believed that Washington was not the solution, that Washington was the problem, just like Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.27264057241	But many, many people did.
0.0	0.313844686636	... that's the -- that's the false choice in this whole debate about immigration.
0.0	0.370953316828	Because of a series of disastrous trade policies which have allowed corporate America through NAFTA and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, Secretary Clinton and I disagree on those issues.
0.0	0.292890494765	No Wall Street executive has been prosecuted.
0.0	0.122181307278	It's hate action.

0.0	0.0397485016591	That's fine.
0.0	0.317327960074	But I think I'll go back to building buildings if it doesn't work out.
0.0	0.170314988958	There are many lawyers.
0.0	0.387507941225	The men and women on this stage have more ideas, more experience, more common sense than every participant in the Democratic debate.
0.0	0.336717773439	We need to make sure that people understand, as Jeb said before, that if you've done extraordinarily well in this country, do you want them to take more out of your taxes now and think they're gonna give it back to you later?
0.0	0.0745453942142	I know how to do that.
0.0	0.315347214144	And I have laid out specific plans -- you can go to my web site, hillaryclinton.com, and read the details.
0.0	0.11594223679	You look at the patches and the 40-year-old floor.
0.0	0.455988971891	We just heard that most families haven't had a wage increase since 2001.
0.0	0.270969438732	And I can do it regardless of what the makeup of Congress is because I did it in New York state.
0.0	0.316230704327	Because, folks, at the end of the day, the country needs healed.
0.0	0.0526281599741	Check it out.

0.0	0.246303746655	So protect the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.317684719173	But I think if we're ever going to really tackle the problems posed by jihadi extreme terrorism, we need to understand it and realize that it has antecedents to what happened in Iraq and we have to continue to be vigilant about it.
0.0	0.183971122388	I've had my issues with Donald Trump.
0.0	0.422994316616	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.330596439258	And that this world, with American leadership, can and must come together to destroy them.
0.0	0.12921586503	I'm wearing a Trump tie tonight.
0.0	0.346952361173	Well, I would begin by reminding people that at this point in previous presidential elections, Jimmy Carter couldn't win, Ronald Reagan couldn't win, Bill Clinton couldn't win, and neither could've Barack Obama.
0.0	0.144244803838	Can I tell you what?

0.0	0.206536192561	I just want a job.

0.0	0.400240259276	OK. You know, you judge a nation not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how you treat, we treat, the most vulnerable and fragile people in our nation.
0.0	0.338920096444	This has gone on 50 or 60 years where the United States has been involved in overthrowing governments.
0.0	0.14860070838	I changed it in New Jersey.
0.0	0.105937387601	And that's why we're in the trouble that we're in now.
0.0	0.0865741777251	Thank you very much.
0.0	0.186557296289	He doesn't meet -- here's the difference.
0.0	0.329330123212	We have three children, eight, five and one.
0.0	0.120015461663	Hey, I have lobbyists.
0.0	0.283573110694	Senator Cruz, I'd like to respond...
0.0	0.0198309494911	There is a vacuum.
0.0	0.100053765177	That is exactly...
0.0	0.153674116546	But I...
0.0	0.0324492659496	And that's not what we did in Maryland.
0.0	0.254787371531	He makes that deal, Israel maybe won't exist very long.
0.0	0.456840121105	And clearly, what we need to do is get a group of experts together, including people from other countries, some of our friends from Israel, who have had experience screening these people and come up with new guidelines for immigration, and for visas, for people who are coming into this country.
0.0	0.171572540134	And, I'll do that with the country.
0.0	0.158599746181	They don't know how to bring it about.
0.0	0.372683127419	I want to make sure we rein in the excessive use of political power to feather the nest and support the super wealthy.
0.0	0.174258032761	They can't lead us.
0.0	0.152558301542	And no matter what your faith is, that's what I want you to be able to do.
0.0	0.412951374329	Well, first off, let's face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
1.0	0.973938602802	But as you've indicated for millions of American workers, people in New Hampshire -- all over America, they're working longer hours for lower wages deeply worried about their kids.
0.0	0.10293555856	If not, they can stay where they are.
0.0	0.429068559115	Look, I don't believe there's the model -- there's lots of good people that work in finance, Secretary Sanders, but Secretary Clinton, we need to step up and we need to protect Main Street from Wall Street and you can't do that by -- by campaigning as the candidate of Wall Street.
0.0	0.065368641396	It's not about Donald Trump.
0.0	0.373542097306	I believe that we have got to pass comprehensive immigration reform, something that I strongly supported.
0.0	0.334531773438	What I believe has got to happen is there must be an international coalition, including Russia, a well-coordinated effort.
0.0	0.143714618331	And we have to stop all the divisions.
0.0	0.441716308714	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.118643513058	But I'm going to tell you the truth.
0.0	0.366197502859	Secondly, to go after and dismantle their global network of terrorism.
0.0	0.322961082681	And, where we are failing abysmally is in the very high rate of recidivism we see.
0.0	0.131221126721	Not a very pleasant place to be.
0.0	0.206748322714	Well, when you look at the celebrity of Donald Trump, then I think that says a lot about it.
0.0	0.319514401727	I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would.
0.0	0.43091934729	That's what we need to to, and I laid that out prior to the crisis with the advice of a lot of people, including 12 Medal of Honor recipients that I'm proud that they're supporting my campaign.
0.0	0.0175202019456	Divide that out.
0.0	0.21504614441	They need to learn English, adopt our values, roll up their sleeves and get to work.
0.0	0.461489689828	Well, in fact, I would argue that the disastrous invasion of Iraq, something that I strongly opposed, has unraveled the region completely and led to the rise of al-Qaeda and to ISIS.
0.0	0.317323389085	I think we have achieved a great deal with the Iranian nuclear agreement to put a lid on the Iranian nuclear weapons program.
0.0	0.388748018579	Bottom line here is, in the year 2015, we should look at a college degree the same way we looked at a high school degree 50 or 60 years ago.
0.0	0.344106772959	That should be a right of all Americans regardless of the income of their families.
0.0	0.252401105573	Thanks for coming back to me, Maria.
0.0	0.104773154583	You know, the situation is this.
0.0	0.175404995939	If he'd like to play, that's fine.
0.0	0.442599190887	And I want us to be absolutely clear about making sure the insurance companies in the private employer policy arena as well as in the Affordable Care exchanges are properly regulated so that we are not being gamed.
0.0	0.355696535574	Well, let us level with the American people.
0.0	0.0283875162791	Thank you Chris...
0.0	0.0879475085699	And that's what I will do as your president.
0.0	0.290200995823	I could only get two Republican votes on that.
0.0	0.213910479295	How the hell can you vote for this guy?
0.0	0.0725843908026	You're right about that.
0.0	0.215531746015	And he said, oh, I'm never going to attack.
0.0	0.411153515516	I mean, we've seen time and time again, especially in this very troubled region of nation-state failures, and then we have no idea who the next generation of leaders are that are coming forward.
0.0	0.171256575344	My father was born in Italy, and shortly after he was born my grandfather immigrated to this country.
0.0	0.192181549852	You want one?
1.0	0.950047739482	He told the police, "I did it because I was inspired by ISIS," and to this day, the White House still refuses to acknowledge it had anything to do with terror.
0.0	0.292942805881	Community banks are going out of business.
0.0	0.253638074372	No, I think the idea was that president -- then-Senator Obama was wrong for suggesting that it is a good idea to talk to your opponents.
0.0	0.446223950476	And the last line standing between them and our families might be us and a gun.
0.0	0.44982262162	Now, the whole region has been rendered unstable, in part because of the aftermath of the Arab Spring, in part because of the very effective outreach and propagandizing that ISIS and other terrorist groups do.
0.0	0.232778981035	We have all the cards, but we don't know how to use them.
0.0	0.483344466323	But look, there's one big entitlement we can no longer afford as a country, and that is the entitlement that the super wealthy among us, those earning more than a million dollars, feel that they're entitled to pay lower income tax rates and a far lower preferred income tax rate when it comes to capital gains.
0.0	0.320428376626	So, I think it's important for us to be careful about the language we use, which is why I've been critical of Donald Trump.
0.0	0.3324368629	It's a simple flat tax for everyone.
0.0	0.352311397576	People died, and only three people have been fired.
0.0	0.24089152539	And yet that's the kind of mindset that you need to make this country great again.
0.0	0.481574479927	The fact is, in order to get this economy moving again, I call for freezing regulations for a year except for the problem of public safety.
0.0	0.351566246614	And make sure you enhance savings in the private market.
0.0	0.290454946367	He's the one that did Bergdahl.
0.0	0.514380925038	So we pay for this by do demanding that the wealthiest people and the largest corporations, who have gotten away with murder for years, start paying their fair share.
0.0	0.337422530637	We need a ground force in Iraq and Syria, and America has to be part of that ground force.
1.0	0.956472250147	Everybody voted for it wanting to see Libya move toward democracy, of course we all wanted to do that.
0.0	0.184510872391	So we have to rebuild our infrastructure, our bridges, our roadways, our airports.
0.0	0.202469555172	Bencarson.com -- we will heal, inspire and revive America for our children.
0.0	0.400826239148	President Obama's preparing to send $100 billion or more to the Ayatollah Khamenei.
0.0	0.462965019042	Obviously, we were distressed when we learned of it, because we have worked very hard -- I said in the beginning of this campaign, we want to reach as many voters as possible, and we have tens of thousands of volunteers doing that, and entering data all the time to keep up with what people are telling us.

0.0	0.0599586264155	It was terrible.
0.0	0.379015900521	I can only say that we both share the goal of universal health care coverage.

0.0	0.307622076969	And I cannot wait to earn the opportunity to do it because she cannot be the president of the United States.
0.0	0.358522012221	I think, and this is not easy, but I think we need to make wage a major effort, to come together as a country and end institutional racism.
0.0	0.187925813111	How stupid are these politicians to allow this to happen?
0.0	0.256971309885	Liberty thrives when government is small.
0.0	0.433337897547	We invested more in our infrastructure and we squared our shoulders to the great business opportunity of this era and that is moving our economy to a 100 percent clean electric energy future.

0.0	0.449506226549	We raised the military spending, took from entitlements, and raised domestic spending and the deficit will explode under this.
0.0	0.387034605342	So the things I have done in office are the things that actually invest in growing our economy and making wages go up.
0.0	0.412881837125	And the bottom line is this, we are not going to be able to do anything on this issue until we first bring illegal immigration under control.
0.0	0.418243810861	But because Ted stood up and helped lead the effort, millions rose up to kill it.
0.0	0.22882990847	That never works.

0.0	0.184998145551	Just know where you want to go, stick to your guts.
0.0	0.374733030661	And we've got to get back to where people can save money again, where they can invest in their families, and I don't think a middle-class tax should be part of anybody's plan right now.
0.0	0.0354539283296	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.317764735157	And remember, the Russians have not gone after ISIS or any of the other terrorist groups.

0.0	0.133218404045	I've gotten to do some incredible things.
0.0	0.382447742737	Today, many of us picked up our newspapers, and we were horrified to see the sight of 10 American sailors on their knees, with their hands on their heads.
0.0	0.442066661361	You just see the recent deal announced today or yesterday, more spending, more tax increasing, more regulation.
0.0	0.0819959020883	They have to be alert to problems.
0.0	0.206895148679	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.216308474531	The only way we're going to solve this problem is with we, the people.

1.0	0.474896401744	Six million more people living in poverty than the day that Barack Obama got elected president, and the left just wants more of the same.
0.0	0.386592507342	And those countries who are opposed to Islam, they are going to have to get deeply involved in a way that is not the case today.
0.0	0.00430451372677	Thank you.

0.0	0.356234780227	Community- based businesses and farms are getting crushed.
0.0	0.529593704944	What I said, and let me repeat it, I don't know what economists Secretary Clinton is talking to, but what I have said, and let me repeat it, that yes, the middle -- the family right in the middle of the economy would pay $500 dollars more in taxes, and get a reduction in their healthcare costs of $5,000 dollars.

0.0	0.447243530671	And when it began, we had no political organization, no money, and not much name recognition outside of the state of Vermont.
0.0	0.369563401864	So what I would say is, number one, we need to be united against the threats that we face.
0.0	0.407978069426	Well, first of all, this is an issue that's been debated now for 30 years.
0.0	0.30668043871	But they're going to have incentive to work, because the greatest social program is a job.
0.0	0.0402701853988	OK?

0.0	0.291147216911	This is a country that is of, for and by the people.
0.0	0.291436082758	They said they would get rid of the unconstitutional amnesty.
0.0	0.0172121871251	Sorry.
0.0	0.423380350576	In the crowd today is Major General James Livingston, who's the co-chairman of my campaign here in South Carolina, a Medal of Honor recipient.
0.0	0.0777901502851	See, here's the thing.
0.0	0.443201861054	But in the interim, in the absence of that, what's happening is some of these tech companies are taking those -- those centers (ph) to Canada because they can get people to go over there instead of here.
0.0	0.0824861460838	We don't need that.
0.0	0.29562397165	Well, I just think you're asking a question with a false choice.
0.0	0.188330278508	We're going to let people in, but they're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.222231076692	None of that information was looked at.
0.0	0.157054629851	And I said, "I know.
0.0	0.291403942474	But I like to be unpredictable so that people don't know exactly... (LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.156477716198	We should be developing oil, and gas, and coal, and nuclear, and wind, and solar, and ethanol, and biofuels.
0.0	0.442118636431	It shifts it to the business, and it would allow middle class people to get a tax cut.
0.0	0.288566839002	I want to do more to help incentivize and create more small businesses.
0.0	0.154090680735	But what's wrong is your premise in the question.
0.0	0.39510479934	And if we want to try to rebuild the coalition, as Governor Kasich was saying before, then what we better do is to get to the Arab countries that believe that ISIS is a threat, not only to them, but to us and to world peace, and bring them together.
0.0	0.361675456943	There are many crises that come -- a water crisis in Toledo.
0.0	0.321719190238	Secondly, as it relates to Iran, we need to confront their ambitions across the board.
0.0	0.399349327798	And we are going to be able to defeat ISIS on the ground there, as well as in this world, because of the Muslim Americans in our country and throughout the world who understand that this brutal and barbaric group is perverting the name of a great world religion.
0.0	0.0667186432803	Mr. President, we're not against you.
0.0	0.282077545499	I mean, let's talk about this arc of instability that Secretary Clinton talked about.
0.0	0.238316320236	The D.C. politicians continue to make things worse.
0.0	0.360683548666	I feel very strongly that we have to reform our criminal justice system and we have to find ways to try to bring law enforcement together again with the communities that they are sworn to protect.
0.0	0.453417043253	We cut taxes and we had a $5 trillion projected surplus when I left.
0.0	0.230180552095	We think we're going to do very well in Iowa with the liberty vote.
0.0	0.389199441253	Now, I find it rather amazing, because I happen to believe that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country.
0.0	0.369721152383	I'm running because we need to address the planetary crisis of climate change and take on the fossil fuel industry and transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy.
0.0	0.383568243064	Like we have a -- we have a lot of work to do and we're the only nation on the planet that buries as many of our people from gun violence as we do.
0.0	0.310947092503	When I think about the folks who are out there at home tonight watching, and I think about what they had to watch this week -- the spectacle they had to watch on the floor of the House of Representatives, with the president of the United States, who talked a fantasy land about the way they're feeling.
0.0	0.322045065253	How does that help us?  TRUMP R 15 94 1 N Where is that good?
0.0	0.253068884819	Thank you, good night and may the force be with you.
0.0	0.00813380990828	I was in Burlington, Iowa.
0.0	0.0870172697566	My oldest daughter's a teacher.
0.0	0.307005745846	And the reasons why I've done is I don't believe we have a good process of being able to vet them.
0.0	0.282787782066	Each one of them, you know, described their child, had a picture.
0.0	0.185909507666	What we know is we're living longer.
0.0	0.218166878115	Neil, my name was mentioned as well.
1.0	0.0933242907262	It got stolen from them.
0.0	0.155196323123	In all due respect...
0.0	0.227362411531	And not just green cards.
0.0	0.416822839247	Because we work with the private sector to make solar energy affordable and available to businesses and individuals in our state.
0.0	0.44714868527	So a large accounting firm and my accountants have been working for months, because it's big and complex, and they've put together a statement, a financial statement, just a summary.
0.0	0.403959557482	There's mergers that are happening in every aspect of our country that is bad for competition and it's bad for -- for upward mobility of wages.
0.0	0.122429703124	So here's this -- the situation, I think, Maria.
0.0	0.382435827027	You know, as I said already twice in this debate, we have a very serious problem in this country.
0.0	0.256001275746	But the Democrats are going to bring a lawsuit, and you have to have certainty.
1.0	0.988828929916	Senator Sanders voted to give immunity to gun dealers.
0.0	0.198519662943	We can develop that, you know?
0.0	0.307489740614	Look, it takes three things basically to grow jobs.
0.0	0.229708840639	And this is why you need to send someone from outside of Washington to Washington.
0.0	0.332884948309	And all over New Hampshire, I met grandmothers who are raising children because they lost the father or the mother to an overdose.
0.0	0.335620851108	When I'm president of the United States we are getting rid of Obamacare and we are rebuilding our military.
0.0	0.332508315941	I like Chris Christie, but we can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports Common Core.
0.0	0.197222459491	He's in favor of Common Core.
0.0	0.364595620272	We've got challenges in the South China Sea because of what China is doing in building up these military installations.
0.0	0.337385184646	So what we're going to have to start doing instead of, you know, picking on this group or this group, is we're going to have to have a major reduction in the regulatory influence that is going on.
1.0	0.991408895849	Women should not be making 79 cents on the dollar compared to that.
0.0	0.341009489445	And the thing is, she can't be a champion of women's rights at the same time she's got this that is always lurking out there, this type of behavior.
0.0	0.452754138753	The major priority, right now, in terms of our foreign and military policy should be the destruction of ISIS.
0.0	0.350798182733	Yeah, David, look, for crying out loud, our country has been attacked, we have pressing issues involving how we're going to adapt to this changing era of warfare.
0.0	0.378962573871	If you look at history, John, you will find that regime change -- whether it was in the early '50s in Iran, whether it was toppling Salvador Allende in Chile, whether it is overthrowing the government of Guatemala way back when -- these invasions, these toppling of governments, regime changes have unintended consequences.
0.0	0.371042582783	And yet when he won, he turned to me, trusting my judgment, my experience, to become secretary of state.
0.0	0.430119673845	One of them being that if you don't have some agreement within the system from states and from families and from students, it's hard to get to where we need to go.
0.0	0.224523661314	We pay federal taxes.
0.0	0.283227195019	I introduced a series of amendments, each designed to fix problems in the bill.
0.0	0.158272194954	They can't see the government as an adversary, we can't see them as obstructionists.
0.0	0.299287788625	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
1.0	0.970939589449	And they would, despite all their tough talk about terrorism, continue to let people who are on the no-fly list buy guns.
0.0	0.377995319386	You have two billionaire hedge fund managers who started a super PAC and they're advertising against me in Iowa as we speak.
0.0	0.0918526055885	But we don't know.
0.0	0.191458913571	The fact of the matter is we're not going to have peace -- we are not going to have peace in Syria.
0.0	0.429471738535	The federal government can play a role in allowing them to do that, but they should not -- the process of statehood or the status of Puerto Rico won't be solved until we get to the bigger issue of how you deal with the structural economic problems they're facing right now.
0.0	0.428308688833	But a great nation like ours should not be in a position where elderly people are cutting their pills in half, where they don't have decent nutrition, where they can't heat their homes in the wintertime.
0.0	0.128643355293	I know the overrated ones.
0.0	0.0708040654302	It's not only offensive; it's dangerous.
0.0	0.161777833435	The more the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected are advantaged.
0.0	0.13053089724	How stupid are our leaders?
0.0	0.341050124001	We can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports gun control.
0.0	0.30776138451	If somebody's already stolen money from you, are you going to give them more?
0.0	0.242456450938	Now, Bill, he loves to criticize America, apologize for us, criticize medieval Christians.
0.0	0.400929092698	We just, earlier this week, kicked them out of Medicaid in Louisiana as well, canceled their provider contract.
0.0	0.340192084261	Be careful of a bubble because what you've seen in the past might be small potatoes compared to what happens.
0.0	0.484049116865	You know, I was a senator from New York after 9/11, and we spent countless hours trying to figure out how to protect the city and the state from perhaps additional attacks.
0.0	0.0541006888061	I'm ready.
0.0	0.0858071273372	That's a drag on the economy.
0.0	0.245900121725	Those are two leaders that I admire very much.
0.0	0.202492164523	We now have that.
0.0	0.254243452477	Because that's what we'd get if it were Jeb -- I tell you what, we don't need that.
0.0	0.120942842416	President Obama and I are friends.
0.0	0.0529506631132	You are not our adversary, you are our partner.
0.0	0.367248043221	I think that what Libya then did by having a full free election, which elected moderates, was an indication of their crying need and desire to get on the right path.
0.0	0.287690890007	Eleven points, to be exact.
0.0	0.357001513399	The president doesn't understand -- and by the way, neither does Secretary Clinton -- and here's my warning to everybody out in the audience tonight.
0.0	0.340991611603	We don't have procurement being done for refreshing the equipment.
0.0	0.466874159228	Well, again, I mean, obviously, as already has been pointed out, the only budget that Ted has ever voted for is a budget that Rand Paul sponsored that brags about cutting defense spending.
0.0	0.283094176096	And so everybody needs to discount some of the things you're going to hear in these ads, and discount the -- the back-and-forth here, because every person here is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.377426732631	And I think what the president has consistently said-- which I agree with-- is that we will support those who take the fight to ISIS.
0.0	0.191446594743	...Or, even some famous Colorado brownies.
0.0	0.430805832206	Secondly, in our state, we went from a loss of 350,000 jobs to, now, a gain of 347,000 jobs to the positive.
0.0	0.138016799294	You know, I like Marco.
0.0	0.285549265845	So, there does need to be a whole of government approach, but just because we're involved and we have a strategy doesn't mean we're going to be able to dictate the outcome.
0.0	0.179463378461	That's why I've got such a good plan.
0.0	0.218557047225	So, here's a couple of stories happened recently.
0.0	0.316400585483	That's basically bordering on a miracle because of our great prison director.
0.0	0.14908157469	Not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.29967294374	But when we came to Washington, we made a different choice.
0.0	0.432094499896	When he meets with the attorney general in the White House, it's not "how can we protect the Second Amendment rights of Americans."
0.0	0.0800142160183	What they do is unbelievable, how bad.
0.0	0.0263088043322	He's a progressive economist.
0.0	0.0599640396104	Kathie, I think -- Kathie the...
0.0	0.309872433976	Let me tell you, Donald Trump would be a president every day of the week and twice on Sunday, rather than Hillary.
0.0	0.405068132265	Now, the proposal that I have outlined, you know, should be familiar to you, because it is what essentially Barack Obama campaigned on in 2008.
0.0	0.474420761214	I would certainly tackle the cost issues, because I think that once the foundation was laid with a system to try to get as many people as possible into it, to end insurance discrimination against people with preexisting conditions or women, for example, that, yes, we were going to have to figure out how to get more competition in the insurance market, how to get the costs of -- particularly, prescription drugs, but other out-of-pocket expenses down.
0.0	0.342052466586	I think, Secretary Clinton, $1.61 a week is a pretty good invest.
0.0	0.214546303309	I will break up these banks.
0.0	0.0920430218765	And I mean, are you kidding me?
0.0	0.125361773484	We have people that don't have it.
0.0	0.494657074285	Some of the bravest people that I had the privilege of working with as secretary of state were our development professionals who went sometimes alone, sometimes with our military, into very dangerous places in Iraq, in Afghanistan, elsewhere.
0.0	0.318278020302	And I will say this, this is going to be an election, in my opinion, that's based on competence.
0.0	0.215003769261	That's what we need to do as a nation.
0.0	0.655890543212	No.
0.0	0.363624426705	When was the last time anybody saw us beating, let's say, China in a trade deal?
0.0	0.257944174572	And Abdullah said something recently, very important.
0.0	0.215478773503	We have a serious problem with, as you know, with radical Islam.
0.0	0.0326981719396	Wow.
0.0	0.0618186919978	Are you not running?
0.0	0.457135479492	And I think that the record of the governor of the last 14 years of the 12th largest economy in the world is just the medicine America is looking for.
0.0	0.096650466862	That could be the great Trojan Horse.
0.0	0.354344521184	And if you elect me president, we will bring incredible growth back to this country.
0.0	0.0939483949415	It can happen.
0.0	0.137659929732	My name was mentioned.
0.0	0.241255862637	We should have debt-free college if you go to a public college or university.
0.0	0.339201097535	They went to the vendor and said, "hey, something is wrong," and that was quietly dealt with.
0.0	0.0986148681795	Jared (ph), Laura and Eric, I'm very proud of my family.
0.0	0.180642439051	That's not the way the game is supposed to be played.
0.0	0.129981090435	They're very, very badly wounded.
0.0	0.417761314667	And now after seven years of your policies, we have the biggest majority we've had since the 1920s in the House; a Republican majority in the Senate; and 31 out of 50 Republican governors.
0.0	0.350876234375	If we means test Social Security, it means that the government decides whether or not I deserve it.
1.0	0.986552713148	I lost that election by three percentage points.
0.0	0.409498095096	When I'm president, we are rebuilding the U.S. military because the world is a safer and a better place when America is the strongest military in the world.
0.0	0.405020444299	And now what we have is a whole stretch now, of the coast of Libya, 100 miles, 150 miles, that has now become potentially the next safe haven for ISIL.
0.0	0.151439939651	Listen, we can solve immigration.
0.0	0.283199694622	I can govern by bringing people together.
0.0	0.0685846860749	You can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.245862463983	We need new leadership.
0.0	0.244915511224	The president tried to paint a rosy picture of jobs.
0.0	0.279986304163	I'll bring back our jobs from China, from Mexico, from Japan, from so many places.
0.0	0.0881692367686	That's not capitalism, Secretary Clinton.
0.0	0.195397212531	And we have -- and let me make this promise.
1.0	0.416363674752	We owe $19 trillion, boy am I good at solving debt problems.
0.0	0.321100478252	The deployments are too high for the military personnel.
0.0	0.164671008807	And, they've insinuated themselves into everything.
0.0	0.140929743693	Does anyone know this?"
0.0	0.330778117635	No, the Federal Government should not play a larger role.
0.0	0.219688598008	What you saw was a parade of, "I'll give you this for free; I'll give you that for free."
0.0	0.446447853379	In my view, we have got to see that weapons designed by the military to kill people are not in the hands of civilians.
0.0	0.26440481462	But wait, I just want to say this Senator.
0.0	0.424623837093	What we have got to do is make it clear that any police officer who breaks the law will, in fact, be held accountable.
0.0	0.06403160456	That's how you solve the problem.
0.0	0.136367259476	So I want to tell you this story.
0.0	0.335491884409	And if I find anybody else involved in this, they will also be fired.
0.0	0.435196443079	Low income people who are not involved in the political process.
0.0	0.366217601031	The fact that each amendment didn't fix every problem didn't mean that I supported the rest of the bill.
0.0	0.284592388395	There are a lot of things we've got to do in our country, reigning in Wall Street is certainly one of them.
0.0	0.0430890218419	We need Jordan.
0.0	0.334630534457	As a result of his efforts and the efforts of Joe Biden against unprecedented, I was there in the Senate, unprecedented Republican obstructionism, we have made enormous progress.
0.0	0.440882493137	I've seen so much of it - a Soviet Union, the coming down of a wall, the issues that we saw around the world in Central America, the potential spread of communism, and 9/11 and Gulf War.
0.0	0.413264343844	To use the Justice Department, as we just saw, they have said they are going to sue Ferguson, that entered into a consent agreement, and then tried to back out.
0.0	0.363003089708	We should look at college today the way high school was looked at 60 years ago.
0.0	0.164219504023	I think that would have been right, as well.
1.0	0.956216806242	She said that here in Iowa just two days ago.
0.0	0.187239966665	And Lehman Brothers started it all.
0.0	0.153844962522	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.361616172762	They have got to quit trying to ship rockets into Gaza that can be used against Israel.
0.0	0.331792428827	The media noise will soon be over and it's now for the men and women of Iowa to decide.
0.0	0.300960312919	My father used to say, "Johnny, we never -- we don't hate the rich.
1.0	0.550191909042	People are working longer hours for lower wages, and almost all of the new income and wealth goes to the top one percent.
0.0	0.188595749594	You're seeing cities like Seattle.
0.0	0.0501018514293	Look what we did in Iran with Mosaddegh.
0.0	0.394212377465	Not only are deductibles rising, 29 million Americans still have no health insurance and millions of people can't afford to go to the doctor.
0.0	0.304087020482	I've had a lot of folks give me donations from all kinds of backgrounds say, I don't agree with you on everything, but I like what you do.
0.0	0.374101191319	And I'll tell you the endorsements that I am proud of are the over 200,000 volunteers across this country who have signed up to volunteer for our campaign.
1.0	0.475753916975	According to the statistics that I'm familiar with, a black male baby born today stands a one in four chance of ending up in the criminal justice system.
0.0	0.453647668053	And if you make $40,000 a year, a family of four, you don't pay any income tax at all.
1.0	0.970988114356	First of all, I didn't support Sonia Sotomayor.
0.0	0.391485107671	We have -- wait a second, we have $19 trillion in debt.
0.0	0.386628782654	It's what we did in the first Persian Gulf war; 1,100 air attacks a day, saturation bombing that utterly destroyed the enemy.
0.0	0.20664911704	You know, let me say something at the outset.
0.0	0.249906724849	They say, " well, we don't really have control."
0.0	0.0179458472762	That's what they're doing.
0.0	0.146783164486	The bill would involve legalization.
0.0	0.0127483360414	...John...
0.0	0.37848766714	And second, the international crisis we are facing is most dreadful and most dangerous.
0.0	0.306760202823	We call that the American Dream, although, it's built on the universal dream of a better life.
0.0	0.235700897718	And when you do that, you will be amazed at how much progress you can make, and how much healing we can have.
0.0	0.426187800625	The only way to figure that out is to go back to getting the intelligence community the funding and the tools that it needs to be able to keep America safe.
0.0	0.414443216458	I have made very clear that hardworking, middle-class families need a raise, not a tax increase.
0.0	0.0918526055885	He didn't know.
0.0	0.364883672775	But it is absolutely fair and necessary for Americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average American family?
0.0	0.378128732343	And aligned with a corrupt campaign finance system is a rigged economy.
0.0	0.179712227487	We know this for a fact.
0.0	0.128716877593	I think he'd be a great spirit."
0.0	0.245278453424	... first of all, I'm -- don't worry, I'm not leaving the stage no matter what you ask me.
0.0	0.223414487865	I've got a very simple strategy as your president against ISIL.
0.0	0.157528476294	I said, "What's your problem?"
0.0	0.278510378524	You wrote a book where you changed your position from a path of citizenship to a path of legalization.
0.0	0.221795612073	I'll tell you what else people are concerned about.
0.0	0.124212464223	They are much more than that.
0.0	0.0515945529102	They will not.
0.0	0.182271308891	He's the greatest show on earth.
0.0	0.466058137325	I would note, just for a historic aside, somebody told me earlier today we've had like 200 presidential primary debates, and this is the first time there have been a majority of women on the stage.
0.0	0.303997971403	So the fact is that we work for the people.
0.0	0.361347138101	For over 200 years, America's light has been shining on the world and the world has never been the same again.
0.0	0.285271385366	But I guess the final thing that -- that I would say is this is the kind of debate we need to take to the Republicans in the fall.
0.0	0.151467951644	But before you do that, you've got to think about what happens the day after.
0.0	0.316669252544	Actually going to do something to help the American worker.
0.0	0.360560488085	But I also want to create jobs and I want to be a partner with the private sector.
0.0	0.390016114705	In fact, one of the big banks came to me and said, "Donald, you don't have enough borrowings.

0.0	0.0430364348561	Great.
0.0	0.218028081137	You see, we usually elect presidents in America that want to change the things that are wrong in America.
0.0	0.15515800484	But -- but Megyn, the bill was 1,000 pages.
0.0	0.0186338725874	I have no illusion.
0.0	0.35389828638	It's a -- it's absolutely disgraceful that Secretary Kerry and others said in their response to what's going on in Iran that this was a good thing; it showed how the relationship was getting better.
0.0	0.203163997158	It's never been that way in American politics before.
0.0	0.419436079472	At the end of the day, if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, and the governor makes a good point about trade, anti-trade, anti-monopoly activities.
0.0	0.357283486249	They are more likely to know what's happening in their families and their communities, and they need to feel not just invited, but welcomed within the American society.
0.0	0.0741588697799	That's what we need.
0.0	0.27386126837	It's very important we operate on both at the same time.
0.0	0.238079742356	We've got to figure out how we can do more to understand who is saying what and what they're planning.
0.0	0.468970280323	And what I said and I think what Governor O'Malley is saying, and I hope you say, is when the middle class of this country is disappearing, when we have massive income and wealth inequality, when we're the only major country on earth not guaranteeing health care to all people, all the issues that the governor talked about, the secretary talked about, those are the issues.
0.0	0.158499786256	They had a plan that was good.
0.0	0.364566755419	The reality is that both the African-American community and the white community do marijuana at about equal rates.
0.0	0.404172304335	You will be the first Americans that get to answer the fundamental question, what comes next for this country after seven disastrous years of Barack Obama?
0.0	0.241750078302	All right, Nancy, I really wish you'd come back to me on this on this one, John...

0.0	0.378541463749	Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns.

0.0	0.276060939531	We're nowhere close to a balanced budget or fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.215293799235	Now, I understand that this is very difficult.
0.0	0.0809533050549	And that was the state of Texas.
0.0	0.181899515746	I'm angry because our country is a mess.
0.0	0.142752900692	Well, a couple of things.
0.0	0.0833028346807	Everybody knows that.
0.0	0.156229456195	Because I think everybody has to have some skin in this game, you know.
0.0	0.454847400219	My father came to this country from Poland at the age of 17 without a nickel in his pocket, which sparked my interest in the need for immigration reform because I know what it's like to be the son of an immigrant.
0.0	0.380533120389	If you just cut their income tax, there isn't much income tax to cut.
0.0	0.29446037007	May I jump in here for 30 seconds on health care?
0.0	0.0900123466088	This election is not only about electing a president.
0.0	0.465764084591	Now that Russia has joined us in the Security Council, has adopted an agreement that we hashed out a long day in Geneva three years ago, now I think we can have those conversations.
0.0	0.399400792155	Planned Parenthood had better hope that Hillary Clinton wins this election, because I guarantee under President Jindal, January 2017, the Department of Justice and the IRS and everybody else that we can send from the federal government will be going in to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.0599130769737	Bipartisan issue.
0.0	0.278962800395	We have got to come forward with a consensus that in fact will work.
0.0	0.424497123151	Why are there five even bigger Wall Street banks now, instead of the ten we used to have on Wall Street?
0.0	0.219042294452	So don't put people in there if you don't want them bombed.
0.0	0.410102963215	I'm running for president to knock down all the barriers that are holding Americans back, and to rebuild the ladders of opportunity that will give every American a chance to advance, especially those who have been left out and left behind.
0.0	0.426784163618	Here's why, the president of the United States and both his attorney's general, they give the benefit of the doubt to the criminal, not to the police officers.
0.0	0.179761944295	And a lot of people are doing that.
0.0	0.119567083044	We always had such a loving relationship in these debates and in between and the tweets.
0.0	0.364779159068	What our country needs right now is new leadership that will bring us together around the values that unite us and the freedoms that we share as Americans.

0.0	0.220577069498	I mean, my dad went to college on a G.I.
0.0	0.246619197003	But what we need to do is turn it over to the regional powers to be able to handle that.
0.0	0.252179922145	Yeah, but the rule includes equal -- got it.
0.0	0.258796117292	And -- and -- you know, the concept of New York values is not that complicated to figure out.
0.0	0.137483637825	That's not profiling, that's law enforcement.
0.0	0.165710181161	The sort of genocide and brutality that the victims are suffering, these are not the perpetrators.
0.0	0.187024471545	This election has to be about reversing all of that damage.
0.0	0.212280060843	Well, I've got news for you, we can.
0.0	0.0585367215739	The problem is...
0.0	0.309011194599	We're soon going to be at $20 trillion.
0.0	0.315416527308	I saw Ted Cruz say, "we'll take citizenship off the table, and then the bill will pass, and I'm for the bill."
0.0	0.452562984604	Well, I don't agree with that, because we will not get the support on the ground in Syria to dislodge ISIS if the fighters there who are not associated with ISIS, but whose principal goal is getting rid of Assad, don't believe there is a political, diplomatic channel that is ongoing.
0.0	0.301671160576	So I don't know if you would call that a weakness, but my wife said "let up."
0.0	0.0887513190531	He was a little teddy bear to me.
0.0	0.360154268588	Well, first, the most important job of being president is obviously to keep our country safe and to keep the families of America safe.
0.0	0.17867268298	America was worth the wait.
0.0	0.0448888314149	They have no choice.

0.0	0.165581707461	Somebody says "I'm a fighter."
0.0	0.267639692965	Under -- under Barack Obama and the proposals of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and others, they've tried it their way, and it has failed miserably.
0.0	0.353806668469	What we need now is a proven leader who has produced results.
0.0	0.375746380577	Washington gets bigger, taxes get higher, and the American people feel more distance from our government.
0.0	0.338344770809	If you elect me president of the United States, I will secure that southern border.
0.0	0.39378947995	You have to be hit by a tractor, literally, a tractor, to use it, because the deductibles are so high, it's virtually useless.
0.0	0.21567275289	It could be people that are going to do great, great destruction.
0.0	0.179182527733	So you should go out, get a declaratory judgment, let the courts decide.
0.0	0.40605732802	They have a sophisticated understanding of our legal immigration system and we now have an obligation to ensure that they are not able to use that system against us.
0.0	0.0685846860749	And you can't do that to the party.

0.0	0.277732702068	And I think that's an important point to make because I'm going through and analyzing the points you were making, Martha.
0.0	0.344399081516	I've learned from him that what we need to achieve is peace through strength, which means we need to rebuild the military.
0.0	0.400568968679	And, indeed, my tax plan that I've introduced, it's available on our website.
0.0	0.281677316203	Our job has to be to recognize the conflict between the two.
0.0	0.297079341236	The American people are never going to trust Washington, D.C., and for good reason.
0.0	0.454332373952	But what is to prevent a future liberal president or a liberal Congress from coming back and not just raising the income tax, but also raising that VAT tax, and that vat tax is really bad for seniors.
0.0	0.0234981171389	We bailed them out.
0.0	0.34290910508	But I would say that if you want to defend the country, it begins with border security.
1.0	0.965910015653	They were watching the humiliation of our young ten sailors, sitting on the floor with their knees in a begging position, their hands up.
0.0	0.141286123476	They're never going to let it happen.
0.0	0.201924039454	And it has been a remarkable situation in our state.
0.0	0.320189300723	That we work with allies around the world to protect democratic values.
0.0	0.0500060919948	We overcame the NRA's objections.
0.0	0.139576646475	But you would index it -- you would index it to the median wage.
0.0	0.271561531782	If you can't make a good deal with a politician, then there's something wrong with you.
0.0	0.283596160403	And as president of the United States, it's all about communication, folks.
0.0	0.274898082944	We're going to suspend -- I've -- I've said this for four years.
0.0	0.217493769689	I think we ought to put in our missile defense system.
0.0	0.171959785857	A growth of 385,000 jobs.

0.0	0.208441494483	I have many friends that deal with China.
0.0	0.379984378575	And Megyn, it's best not to talk anymore about back doors and encryption, it will get solved, but it needs to be solved in the situation of the White House with the technology folks.
0.0	0.37866080422	Chris, I would note that that the last four questions have been, "Rand, please attack Ted.
0.0	0.198574972853	Somebody said, "Oh, that's crass."
0.0	0.481705206262	And what I have concluded is that the best policy is to get rid of all government subsidies, and get the government out of our lives, and let people rise and fall based on how good they are.
0.0	0.33261964219	-- work better to lift everyone up, men and women.
0.0	0.389956687792	We the people of the United States in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare and secure the benefits of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this constitution of the United States of America.
0.0	0.29070966261	I was one of the original sponsors of the DREAM Act.

0.0	0.262803418158	When we do business with China, they tax us.
0.0	0.0633129605578	We're friends.
0.0	0.252862860117	For once, let's do that, and stop trying to give them some kind of fantasy that's never going to come true.
0.0	0.395970249733	It is not a radical idea to say that if somebody works 40 hours a week, that person should not be living in poverty.
0.0	0.0869059478512	All right.
1.0	0.184532188821	The 500,000 who came home with PTSD, and traumatic brain injury.
0.0	0.410053966983	We end up paying the highest prices in the world.
0.0	0.383671836024	In fact, I was all for you until you started doing that, because that's a misrepresentation, number one.
0.0	0.418900105829	That beautiful young woman who's an entrepreneur who served in the military, first of all, is deserving of our respect for service in the military and the fact that she's an entrepreneur.
0.0	0.130076300955	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.445009392345	Every (inaudible) Democrat and senator in support of this proposal introduced by your good friend and my good friend, Kirsten Gillibrand, Rosa DeLauro, got ears (ph) to legislation out there that will finally provide family and medical leave.
0.0	0.0156808071655	I was the architect.
0.0	0.273398886669	Just like getting rid of Medicare and Medicaid.
0.0	0.281591734973	So, also, we can stimulate the economy.
0.0	0.294714175827	Well, this is what I would say, and the Congressman was right.
0.0	0.212365866859	He invoked mine as well.
0.0	0.200553501149	Absolutely, we need to defund Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.442112908363	So we have no disagreement about the need to buttress Social Security, get more revenue into the program.
0.0	0.397392053596	And when you do that, when you're in a position of managing regulations; when you reduce taxes; and when you have fiscal discipline, you see the job creators begin to get very comfortable with the fact that they can invest.
0.0	0.334012834871	No hour is too short, no dollar too small.
0.0	0.241472761039	But this is what we also have to say.
0.0	0.349001961864	The American people have rejected your agenda and now you're trying to go around it.
0.0	0.303159558128	So -- because we got to make the country rich.
0.0	0.416125256718	I worry greatly that the rhetoric coming from the Republicans, particularly Donald Trump, is sending a message to Muslims here in the United States and literally around the world that there is a "clash of civilizations," that there is some kind of Western plot or even "war against Islam," which then I believe fans the flames of radicalization.
0.0	0.170220433322	In this building, in Trump Tower.
0.0	0.207646866131	Let me agree with Governor O'Malley and let me agree with Secretary Clinton.
0.0	0.223994881736	A lot of people have jumped in here.
1.0	0.954083801855	It was an effort led by several people that provided almost an instant path with very little obstacles moving forward.
0.0	0.367127622469	You see, why are we one of the most generous people in the world -- no, the most generous people in the world?
0.0	0.216622647435	End -- end Common Core.
0.0	0.433596846946	But at the end of the day, Wall Street today has enormous economic and political power.
0.0	0.332371207032	Putting Iranian troops right on the border of the Golan right next to Israel would be a nonstarter for me.
0.0	0.433393153595	She has devoted her life, when I was mayor of the city of Burlington, actually when I first met her, we started a youth office, which started a after-school programs for kids, started a child care center, started a youth newspaper.
0.0	0.230503512419	The chances of any litigation proceeding and succeeding on this are zero.
0.0	0.165927147273	And it creates a -- a contempt for the law, for the rule of law.
0.0	0.118533309202	You had only 21 Republican governors in this country.
0.0	0.0816816710109	I am telling the truth.
0.0	0.368072952333	And, you know the old inscription, if you save one life, you've changed the world.
0.0	0.164157918502	I want this bill to be voted down.
0.0	0.215421081305	I'll advertise my Web site as well.
0.0	0.0165577652614	They can't.
0.0	0.27686804588	Now, what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next.
0.0	0.00899393183816	You do the arithmetic.
0.0	0.173865536568	And that's what i hope, there can be some understanding and cooperation to achieve.
0.0	0.195610396279	So with that invocation, let me say a few words.
0.0	0.148305231147	They go to Princeton.
0.0	0.5	So it is possible actually, to find the things that actually work, that we did, increasing drug treatment, using big data to better protect the lives of young people, cut juvenile crime in half, and it's also possible to improve how we police our police.
0.0	0.218038389141	And frankly, if you want to be commander in chief, you have to have the experience.
0.0	0.0527568255203	We all understand that.
0.0	0.41276730938	Heck, find me a Republican in Congress that would cut spending ten dollars.
0.0	0.0775243260378	We can do that.
0.0	0.397542404499	And they've come pretty close to that without federal government assistance.
0.0	0.139495811495	And they're wonderful people.
0.0	0.0515945529102	I will not do that.
0.0	0.29073722781	There is a great deal of skepticism about the federal government.
0.0	0.336052850988	And unlike President Obama, where he refuses even to use the term of what's going on, he can't use the term for whatever reason.
0.0	0.34111454549	If I'm our nominee, I will unite this party and we'll defeat Hillary Clinton and we will turn this country around once and for all, after seven years of the disaster that is Barack Obama.
0.0	0.321879460376	And here in Wisconsin, I want to reiterate: We've got to stand up for unions and working people who have done it before...
0.0	0.351473039786	Now, they do charge you tariff on trucks, when we send trucks and other things over there.
0.0	0.085920970374	Yes.
0.0	0.463323020289	The wages that high school graduates receive today are significantly less, whether you are white or black, than they used to be.
0.0	0.362537094203	What our nation needs right now is to realize that, while we face a terrible danger, we also face a different sort of political danger.
0.0	0.202116569177	They do not want us to exercise religious liberty.
0.0	0.126426744253	...I'm going to go to Washington to stop it...
0.0	0.309743227105	So ladies and gentlemen...I am officially running...... for president of the United States, and we are going to make our country great again.
0.0	0.258358574893	Under that theory, not only would I be disqualified, Marco Rubio would be disqualified, Bobby Jindal would be disqualified and, interestingly enough, Donald J. Trump would be disqualified.
0.0	0.279333240563	Nevertheless, one of the things that I think people don't always understand is how accountable a CEO actually is.
0.0	0.423986288156	ISIS came in, and now occupies significant territory in Libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold.
0.0	0.378294616481	There are a lot of people living paycheck to paycheck in Florida as well, they're looking for a senator that will fight for them each and every day.
0.0	0.388749678118	Well, as you know, I'm a former elected prosecutor, a former elected attorney general, trained at the University of Virginia in constitutional law, and I don't believe in litmus tests except this.
0.0	0.294013381806	It's because I've been assembling a team of people who want to be involved in something that's a little bigger than themselves.
0.0	0.070033959304	If I am elected president...
0.0	0.0875736586157	And it's-- it's a worthy debate.
0.0	0.313778629692	We ought to send used equipment, right?
0.0	0.343489610076	They said they would repeal Obamacare if we gave them the majority.
0.0	0.278814714403	Marco leaves the IRS code in with all of the complexity.
1.0	0.976730904148	Very few children.
0.0	0.190882344665	You know, I have two sons.
0.0	0.240038847239	Well, Neil, I think we've got to work on a two-pronged approach.
0.0	0.50751307362	Barack Obama right now, number one, over seven years, has dramatically degraded our military.
0.0	0.367074607462	If you're running for president of the United States and you do not understand that we cannot defend this nation without more of our soldiers over there, you are not ready for this job.
0.0	0.465944270179	And I'm the only one up on this stage who back in April put forward a detailed entitlement reform plan that will save over $1 trillion, save Social Security, save Medicare, and avoid this -- avoid what Hillary Rodham Clinton will do to you.
0.0	0.267381814032	They send their cars over by the millions, and what do we do?
0.0	0.214480567468	What we could have done if they had said yes would have been a lot more than what we were able to have done.
0.0	0.27488975907	So I put all of this together, again, on my website and I've gotten such a good response.
0.0	0.0363446245918	She's not the threat.
0.0	0.263883960696	Well, let's go with three.
0.0	0.224287100972	And there is no reason that you can't be perfectly fair to the gay community.
0.0	0.423724212086	13 Hours -- tomorrow morning, a new movie will debut about the incredible bravery of the men fighting for their lives in Benghazi and the politicians that abandoned them.
0.0	0.0740509871759	No, that's -- you're wrong.
1.0	0.5	Later that year, in 2004, John Kerry ran for president missing close to 60 to 70 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.356663989607	And, let me now on Social Security because we were getting into a good substantive exchange, and I want to say I think both Chris, and Mike are right.
0.0	0.393282547982	And I'll tell you, Bret, I think that's a much more attractive vision for healthcare than the Washington-drive, top-down Obamacare that is causing so many millions of people to hurt.
0.0	0.373312188662	When was the last time you heard China is killing us?
0.0	0.176896573693	I very much appreciate that comment, Bernie.
0.0	0.29374210557	How can you get people to vote for you?"
0.0	0.405567409452	And, you know, there are a number of programs that I think are duplicative and redundant and not producing the results that people deserve.
0.0	0.392493384018	This is about people's lives, and we should level with the American people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare.
0.0	0.370036378407	So let's support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition.
0.0	0.384409916668	So please, do not explain to me, coming from a state where democratic governors and republican governors have supported virtually no gun control.
0.0	0.305942779713	I said, "I think that number one, I am a nice person.
0.0	0.360771442256	What he said, and he said it in the last debate, it's simply not true.
0.0	0.309460777123	I do not believe that we have to destroy our economy in order to protect our environment.
0.0	0.0812644791375	We have the opposite thinking.
0.0	0.123224724049	Let's keep going.
0.0	0.192063466594	You've got to have a clear vision of where you want to go.
0.0	0.342549991533	Or how about Boeing right here within a mile?
0.0	0.0430364348561	He does great.
0.0	0.385242920707	We have people that are selling this country down the drain.
0.0	0.180341494592	Let's talk about our campaigns.
0.0	0.184131372357	My mother is on Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.426685766883	The better way of dealing with this -- the better way of dealing with this is recognizing that there are people in, you know, the -- Islamic terrorists inside, embedded in refugee populations.
0.0	0.507774017949	And, unlike my two distinguished colleagues on this stage, I actually made college more affordable and was the only state that went four years in a row without a penny's increase to college tuition.
0.0	0.106740880139	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.420440726505	But I do think that her position as promoting women's rights and fairness to women in the workplace, that if what Bill Clinton did any CEO in our country did with an intern, with a 22-year- old, 21-year-old intern in their office, they would be fired.
0.0	0.356163427408	Military action, Maria, would be used when it was absolutely necessary to protect American lives and protect American interests around the world.
0.0	0.310946303602	But if you place good ones, you pocket it.
0.0	0.321659159576	If you want to make it into the middle class -- I'm not saying in all cases -- we need plumbers, and we need carpenters, and electricians, that's for sure, and they should get help as well.
0.0	0.322349918955	People have worked their entire lives.
0.0	0.452510750442	Over the last few weeks, I've listened to Jeb as he walked around the country and said that you're modeling your campaign after John McCain, that you're going to launch a furious comeback the way he did, by fighting hard in New Hampshire and places like that, carrying your own bag at the airport.
0.0	0.29059470483	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.394948484108	Could I -- could I bring something up here, because I'm a constituent of the senator and I helped him and I expected that he would do constituent service, which means that he shows up to work.
0.0	0.221863367678	You know, the Russians wanted to buy time.
0.0	0.173192395201	We never dreamt we'd ever see it."
0.0	0.288247074362	They believe some are smarter than others, some are better than others, so some are going to need to take care of others.
0.0	0.365893434715	Part of the reason why it hasn't risen because sometimes we're not giving people the skills they need.
0.0	0.155258259118	And Teddy Roosevelt is right.
0.0	0.230150607271	They have no plan now."
0.0	0.238286956174	Well, I would just repeat that.
0.0	0.37458238672	The head of Ford will call me back, I would say within an hour after I told them the bad news.
0.0	0.169109142017	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.474699232338	First of all, we have seen now in six years of Obamacare that it has been a disaster.
0.0	0.442966195826	So, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities.
0.0	0.234855201121	Great state, great people.
0.0	0.337024446481	They're gonna spend their $1 billion in Mexico instead.
0.0	0.417403215159	hospital that needs to be improved and made better for them turned over to privatization.
0.0	0.368288138077	And, that will get to the nub of opportunity for our children, and an ability to see wages rise.
0.0	0.394942119463	It's labor, and it's unions good and some bad and lots of people that aren't in unions, and it's all over the place and building all over the world.
0.0	0.0675486812578	That's not true.
0.0	0.362965976775	We have to protect our 2nd amendment and you cannot do this and certainly what Barack Obama was doing with the executive order.
0.0	0.328367470987	We need radical changes in mental health in America so somebody who is suicidal or homicidal can get the emergency care they need.
0.0	0.383386202069	He's got probably a four or five percent chance.
0.0	0.655890543212	No.
0.0	0.0916534249884	But not for us.
0.0	0.264224035679	Well, I am going to answer your question, Neil.
0.0	0.5	He's lost $4,000 in the last seven years in his income because of this administration.
0.0	0.231913769252	Barack Obama was never responsible for those decisions.
0.0	0.242250885486	The second will be to the supreme leader of Iran.
0.0	0.375561805353	Donald, Donald -- can I -- I hope you reconsider this, because this policy is a policy that makes it impossible to build the coalition necessary to take out ISIS.
0.0	0.320071098349	Donald is right that China is running over President Obama like he is a child, President Obama is not protecting American workers and we are getting hammered.
0.0	0.0610208034617	Who denies that it is crazy...
0.0	0.256663309775	You know, John Adams famously said, "facts are are stubborn things."
0.0	0.279791595471	We will arm and train the Kurds.
0.0	0.224508878153	The guy who systematically and habitually violates the constitution on the Supreme Court?
0.0	0.246390522088	The matter is what orders exist now that shouldn't exist?
0.0	0.417039490231	Any connection to the fact that not one Republican candidate for president thinks and agrees with the scientific community that climate change is real and that we have got to transform our energy system?
0.0	0.655890543212	What should we do?
0.0	0.45553284023	Number one, we have to create better paying jobs.
0.0	0.375180021783	It had to be bailed out and it nearly destroyed us.
0.0	0.268502996062	If we don't know who you are, or why you're coming, you will not get into the United States.
0.0	0.369931810197	It has to be with our friends in the Arab world and our friends in Europe, the coalition that we had when we went to the first Gulf War.
0.0	0.157078306965	You don't hear it from anybody else.
0.0	0.217707352007	But what he's touching -- talking about, I think has got merit.
0.0	0.32064464047	But we need an independent investigation, and I hope Secretary Clinton will agree with me for the need of that.
0.0	0.109285336956	When you became president, you had a Democratic Congress and a filibuster-proof Democratic Senate.
0.0	0.459829292154	And every time we give Iraq equipment, the first time a bullet goes off in the air, they leave it.
0.0	0.19551632089	(APPLAUSE) I think that is the -- I think that's the conservative consensus pragmatic approach to how to solve this problem.
0.0	0.246601446101	But it is a general economic issue.
0.0	0.240406199411	So this man tells me about the manufacturing.
0.0	0.288269026993	And we're going to just fix everything with waste, fraud, and abuse?
0.0	0.181971993605	-- the governor's absolutely right.
0.0	0.00430451372677	Thank you.
0.0	0.157268598591	I was a child of Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.213427291369	I made it the old-fashioned way.
0.0	0.363429687219	One, work with the tough men, the dictators, for our own benefit and promote democracy.
0.0	0.253324998071	We've got a president who instead says, we're going to change hearts and minds.
0.0	0.107797171452	Let's listen to them and let's not listen to our politicians.
0.0	0.173710075387	We need to be doing military exercises if not only Estonia but Latvia and Lithuania.
0.0	0.463446113113	They see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on Wall Street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all.
0.0	0.359819506451	It was LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations in this country.
0.0	0.307970792521	We're a country of laws, not of men, not of people who do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.230513868424	I support NAFTA.
0.0	0.188090958356	If you had the court reverse Roe v. Wade, it would become a state issue once again.
0.0	0.155196323123	With all -- with all due respect...
0.0	0.230842585886	They can't even answer simple questions.
0.0	0.264164927211	What we need to do is destroy their ability to attack us here over there, and then get out.
0.0	0.404891761836	But I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost.
0.0	0.0979046870554	You know, I see a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist.
0.0	0.395958053216	I have created tens of thousands of jobs, and I'll be creating many millions of jobs if I'm given -- if I'm given the opportunity to be president.
0.0	0.0909796552186	That's the good news.
0.0	0.422797306205	So, in terms of refugees, I believe that the United States has the moral responsibility with Europe, with Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia to make sure that when people leave countries like Afghanistan and Syria with nothing more than the clothing on their back that, of course, we reach out.
0.0	0.333254508061	Almost every hotel in Atlantic City has either been in bankruptcy or will be in bankruptcy -- the biggest.
0.0	0.550105822303	All the way back to when Ronald Reagan signed a piece of legislation that basically allowed for amnesty for over 4 million people, and the border is still not secure.
0.0	0.280799152035	We've got to stop this culture of government dependence.
0.0	0.427750493073	John, I was the first person on this stage to say that we should accept the 65,000 Syrian refugees that were fleeing the sort of murder of ISIL, and I believe that that needs to be done with proper screening.
0.0	0.127524427372	I'm tired of the hyphenated Americans and the division.
0.0	0.122254132321	And, we come out here, and we do our thing.
0.0	0.40340230247	Prior to that, in the Reagan Library, I gave a detailed plan.
0.0	0.357631744817	That means pass the Paycheck Fairness Act so we have transparency about how much people are making.
0.0	0.341128646075	Our legal immigration system from now on has to be merit-based.
0.0	0.257881506221	If you can encrypt messages, ISIS can, over these platforms, and we have no ability to have a cooperative relationship --
0.0	0.177474430558	They go to Yale.
0.0	0.350835761982	So I think the better approach, the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against China economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage Barack Obama is doing to this economy.
0.0	0.264718291366	You know, I sat down with the senior leadership of John Deere.
0.0	0.104038349792	The Emanuel AME church killings.
0.0	0.187983044606	As you know, because I know you know a lot about health care.
0.0	0.0894803467761	Well, I respectfully disagree.
0.0	0.30694437715	I am the man who can bring us together to do that, and I ask for your vote.
0.0	0.307539999085	There's a reason the NRA gave me their Carter Knight Freedom Fund award...
0.0	0.425349515369	As a former mayor and a former governor, there was never a single day, John, when I went to bed or woke up without realizing that this could happen in our own country.
0.0	0.267393565816	I do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination to succeed President Obama.
0.0	0.405243761241	So many more Americans have been killed by the combination of heroin and these highly addictive pain pills, and yet, we refuse to act.
0.0	0.366159498316	I'm against the kind of inhumane treatment that is now being visited upon families, waking them up in the middle of the night, rounding them up.
0.0	0.375986957764	Maria, I'd like to interrupt this debate on the floor of the Senate to actually answer the question you asked, which was on entitlements.
0.0	0.0928630621043	We have Arab allies.
0.0	0.420757196015	Senator, I have been -- I have been fighting for paid...
0.0	0.377181641196	Well, we've gotta turn the economy around for people who are struggling.
0.0	0.290433868687	We grew up in a three-and-a-half-room, rent controlled apartment in Brooklyn, New York.
1.0	0.470714424725	Every car and every truck and every part manufactured in this plant that comes across the border, we're going to charge you a 35-percent tax, and that tax is going to be paid simultaneously with the transaction, and that's it.
0.0	0.315298417235	And I wrote a book about this called Immigration Wars.
0.0	0.343106895382	I'm hoping that because of the very recent announcement of the agreement at the Security Council, which embodies actually an agreement that I negotiated back in Geneva in June of 2012, we're going to get a diplomatic effort in Syria to begin to try to make a transition.
0.0	0.420861082276	And that's an economy where ordinary Americans are working longer hours for low wagers.
0.0	0.188072344115	Well, let me tell you this.
1.0	0.414337129492	All that's in that trust fund is a pile of IOUs for money they spent on something else a long time ago.
0.0	0.186367249753	I'm not quite the fan of regime change that I believe she is.
0.0	0.315790437549	Obviously, I believe that on a college campus, there should be enough respect so people hear each other.
0.0	0.202822498465	We need money.
0.0	0.116551121176	They were smarter than our leaders.
0.0	0.106311941048	We know about the Brits.
0.0	0.176071921693	We have a country of laws.
0.0	0.182133830945	We lose with ISIS.
0.0	0.0448888314149	They have no choice.
0.0	0.157425060718	There'll be people here that will talk about what they're going to do.
0.0	0.361419702599	You will begin to see jobs created in a robust economy.
0.0	0.200255657124	Well, I'll tell you who is on my side.
0.0	0.318538045401	When people ask me, whose fault is it?
0.0	0.0857398716433	We are mixing apples and oranges.
0.0	0.248136686786	And we need the right people.
0.0	0.270485034927	The people that Washington leaves behind.
0.0	0.0975847813848	Do you know where I'm going, Kevin?
0.0	0.360592157153	I am on the committee that helped write the Affordable Care Act.
0.0	0.470170657104	Every single year close to a million people emigrate to the United States legally.
0.0	0.0926468735664	I will be ready.
0.0	0.422980635825	And number three, we should work to de-link health insurance from employment so if you lose your job, your health insurance goes with you and it is personal, portable and affordable.
0.0	0.196604908408	Today I heard it.
0.0	0.16835863624	I voted yes to suspend that.
0.0	0.0675486812578	That's true.
0.0	0.0237253214909	Neil?
0.0	0.299287788625	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.384401296535	If we are going to be competitive in the global economy we need the best educated workforce.
0.0	0.132000631033	That's was hard work.
0.0	0.32225483177	It will create a manufacturing juggernaut in this country.
0.0	0.209863113159	We actually did it.
0.0	0.220473862095	You target the bad guys.
0.0	0.257595047363	I believe that the goal should be debt-free college.
0.0	0.182655515103	Madam Secretary, that is a low blow.
0.0	0.386355465325	Now, when Secretary Clinton says, "I'm not going raise taxes on the middle class," let me tell you what she is saying.
0.0	0.356812099687	If I'm president of the United States and Congress tries to cut the military, I will veto that in a millisecond.
0.0	0.182384065923	It needs to be repealed and replaced.
0.0	0.235971691726	But I think it is really unfair to suggest that I have not been supportive of the president.
0.0	0.0869059478512	Right.
0.0	0.172051361959	O' Malley: John, please, it's-- personal privilege, John.
0.0	0.429687885537	And, look, I think it's important to look at what the most important counterterrorism judgment of the first four years of the Obama administration was, and that was the very difficult decision as to whether or not to advise the president to go after bin Laden.
0.0	0.311666549084	It's a country in which people choose to buy guns.
0.0	0.284703219836	The time to act is now.
0.0	0.199892444926	That's a serious issue that we could work on.
0.0	0.409844692646	And so, look, the way that -- a stronger middle class is actually the source of economic growth.
0.0	0.295940304978	What the legislation is is $1.61 a week.
0.0	0.344887497251	It's coming from all over South and Latin America, and it's coming probably -- probably -- from the Middle East.
0.0	0.297407204161	I look at the roads being built all over the country, and I say I can build those things for one-third.

0.0	0.655890543212	Again...
0.0	0.149002327079	And it's got to stop and it's got to stop fast.
0.0	0.412708666671	What Reagan did is he began with tax reform and regulatory reform, unleashing the engine of the American free enterprise system.
0.0	0.215446018169	I guess I'm part of the establishment Barbara Bush is my mom.
0.0	0.201998136567	What that is, is just common sense.

0.0	0.183247882941	She led that effort.
0.0	0.0409070346562	Not assets."
0.0	0.337919692961	You know, no public policy doesn't have, in some cases, negative consequences.
0.0	0.193994219466	That will change everything.
0.0	0.0623080744774	We listen to you and -- and then we act.
0.0	0.29486462561	We do not have to have massive levels of income and wealth inequality.
0.0	0.0805294931779	It is not a barbed wire fence.
0.0	0.302855974277	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.199603222826	I absolutely would call on them to collaborate and cooperate, yes.
0.0	0.220351515338	I'm using my own money.
0.0	0.413350945409	Together, leading the world, this country will rid our planet of this barbarous organization called ISIS.
0.0	0.382797971412	It's always a solution of the left to create more Government from the Federal Government.
0.0	0.0951638413654	That makes no sense at all.
0.0	0.140276763121	Let me respond...
0.0	0.288600259021	Because I think frankly, maybe I'm wrong, but on our worst day, I think we have a lot more to offer the American people than the right wing's extremists.
0.0	0.321635851391	So guns have to be looked at as its own problem, but we also have to figure out how we're going to deal with the radicalization here in the United States.
0.0	0.362662207838	And, I would not that there's a much more important government regulation to ethanol, and that's the EPA's blend wall that makes it illegal to sell mid-level blends of ethanol in gasoline.
0.0	0.359508873386	I'd like to just mention something about my tax plan, and how it relates to the discussion...
0.0	0.444250587011	If you saw that blimp that got cut loose from Maryland today, it's a perfect example of government.
0.0	0.18157907222	He has never defended...

0.0	0.318146016617	In terms of my faith, look, all I say is that when I study scripture, I know that people who live in the shadows need to have a chance.
0.0	0.338651385474	We reported excessive force, discourtesy, use of lethal force.
0.0	0.0271343450534	This is a humanitarian catastrophe.
0.0	0.158017553415	Look, the secretary is right.
0.0	0.229342207137	The American people are terrified.
0.0	0.199473876536	But in 2008, we elected a president that didn't want to fix America.
0.0	0.211749907171	Well John, wait a minute.
0.0	0.0503070755256	I love China.
0.0	0.234664881548	But we're always looking for ways about what more we can do to try to give people a chance to be successful.
0.0	0.373167464411	I would want us to take our place among the nations of the world to alleviate this sort of death and the specter we saw of little kids' bodies washing up on a beach.
0.0	0.414796577596	And what we did is try to move that department toward community policing, so that the police officers become part of the community and not, as we see, in some cities an oppressive force.
0.0	0.391390107089	They've contacted the trafficking networks in the Western Hemisphere to get people in through the southern border.
0.0	0.313520383636	And I'll go back to something that had been mentioned just a few minutes ago.
0.0	0.316105425133	But the key thing that we're seeing now is serious challenges to this country that must change, the direction of this nation must change.
0.0	0.219597428266	I said, "I gotta go into Manhattan.
0.0	0.369510594779	In fact, if more border security and these -- and more and more deportations were going to bring our Republican brothers and sisters to the table, it would have happened long ago.
0.0	0.229027869377	People are upset about it.
1.0	0.972108351439	It is also the case that that Rubio-Schumer amnesty bill, one of the things it did is it expanded Barack Obama's power to let in Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.445522361609	I will make sure that we fire the sheer incompetence inside the Department of Veterans Affairs and then we'll give veterans a choice card so that they don't have to travel hours and hours to get care if they want to go to their private provider.
0.0	0.156983196223	It is the future of the world and the future of our children and grandchildren.
0.0	0.218291147364	I had to borrow money to go to school.
0.0	0.472867765138	$2.5 billion, it's going to be one of the largest in the world.
0.0	0.0962479201624	But we stuck to our message.
0.0	0.259803967854	They go back and forth between Syria and this region.
0.0	0.363386625235	I think it's a mistake to create new and more expensive entitlement programs when we can't afford the ones we've got today.
0.0	0.370283178345	And I will be laying out in detail, what I think we need to do with our friends and allies in Europe and elsewhere to do a better job of coordinating efforts against the scourge of terrorism.
0.0	0.30593448689	And what we need to do is bring people together to work on the agreement where there is broad consensus and that's what I intend to do.
0.0	0.345253817748	And I believe people need a leader who is prepared to make tough calls in tough times and stand up...
0.0	0.0757502010852	And that doesn't have to be true.
0.0	0.185435342117	He views himself not simply as the leader of Iran, but as the leader of all Muslims -- all Shia Muslims on the planet.
0.0	0.5	But we have to also go after the gun lobby and 92 percent of Americans agree we should have universal background checks.
0.0	0.437614452723	And we will join the rest of the other -- the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families.
0.0	0.0668745728282	...before I go.
0.0	0.255426084553	The contrast with the Democratic debate, where every fawning question from the media was, "Which of you is more handsome and why?"
0.0	0.188178624023	This is the first priority.
0.0	0.043372144932	That is what I want to do.
0.0	0.154269559332	We've gotten off the Hillary's e-mails, good.
0.0	0.19389830183	I want to take care of women.
0.0	0.0533691188974	But I would add this.
0.0	0.113788646384	I've always listened to you, Megyn.
0.0	0.0921743191178	Let's be frank here.
0.0	0.148170846119	May I respond to the critique on the ...
0.0	0.0665539998692	We are all frustrated with what China is doing.
0.0	0.444322557203	Part of the problem that we have currently in the Middle East is that Assad has hung on to power with the very strong support of Russia and Iran and with the proxy of Hezbollah being there basically fighting his battles.
0.0	0.232843928913	The list goes on because the differences are so stark.
0.0	0.0869059478512	Right.
0.0	0.00430451372677	Thank you.
0.0	0.655890543212	No.
0.0	0.215382789851	Here's the way you need to deal with it.
0.0	0.247993067398	Please become part of the political revolution.
0.0	0.298449311466	This is what's made our nation so special.
0.0	0.14095062292	Well, I don't know.
0.0	0.251723105394	I know how important it is that we have a Democrat succeed President Obama in the White House.
1.0	0.432318136909	In 2008, Barack Obama missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes, and the same newspaper endorsed him again.
0.0	0.0939849095277	You don't have to say that.
0.0	0.0585367215739	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.219619278153	We can re-assume our role in the world.
0.0	0.317138516043	And I'll tell you what, Donald, you -- you very kindly just a moment ago offered me the V.P.
0.0	0.0869059478512	All right.
0.0	0.113004096092	We don't know anything about that.
0.0	0.400267905919	You're going to get it by paying your employees less and charging your customers more, that is a tax, the difference is, you don't see it on the bill.
1.0	0.508874006623	And by the way, when I left, there were over 1 million fewer people on welfare in New York state than when I took office...
0.0	0.492555504361	Well, first, I was critical of the Senators not giving the authorization for the use of military force.
0.0	0.206138459364	I've got a track record.
0.0	0.284270789389	You know, we are the only nation, only developed nation on the planet...
0.0	0.12492381403	Martha, if I may...
0.0	0.10661232739	That's what I think we need to do.
0.0	0.0147182730997	So should the UK, so should France.
0.0	0.338955968546	Teddy Roosevelt said, we are a nation of immigrants.
0.0	0.18132286593	His family certainly believes that.
0.0	0.170875825392	So I think secretary Clinton and I have a fundamental disagreement.
0.0	0.167549854017	I've got five grandkids.
0.0	0.343245095811	Nine months ago, our campaign began.
0.0	0.141473003909	Please reconsider, I'll say no.
0.0	0.14363612275	You want to fix Medicare?
0.0	0.0521487717935	Looking forward to it.
0.0	0.356184981699	Martha, we got a lot of politicians that will kiss babies, cut ribbons, do whatever it takes to be popular.
0.0	0.40500600017	She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video.
0.0	0.429058523647	He pays on his personal rate, and he is paying higher than the big dry-cleaning chain down the street, because he's paying at his personal rate.
0.0	0.234234329879	If you're a Washington lobbyist, if you make your money in and around Washington, things are doing great.
0.0	0.1209304918	I looked into the eyes of Boy Scouts.
0.0	0.205311591306	I just wish he wouldn't misrepresent mine.
0.0	0.282789329817	It's gonna be the best hotel in Washington, D.C. We got it from the General Services Administration in Washington.
0.0	0.228841148396	I don't think anybody should expand Medicaid.
0.0	0.319939738968	Because if your faith causes you to care for the less fortunate, it is something you want to see in your public figures.
0.0	0.195756717293	We're seeing it in my state and we'll see it in this country.
0.0	0.254285339762	But I think it's the right road for us to try to travel.
0.0	0.223977524025	I think we have a disagreement, and the disagreement is that not only did I vote against the war in Iraq.
0.0	0.275980185032	We need to rebuild the military to defeat the enemy.
0.0	0.247565279502	When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best.
0.0	0.0354509810639	And it has been amazing to me.
0.0	0.336419868753	But it doesn't change my view that we need to empower everyone, women and men, to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make.
0.0	0.506128928346	We were one of two states to go to AAA bond rating, and our government spending was far less than the spending in people's income.
0.0	0.199963524554	No, it speaks to the fact that I don't know those --
0.0	0.440921685779	I -- you know, know that Senator Sanders had a different vote than I did when it came to giving immunity to gun makers and sellers.
0.0	0.376718807354	But there is a better way forward than either of those offered by my two opponents here on this stage.
0.0	0.390980754485	Where I see the weakness is in those three people that are left on the Democratic stage.
0.0	0.470400335732	I want to speak to all the moms and dads whose sons and daughters are fighting for this country, and the incredible sense of betrayal when you have a commander-in-chief who will not even speak the name of our enemy, radical Islamic terrorism, when you have a commander-in- chief who sends $150 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, who's responsible for murdering hundreds of our servicemen and women.
0.0	0.19619407513	We both listened to the information from Bush and Cheney.
0.0	0.27120282515	I want to build on and improve the Affordable Care Act.
0.0	0.00430451372677	Thank you.
0.0	0.222111841167	Let me conclude by just saying this.
0.0	0.31748351453	I want to get ahead of those, and that's why I've proposed a much more comprehensive approach to deal with all of these...
0.0	0.0360370272821	So I'm doing great.
0.0	0.119032203078	I will begin tomorrow to filibuster it.
0.0	0.655890543212	But...
0.0	0.228522767356	And here's the last piece...
0.0	0.655890543212	So...
0.0	0.0863210424714	Why didn't they call?
0.0	0.455426512454	I led the effort, unfortunately unsuccessfully, against deregulation because I knew when you merge large insurance companies and investment banks and commercial banks it was not going to be good.
0.0	0.170484429634	And I believe he is absolutely right.
0.0	0.0775243260378	I can do that.
0.0	0.377068729132	They're leaving because of taxes, but they are also leaving because they can't get their money back and everybody agrees, Democrats and Republicans, that is should come back in.
0.0	0.384334406534	We don't have enough competition and we don't have enough oversight of what the insurance companies are charging everybody right now.
0.0	0.256965566114	You know, before it was called Obamacare, it was called Hillarycare.
0.0	0.431804264791	But unlike either of these two fine people, I've actually balanced a budget every single year.
0.0	0.189141079236	I don't want immigration reform to fail.
0.0	0.449761365106	It means that we have to rethink the so-called war on drugs which has destroyed the lives of millions of people, which is why I have taken marijuana out of the Controlled Substance Act.
0.0	0.180970016722	I understand we can disagree on the path forward.
0.0	0.255155469073	And when I look at Washington today, we need to bring us together.
0.0	0.199230501191	Why didn't they call the police?
0.0	0.420209757273	Why is it that the United States of America today is the only major country on earth that does not guarantee health care to all people as a right?
0.0	0.136595962438	You know, Ted didn't show up.
0.0	0.303334341682	Here's what I would do Neil, I would appoint an Attorney General and I would have one very brief conversation with that Attorney General.
0.0	0.464976375071	But there is no substitute for having comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship for 11 million people, many of whom have known no other country but the United States of America.
0.0	0.269661368962	And you think about the reasons that we're having such difficulty right now with our job market.
0.0	0.05594548273	Yeah, but look.
0.0	0.655890543212	No, you did.
0.0	0.453741276132	And I will assure you, as the governor of the state of Texas, and as those last four years have shown me, the preparation to be ready to stand on this stage and talk about those monetary policies, those domestic policies, and those foreign policies, Americans are going to see that I am ready to be that individual.
0.0	0.29542934814	They're not going to turn into stockbrokers overnight or open up a chain of car washes.
0.0	0.264553742505	Well, I got it for two reasons.
0.0	0.239258699919	And I ended a federal entitlement.
0.0	0.0549639069543	And, thank you everybody.
0.0	0.121003796343	I was mentioned in the question.
0.0	0.526618178055	I voted against it because the Southern Poverty Law Center, among other groups, said that the guest-worker programs that were embedded in this agreement were akin to slavery.
0.0	0.427454748276	So what I will tell you about our incentives -- our incentives are tight, and at the end of the day we make sure that we gain more from the creation of jobs than what we lose.
0.0	0.306797053815	You know, I completely agree with Senator Sanders.
1.0	0.485358154529	$5 billion we spent on a Web site, and to this day it doesn't work.
0.0	0.0197792473436	(APPLAUSE)
1.0	0.440098871497	A $5 billion Web site.
0.0	0.0550782031163	I'm in competition with them.
0.0	0.391829494439	Now hundreds of companies I've opened.
0.0	0.404617511545	And I'm the only candidate on this stage to put forward a new agenda for America's cities so we can employ more people in the heart of great American cities and get them back to work.
0.0	0.366685849851	We can end sanctuary cities by cutting off...
0.0	0.357035979819	But the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, it's to understand what happens the day after.
0.0	0.14615955646	Nobela (ph) is a rising entrepreneur.
0.0	0.164635573695	... replacing dependency with opportunity.
0.0	0.0585367215739	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.251446764976	David, there are wider vulnerabilities than when it comes to refugees.
0.0	0.13245147615	It never happens.
0.0	0.335083163549	They need to be defeated militarily, and that will take overwhelming U.S. force.
0.0	0.120162280086	I said, "Very interesting."
0.0	0.424062278447	Regulations in this country are out of control, especially the Employment Prevention Agency, the EPA, and all of the rules they continue to impose on our economy and hurting us.
0.0	0.225111015169	But the facts and the law here are really quite clear.
0.0	0.0584956533979	You can't do nothing.
0.0	0.273778337	And, in my opinion, the new China, believe it or not, in terms of trade, is Mexico.
0.0	0.438475853695	You save it by making the United States, by making us rich again, by taking back all of the money that's being lost.
0.0	0.316935190457	You see, because if you really want to get to a balanced budget, you need to reduce your expenses and you need to grow your economy.
0.0	0.207545024997	On the issue of Barack Obama, Barack Obama does not believe that America is a great global power.
0.0	0.00221671661437	That's the negotiator we have.
0.0	0.0457868891098	Okay.
0.0	0.145120487762	I couldn't talk to anybody about it.
0.0	0.162229059781	This president -- and, by the way, Secretary Clinton, who called Assad a reformer -- she called Assad a reformer.
0.0	0.133570142852	There's a lot packed into that statement.
0.0	0.2716632867	Rand's amendment was not the right way to do it.
0.0	0.338727054808	I've heard them talk about deporting 10 or 11 -- people here from this country out of this country, splitting families.
1.0	0.405146586071	We are the only major country on Earth that doesn't guarantee healthcare to all people.
0.0	0.245683197203	Iran is taking over Iraq, and they're taking it over big league.
0.0	0.179220747023	I beat China all the time.
0.0	0.376839219425	There are a lot of training programs and education programs that I think can be streamlined and put into a much better format so that if we do continue them they can be more useful, in public schools, community colleges, and colleges and universities.
0.0	0.236765393693	Maria, I'd just like to say...

0.0	0.394344110693	Clearly the best piece of veterans' legislation brought forth in decades.
0.0	0.32173738357	You can campaign, or just resign and let someone else take the job.
0.0	0.19901122678	And I say, look, it's not Republicans' fault, it's not Democrats' fault, it's your grandparents' fault for having too many damn kids.
0.0	0.332046341003	What I did in New York was bring people together, an overwhelmingly Democratic state.
0.0	0.416211823881	Through stupidity, in a very, very hard core prison, interestingly named Clinton, two vicious murderers, two vicious people escaped, and nobody knows where they are.
0.0	0.13849004067	You gotta be creative and imaginative.
0.0	0.366842459171	China, you go there now, roads, bridges, schools, you never saw anything like it.
0.0	0.257632612758	That's the issue that we need to tackle as Americans, and we can do it and we know how.
0.0	0.316827162743	We differ, however, on a couple of key points.
0.0	0.00657879709171	...Chris...
0.0	0.34066047411	That's the difference, and that's the kind of leader we need in the White House.
0.0	0.0590606227483	You count on it.
0.0	0.334450243531	Someone's going to be collecting this tax.
0.0	0.333179147837	Sit down with people like Jeff Miller, the Republican chairman of the house, and work on a bill.
0.0	0.261010196413	This is a guy who just believes that law enforcement are the bad guys.
0.0	0.213379617808	They didn't know the room was too big, because they didn't have anybody there.
0.0	0.185960588088	You can change your mind.
0.0	0.260075576274	We've already got a great talker in the White House.
0.0	0.391557807193	It is Hillary, it is Biden, it is the others who insist on allowing abortion well into viable (inaudible) wrong, and that should be stopped.
0.0	0.0958474629645	Hey, I'm not saying they're stupid.
0.0	0.0791658608569	We had Hezbollah.
0.0	0.218976006598	Are they going to stand with us against this kind of jihadi radicalism or not?
0.0	0.206942335922	And ISIS is attacking France and attacking Russian airliners.
0.0	0.471740730706	So while other candidates will talk about the things they would like to do, I actually got these things done in a state that defended not only a AAA bond rating, but the highest median income in America.
0.0	0.23444470859	So, I've laid out a five-point plan about what we can do together.
0.0	0.299914040396	... No, I said I do not support blanket amnesty...
0.0	0.100789039288	What are you going to do for my kids?
0.0	0.434744622077	In all due respect, Secretary Clinton, a lot of the progressive groups, the online groups have really asked you a simple question.
0.0	0.315378226867	They worked hard to provide us the chance at a better life.
1.0	0.985454338255	My price tag is about $100 billion a year.
0.0	0.248245779744	Look, first of all, I recognize that Vladimir Putin is an opportunist and he's a bully, and we have to face him down.
0.0	0.23721459952	I look at Washington, and I hear the talk, and I see the promises and it seems nothing ever changes.
0.0	0.329691065398	And now, like never before, we need our Muslim American neighbors to stand up and to -- and to be a part of this.
0.0	0.0497481647577	I would prioritize them.
0.0	0.170405422657	That's what he talked about, the great threat of China.
0.0	0.0109382915112	No, you weren't.
0.0	0.369538138393	That's why John McCain, even though he was born in Panama, was eligible to run for president.
0.0	0.283679915995	Because Obama and Clinton policies, the United States is moving further and further into a decline.
0.0	0.346889816357	We want to destroy ISIS, it has to be in the air and on the ground.
0.0	0.0740509871759	They're not wrong.
0.0	0.239728553463	She put American strategy at risk for her convenience.
0.0	0.223610149988	You've got to be on top of it.
0.0	0.0532006344594	So I would say, "Congratulations.
0.0	0.0833562882533	We're dying.
0.0	0.370003727986	I've created tens of thousands of jobs, and in all due respect -- and actually some of these folks I really like a lot -- but I'm the only one that can say that.
0.0	0.484193553609	Just last week, we see saw two Iraqi refugees vetted using the same process the president says will work, that were arrested for being alleged ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.274243461469	Yeah, I would go, first of all, one step further in this description of Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.321793258887	Bill after coming home from Japan, flying 33 missions.
0.0	0.253453949291	Maybe we would've gotten a deal where we didn't give everything away.
0.0	0.392995112092	If even in Paris, if they had guns on the other side, going in the opposite direction, you wouldn't have 130 people plus dead.
1.0	0.98299276482	And then we decided we could bring $14 billion of our money -- I mean, Washington doesn't have any money.
0.0	0.439544054216	What these Chaldean families told me was that their families in Syria, when ISIS moves into their town, they actually paint a red cross across the door and mark their homes for demolition, and that tells the family you'd better get out now.
0.0	0.218332043516	Let me just say this...
0.0	0.377285548299	And we finally have a U.N. Security Council Resolution bringing the world together to go after a political transition in Syria.
0.0	0.271716823647	That the Ayatollah is a radical jihadist who really means it when he chants, "Death to America, death to Israel."
0.0	0.346932182845	You know I understand why Donald made the comments he did and I understand why Americans are feeling frustrated and scared and angry when we have a president who refuses to acknowledge the threat we face and even worse, who acts as an apologist for radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.414961687685	When you ran in 2000, you said that we needed federal robust regulations.
0.0	0.157317123437	We're running surpluses.
0.0	0.394677127919	So conservatives actually do come out of Manhattan, including William F. Buckley and others, just so you understand.
0.0	0.433279096353	When I am president, I will work consistently every single day to keep this country safe, not call Edward Snowden, as you did, a great public servant.
0.0	0.36909536794	Why don't we just give a chicken in every pot, while we're, you know, coming up -- coming up with these fantasy tax schemes.
0.0	0.453464996039	It was also the disbanding of many elements of the Iraqi army that are now showing up as part of ISIS.
0.0	0.37122007658	I have seen him appoint people to our courts not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.5	To get deregulated -- listen to this, they spent $5 billion in lobbying and campaign contributions over a 10-year period.
0.0	0.119027621326	Look, I served on...
0.0	0.262825271293	You know, I think most people know exactly what New York values are.
0.0	0.265557412673	Yeah (ph), no, I think that's a -- that's a huge mistake, to be closing down mosques.
0.0	0.283693150491	And I was there when we went into the Gulf War.
0.0	0.0619487073131	I don't blame Hillary Clinton at all for this.
0.0	0.191904660892	Well, as anyone knows who's been listening to me, you know?
0.0	0.259680486293	But I had to stand up and come back and get the best that we could.
0.0	0.241633905323	I think Bernie Sanders is good candidate for president of Sweden.
0.0	0.26338693033	I've got the scars to show from the effort back in the early '90s.
0.0	0.207276352016	And that's just not acceptable.
0.0	0.27228591204	But if you want someone to drive you home, I will get the job done and I will get you home.
0.0	0.494825310832	Ted said he was for NSA reform, but then he told Marco Rubio, no, no, no, I voted for the bill because I'm for the government collecting 100 percent of your cell phone records.
0.0	0.299773294296	But let me just say that we also need down -- to tear down the cyber walls that China is erecting, that Russia is erecting.
0.0	0.488800217146	By the time I left, the average tax burden on Maryland families was the same as when I started.
0.0	0.115154356756	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.280448928095	Look, we don't know what's going to happen in ten months.
0.0	0.170478866152	I mean, you know, let's not be naive about it.
0.0	0.241199498872	And, I'll tell you one other thing, you know why the Republican party will want to take a chance on me?
0.0	0.409841132914	So if -- if people who are in the private sector know what I stand for, it's what I fought for as a senator, it's what I will do as president, and they want to be part of once again building our economy so it works for everybody, more power to them, because they are the kind of business leaders who understand that if we don't get the American economy moving and growing, we're not going to recognize our country and we're not going to give our kids the same opportunities that we had.
0.0	0.0125643725845	... an agreement with the...
0.0	0.466689102136	I have a strategy to combat and defeat ISIS without getting us involved in another ground war, and I have plans to raise incomes and deal with a lot of the problems that keep families up at night.
0.0	0.210111079277	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.154480629062	And wherever you are sitting Nikki, I'm a friend.
0.0	0.357552542539	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.314688234734	As far as Mark is concerned, as far as the visas are concerned, if we need people, they have -- it's fine.
0.0	0.333608561385	And we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid.
0.0	0.510216303752	And it's why I've continued to focus on the fact that we need to declare war on the four big cost drivers because 80 percent of all medical costs in this country are chronic disease.
0.0	0.0515945529102	I will...
0.0	0.186097428198	I was the governor during the 9/11 attack when the Pentagon was struck.
0.0	0.298260395086	The issue is -- I believe, and I believe this honestly, and I don't know that there's much difference on guns between us.
0.0	0.284567343544	That is the way to deal with China at the end of the day.
0.0	0.0363353008854	Thank you, Marco.
0.0	0.442053967369	And, sometimes we're held up in contempt by people who write columns, but, I guarantee you to every person on this stage there's something deep inside of us that would cause us to give up our livelihoods and step out on this stage and fight for the people of America.
0.0	0.265207951198	She put America's secrets at risk for her convenience.
0.0	0.275825454155	And kind of -- that's what I see our campaign is about right now.
0.0	0.277786354524	And just so -- if I could, because he insulted a lot of people.
0.0	0.0295057926174	I wish he was here.
0.0	0.44978504301	But we can do is defund Planned Parenthood, and by the way, put in place an absolute permanent ban on any taxpayer dollars ever being used to fund abortions.
0.0	0.288149867712	Big government favors the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected, and crushes the small and the powerless.
1.0	0.974563389199	Middle class in this country for the last 40 years has been disappearing; are we better of today then we were when Bush left office?
0.0	0.369574465694	23 million files in the hands of the Chinese?
0.0	0.431366886833	It'll produce enormous economic growth, and it eliminates every mandate, every subsidy, so there's no subsidies for oil and gas, no subsidies for anyone.
0.0	0.370705277113	The cybersecurity challenges that we face, this administration failed us completely, completely.
0.0	0.19739929833	This isn't -- this isn't, you know, a different kind of job.
0.0	0.30943322897	In the same light, as the foreign leader, Winston Churchill's politics were not my politics.
0.0	0.388258543069	Health savings accounts are something that we introduced.
0.0	0.296523677432	And that is the danger that democracies find themselves susceptible to when unscrupulous leaders try to turn us upon each other.
0.0	0.392573645526	We will use those proceeds, a hundred billion a year, to invest in rebuilding our infrastructure.
0.0	0.288025182013	We have a stock market that, frankly, has been good to me, but I still hate to see what's happening.
0.0	0.232338167771	Now, he's doing better.
0.0	0.397402358215	If you send a tie or a shirt made in China into the United States and an American goes to buy it at the store and there's a tariff on it, it gets passed on in the price to price to the consumer.
0.0	0.330592085529	That is why we need to make police -- and I speak as a former mayor.
0.0	0.0496568339342	You bet they do.
0.0	0.399579244926	I inherited a state in New Jersey that was downtrodden, and beaten by liberal democratic policies, high taxation, high regulation.
0.0	0.2761200455	And if this humanitarian crisis increases, we should accept more.
0.0	0.414849751502	But I think there has to be recognition that if we -- if we are too punitive, then you'll go to other -- other technology companies outside the United States.
0.0	0.291874419596	... and we will end the illegal immigration.
0.0	0.251668504311	So for me, it is looking at what works and what we need to do to try to move past what happened in '08.
0.0	0.196051483993	What have you got now?
0.0	0.366182745229	It puts us on a level, even playing field, which brings jobs here at home...
0.0	0.299992453315	Martha, religious liberty doesn't include encouraging a fellow American to engage in violent jihad and kill an American here.
0.0	0.152417706344	I'm looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.357309274828	You look at these airports, we are like a third world country.
0.0	0.111600713797	Folks, you want to --
0.0	0.655890543212	Have to do it.
0.0	0.0533606937096	Here's what I'd do.
0.0	0.281135657374	Meantime, wages have stagnated for 40 years.
0.0	0.169320820033	All right, look, this has been a great debate.
0.0	0.321814950133	I don't think it's a war on women for all of us as Americans to stand up and stop harvesting organs from little babies.
0.0	0.284192738692	Look, we need more Americans to be involved in the political process.
0.0	0.206612900104	Many businessmen want to endorse me.
0.0	0.154205918555	And we will be strong again.
0.0	0.118264884936	Caesar's -- excuse me -- Caesar's, the Rolls-Royce, as you know, is in bankruptcy.
0.0	0.203897069284	So what if mass unemployment exists?
0.0	0.442569598825	If they hear people running for president who basically shortcut it to say we are somehow against Islam, that was one of the real contributions, despite all the other problems, that George W. Bush made after 9/11 when he basically said after going to a Mosque in Washington, we are not at war with Islam or Muslims.
1.0	0.973039524582	When I ran in 1999, David, for mayor of Baltimore, our city by that year had become the most addicted, violent, and abandoned in America.
0.0	0.105996590244	I came to Washington, D.C. in 1990.
0.0	0.353555904133	Thirdly, we need to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to send a serious signal that we're back in the game with Israel --
0.0	0.179786608374	They serve in the military.
0.0	0.187820067162	It was designed with Iowa's own Congressman Steve King and Jeff Sessions, and...
0.0	0.368943917695	Nobody wants to watch three and a half, or three hours.
0.0	0.224078562777	You know, I think my biggest weakness is exactly the opposite.
0.0	0.261361215346	We need to come together as a country because we have to realize that America is great, not from the top-down.
0.0	0.443950315611	John, the world is a very dangerous place, but the world is not too dangerous of a place for the United States of America, provided we act according to our principles, provided we act intelligently.
0.0	0.301718611635	Kissinger was one of those people during the Vietnam era who talked about the domino theory.
0.0	0.290067296899	Are you concerned like I am that the debt and deficits of Washington, D.C. are endangering America's future?
0.0	0.300424657077	People were just being fined to death.
0.0	0.0905830302131	You have to lead.
0.0	0.209815926947	And, this is what I am finding throughout America.
0.0	0.137845642516	Super PACs are a disaster.
0.0	0.0796934597927	And I'm confident we can do that.
0.0	0.398255746686	You know, just two weeks ago was the 25th anniversary of the first Persian Gulf war.
0.0	0.143324486086	... who got us out of that...
1.0	0.389480403568	John -- John, this country today has more income and wealth inequality than any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.209863113159	We actually did it.
0.0	0.278982045642	I sell tens' of millions of (inaudible).
0.0	0.217527209146	Sit down with people like John Mccain.
0.0	0.412438038734	And there are 48 million people involved -- 40 million, 65 and over, and 8 million other.
0.0	0.31012744396	People are waking up because it is going to be us who will determine the direction of our country.
0.0	0.0514366598588	Everybody should.
0.0	0.276933449834	That is exactly what I just said and what I just described.
0.0	0.353108105411	I think the United States military is operating under rules of engagement that are too strict...
0.0	0.391998695485	Why does the pharmaceutical industry make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.289232390037	If you're a farmer, if you're a rancher, if you are small business owner, the death tax is gone.
0.0	0.206855971409	But with all our problems with Russia, with all our problems with everything -- everything, they got away with it again.
0.0	0.267164624397	Now, what the magic number is, I don't know, because we don't know the extent of the problem.
0.0	0.400961714233	And I'll tell you who supported my amendment -- Jeff Sessions, the strongest opponent of amnesty in the United States Congress.
0.0	0.0745453942142	And you know what?
0.0	0.102959726356	And I apologize to nobody for that.
1.0	0.969987922879	You used to say that you were in favor of birthright citizenship, now you say that you are against it.
0.0	0.224872724301	I have Ryan Tannehill, Marco, as my quarterback, he was 18 for 19 last week.
0.0	0.454358361346	I think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether it's poison in the water of the children of Flint, or whether it's the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the LGBT community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, that's what I want to take on.
0.0	0.655890543212	And why?
0.0	0.214107359965	We used to win, we don't win anymore.
0.0	0.137599686275	And I could say, oh, I'm not angry.
0.0	0.414795883398	I have been tried under many different emergencies and I can tell you that in each of those emergencies, whether they were inflicted by drug gangs, whether they were natural emergencies, I knew how to lead and I knew how to govern because I know how to manage people in a crisis and be very clear about the goal of protecting human life.
0.0	0.429333746305	I think the other problem is we have a legal immigration system that's outdated, it's primarily based on whether you have family members living here.
0.0	0.201282188833	A bipartisan approach got close.
0.0	0.361238878947	I said we should go to 65, but only if we have as careful a screening and vetting process as we can imagine, whatever resources it takes because I do not want us to, in any way, inadvertently allow people who wish us harm to come into our country.
0.0	0.261737213912	We only have one or two.
0.0	0.348624820906	They come from another country and they're immediately sent out.
0.0	0.428305634876	So, yes, I do believe that when we talk about public education in America, today, in a rapidly changing world, we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities.
0.0	0.284188166914	Well, that has not been a part of most of the proposals that I've seen.
0.0	0.288689072681	We took it away from the NSA, it was a bad decision by the president.
0.0	0.0744721060445	We have a -- they say there's no bipartisanship in Washington?
1.0	0.968715857809	He put a 25 million dollar check up from his own pocket to fund that campaign and my wife Heidi and I, we ended up investing everything we owned.
0.0	0.430101788266	Look, I am deeply concerned about what's happening in every community in America, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths.
0.0	0.342778736409	... that suspends all refugees from nations that ISIS or Al Qaida controls significant territory.
0.0	0.0696748951383	That's what should be done.
0.0	0.290822503156	That's real moral authority that we need in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.0226720661381	Yeah.
0.0	0.137076588054	But I want to be frank about what I stand for.
0.0	0.463006693316	He launched Fast and Furious, illegally selling guns to Mexican drug lords that were then used to shoot law enforcement officials.
1.0	0.987883986428	It is the biggest job-killer in this country.
0.0	0.182622635236	I hope Congress says no to this deal.
0.0	0.655890543212	But...
0.0	0.130547295693	... his answer -- you name it.
0.0	0.0775243260378	I can.
0.0	0.357987016796	And I propose a block grant program that will keep the states in the game as well.
0.0	0.145412771745	And we do have to form a coalition.
0.0	0.00430451372677	Thank you.
0.0	0.294771641977	We ought to send some real junk, because, frankly, it would be -- we ought to send our surplus.
0.0	0.387656829609	I believe in action in which we put together a strong coalition of forces, major powers and the Muslim nations.
0.0	0.170061539632	I know the good ones.
0.0	0.449245092897	We need to make the government run smarter and better, and reform this corporate tax system, bring that money back to the United States to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, and we need to use it also to protect our grid from terrorists.
0.0	0.185613743849	I would call up the head of Ford, who I know.
0.0	0.402471185224	Not only were we the first state in the nation to pass a living wage.
0.0	0.114428533951	Because -- because Donald's mother was born in Scotland.
0.0	0.294552692014	So this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle.
0.0	0.282435442482	By actually doing more for education.
0.0	0.248104596609	You know, they feel like if they don't have a lobbyist, if they're not wealthy, that somehow they don't get to play.
0.0	0.0745453942142	We know...
0.0	0.275170617676	And so if there's someone in that organization, and it turns out there was, who was willing to be able to do that, that's what we should do.
0.0	0.0860420039728	The domino theory, you know, if Vietnam goes, China, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.
0.0	0.188208855888	We were proud of them on graduation day, weren't we, Katie?
0.0	0.0948123817438	I like them.
0.0	0.217676522101	I've got one more question for you then.
0.0	0.25078504404	I gotta build those big buildings.
0.0	0.352392887589	You've seen middle-class wages go backwards $3,700 during the Obama administration.
0.0	0.433505820026	Well, first, Judy, I have spent my entire adult life working toward making sure that women are empowered to make their own choices, even if that choice is not to vote for me.
0.0	0.288360125158	You know, we probably have to figure out a way to make sure that we keep America safe.
0.0	0.186239440823	I want to talk to the folks at home.
0.0	0.31659627503	It's the most exceptional country the world has ever known.
1.0	0.953309794232	Mossadegh back in 1953.
0.0	0.287204630461	Well, you've got to be on top of it right away.
0.0	0.343835196627	Well, of course, each of these cases needs to be looked at individually and analyzed.
0.0	0.341098082773	So I believe that working with Europe -- and, by the way, you know, we've got some very wealthy countries there in that part of the world.
1.0	0.974418691167	And if you tax cuts -- if you cut taxes for corporations, and you cut taxes for individuals, you're going to make things move, particularly the corporate tax, which is the highest, of course, in the -- in the world.
0.0	0.349928607071	All young people who have the ability should be able to get a college education.
0.0	0.407944660531	We're going to cut Medicare and Medicaid, federal aid to education to help you, because the government is so terrible.
0.0	0.544492945868	So yes, I will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year pay zero, zero in federal income tax.
0.0	0.154211296207	My budget was mentioned.
0.0	0.267121972169	But I think we have got to get our foreign policies and priorities right.
0.0	0.403291296818	I believe that our Federal Government needs to do more on pell grants.
0.0	0.142742336825	If we do that again, we will lose again, we will deserve to lose again.
0.0	0.0595718124479	That's 13,000 miles.
0.0	0.242549197124	And believe me, you look at the border with Yemen.
0.0	0.288342905252	Got 70 votes in the United States Senate.
0.0	0.0912284873826	It feels different.
0.0	0.392095333173	Let me tell you what I would do immediately, day two in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.175094519138	I think he'll be a great cheerleader for the country.
0.0	0.221915975152	Nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with.
0.0	0.455825573739	And in that meeting, I suggested we had a problem with technology, and that I wanted to take people from Silicon Valley into the Pentagon to solve our most significant problems.
0.0	0.384721542864	I'm very proud of the fact that we have more than 750 thousand donors, and the vast majority of them are giving small contributions.
0.0	0.389812725036	I was on morning Joe at a town hall and a young student stood up and said, "Can I still be idealistic?"
0.0	0.264208791136	As it relates to the super PACs, I have no control over that.
1.0	0.403313976759	Well, we have an authorization to use military force against terrorists.
0.0	0.255700172943	They are our first line of defense.
0.0	0.109176808597	I do respect Rand.
0.0	0.2604438127	We are a better country than this.
0.0	0.394370538577	We lose with one of the worst deals I've ever seen negotiated of any kind, that's our recent catastrophe with Iran.
0.0	0.368459870237	So, I think we've got to understand the complexity of the world that we are facing and no place is more so than in the Middle East.
0.0	0.139384958057	And I'm glad that I have a chance to answer this question.
0.0	0.0602101817709	I'm happy to have him tonight...
0.0	0.205681146296	So let's start -- let's start with immigration.
0.0	0.174087856489	Fiscal discipline, know what you're doing.
0.0	0.109922761286	I was not the secretary of state...
0.0	0.0906170447809	They have infrastructure.
0.0	0.272742886429	Here is the major issue when we talk about Wall Street.
0.0	0.430752368238	We need an economy that works for the middle class, not just a handful of billionaires, and I will fight and lead to make that happen.
0.0	0.429897873952	The reason that I -- I hate them so much is because every single regulation costs in terms of goods and services.
0.0	0.27505766751	And, you know, that's been my message in New Hampshire.
0.0	0.233777966999	That's how I focused from the beginning of the campaign and it is how I intend to continue going forward.
0.0	0.330303907139	And also, I've been tested in a way no one else has.
0.0	0.240380963433	Well, first of all, thank you all for having us.
0.0	0.216435632371	The talk has got to stop, the action has got to begin.
0.0	0.176409023725	They don't even have a chance.
0.0	0.0675486812578	It's true.
0.0	0.372514196904	We know (ph) to go ahead and shut off the supply routes, and send in our special ops at 2:00 a.m. and attack them everywhere they go.
0.0	0.175070288517	He's penalized -- and doesn't understand.
0.0	0.432886229237	The caliphate of ISIS has to be destroyed, which means we need to arm directly to Kurds, imbed our troops with the Iraqi military, re engage with the Sunni tribal leaders.
0.0	0.243789847649	Actually a close friend.
0.0	0.266341450824	I think God has blessed this country with enormous natural resources, and we should pursue all of the above.
0.0	0.174365447996	Let me just...
0.0	0.201421204	And I think together we will make progress.
0.0	0.0869059478512	Right.
0.0	0.175613830607	Yes, let's tell the truth, Martin.
0.0	0.465929500934	That would fix the problem, and also allow, for those 11 million people who are here illegally, a legal status, with citizenship off the table.
0.0	0.154698026165	I have a bill to fix Medicare.
0.0	0.394830836206	So, we're talking about -- we're talking about reform for people like me and people like Senator Cruz, as he talked about earlier, who are years away from retirement that have a way to plan for these changes, and way that's very reasonable.
0.0	0.0525392901196	And God bless America.
0.0	0.263363014178	That's essentially what we have now, and we don't need that.
0.0	0.106291855935	So they put together this.
0.0	0.0595710654997	It's good to be with you.
0.0	0.120291081579	Judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.466077448172	We created 2,000 new jobs in the solar industry and we fought every single day to adopt more inclusive economic practices.
0.0	0.359838992961	I will take her on, and when I take her on I guarantee you one thing, she will never get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.399539966697	Well, John, I think that we have to look at ISIS as the leading threat of an international terror network.
0.0	0.567481769047	We're spending over $600 billion a year on the military and yet, significantly less than 10 percent of that money is used to be fighting international terrorism.
0.0	0.211232051859	We have to work with NATO to protect Eastern Europe against any kind of Russian aggression.
0.0	0.422647573151	It just needs a corporate executive type at the top that's done it before.
0.0	0.304854414723	She is still defending Planned Parenthood, and she is still her party's frontrunner.
0.0	0.200424151344	Ted can change his mind.
0.0	0.5	Now, as far as the renewable fuel standard is concerned, certain promises were made, certain government contracts were issued which extend all the way into the year 2022, and I believe that it's probably unfair to withdraw the rug because people have invested money.
0.0	0.384345140522	I think it's fair to say that Baltimore is not now one of the safest cities in America, but the issue is...
0.0	0.223501077165	They're a feeding frenzy for sick people.
0.0	0.356846846801	John, I had the honor of being chairman of the U.S. Senate committee on Veterans' Affairs for two years.
0.0	0.283796400083	Well, one of us ran against Barack Obama.
0.0	0.188372665827	First of all...
0.0	0.268621280045	If, heaven forbid, that next president is a Republican, I think it's pretty clear we know what will happen.
0.0	0.283213594732	In terms of 2007 immigration reform, yeah, I did vote against it.
0.0	0.106419614721	And that's really a theme of a lot of the things that I'm talking about.
0.0	0.185520373107	Do people not care about all of our sacrifice?
1.0	0.968651407161	They are going to people showing videos of Donald Trump insulting Islam and Muslims in order to recruit more radical jihadists.
0.0	0.149967625988	They're a mile away from here.
0.0	0.0675486812578	No, it's true.
0.0	0.0778100902289	They shouldn't be going to Europe.
0.0	0.446284594117	Let me say first that it is disturbing that every time one of these home-grown terrorist attacks occurs, and, as your question points out, they are occurring with far too great frequency, it turns out we had warning signals.
0.0	0.279750395023	Crony capitalism is what happens when government gets so big and so powerful that only the big and the powerful can handle it.
0.0	0.440098871497	$5 billion Web site.
0.0	0.431423161961	Thousands of people killed, and the cleanup started the next day, and it was the most horrific cleanup, probably in the history of doing this, and in construction.
0.0	0.362422584335	Social Security, which Republicans call a Ponzi scheme, may face privatization.
0.0	0.390938221548	But, of course, international terrorism is a major issue that we have got to address today.
0.0	0.29103335562	And what we said is, if they're going to impose this on us, we better prepare to protect the state from it.
0.0	0.310547138519	By the way, unlike our country where we're totally predictable and the enemy, whether it's ISIS or anybody else, they know exactly what we're doing because we have the wrong leadership.
1.0	0.94933767863	Well, I would certainly build on the successes of the Affordable Care Act and work to fix some of the glitches that you just referenced.
0.0	0.280915334933	This nation is the most powerful military in the world.
0.0	0.245084940424	Look, under President Obama and Secretary Clinton, they're working hard to change the American dream into the European nightmare.
0.0	0.168657788219	And I was proud to stand with him and support it.
0.0	0.13982523311	And guess what, in 2011, I got a deal...
0.0	0.284025170158	This is not the type of campaign that we run.
0.0	0.176584222434	I need your help.
0.0	0.159377517624	The fact is, there is a big overhang.
0.0	0.198196363361	So they clearly think I'm going to do what I say I will do and you can look at what I did in the Senate.
0.0	0.270453041922	They knew they were talking about the issues of attacking people, Megyn.
0.0	0.180957641366	The economy was really booming.
0.0	0.26476947692	Watching this broadcast tonight are millions of people that are living paycheck to paycheck.
0.0	0.363213253189	This is about more than replacing a D with an R. We need a leader who will help us take our government back.
0.0	0.261695016474	I mean, I ask that with all due respect.
0.0	0.102628454324	You're certainly not very good.
0.0	0.390647102776	So I'm asking women, I'm asking men, to support me because I'm ready to go into the White House on January 20th, 2017 and get to work on both domestic and foreign policy challenges.
0.0	0.0869059478512	All right.
0.0	0.527645348762	We can save and preserve and strengthen Social Security by making no changes for seniors, but for younger workers gradually increasing the retirement age, changing the rate of growth so that it matches inflation, and critically allowing younger workers to keep a portion of our tax payments in a personal account that we own, we control them, we can pass on to our kids.
0.0	0.252173581298	The truth is that sentencing for blacks is higher than for whites.
0.0	0.275860081607	And -- and I just want to take this opportunity to say, you know, in the 2012 election, you know, we -- and when I say we, Republicans -- tore themselves apart.
0.0	0.305645066653	They don't believe in building walls and a pessimistic view of the future.
0.0	0.655890543212	No -- no...
0.0	0.292756405551	That is some group of people.
0.0	0.381079474674	... that he tried to take credit for four years later.
0.0	0.11829256152	The Cold War is over.
0.0	0.283934817038	And here's the problem with what's going on around the world.
0.0	0.382694436646	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.434907078332	And we should back up the recent donors conference to make sure we have made our contribution to try to deal with the enormous cost that these refugees are posing to Turkey and to members of the E.U.
0.0	0.232345445067	The answer is that all of the Mexicans, they're criminals and rapists, we've got to hate the Mexicans.
1.0	0.98023931107	ISIL videos, ISIL training videos are telling lone wolves the easiest way to buy a combat assault weapon in America is at a gun show.
0.0	0.316326128927	If we're willing to do what it takes now, the 21st century is going to be the new American century, greater than any other era we've had in the history of this great nation.
0.0	0.0604643147203	But get this.
0.0	0.154304729245	Now, here's what is going to happen.
0.0	0.229276198144	They know it's not a good thing, and they may even be upset by it.
0.0	0.40422374111	Simplifying the code and lowering rates, both for corporations and -- and personal rates, is exactly what we need to do.
0.0	0.169696934157	I think we're at war with jihadists who have --
0.0	0.310122198216	In my world, we'll focus on energy independence and a clean environment.
0.0	0.105436972728	I know how hard that is.
0.0	0.28049498329	I'm not anti-Wall Street, but I don't believe the government ought to wear a team jersey, pick winners and losers.
0.0	0.157149765973	But Bret, here's the problem.
0.0	0.311311032252	So, I want to look at the whole problem and that's why my proposal is much more comprehensive than anything else that's been put forth.
0.0	0.164965917742	I think this is a very difficult issue.
1.0	0.977536585593	It didn't say a word about legalization.
0.0	0.410312983647	What would motivate me and what would be the guiding light for me in terms of immigration reform, Judy, is to bring families together, not divide them up.
0.0	0.0511790031589	No, it should be repealed.
0.0	0.0666064149156	And we have nothing.
0.0	0.380630568689	I have been a strong ally with him on virtually every issue.
0.0	0.355644484085	Now, I'm the only person that's put out a detailed plan on how to deal with entitlements.
0.0	0.291854989389	But today, we're the only nation on the planet that's saddling our kids with a lifetime of bills.
0.0	0.318855381503	But I agree, as I mentioned a moment ago, with King Abdullah.
0.0	0.260208238806	While there are lots of good ideas for reform, we have never tackled the basics.
0.0	0.456955306467	Last week, Secretary Carter announced that the Navy's going to be cut again.
0.0	0.00657879709171	Chris...
0.0	0.339138927635	They're looking -- they're recruiting people that enter this country as doctors and engineers and even fiances.
0.0	0.190537860536	But guess who pushed for that regulation?
0.0	0.261050967745	I will change the culture in Washington, just as I changed the culture in Tallahassee.
0.0	0.155443125585	They don't like NBC, but I like the poll.
0.0	0.476825743249	That is why they're building an -- right now, developing long- range missiles capable of reaching the United States, and that is why there's going -- they're going to use those $100 billion to expand their conventional capabilities and to one day buy or build a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.449293419843	And it is easy to talk the talk about ending Citizens United, but what I think we need to do is show by example that we are prepared to not rely on large corporations and Wall Street for campaign contributions, and that's what I'm doing.
0.0	0.124613502649	We have to find out what's going on.
0.0	0.198183323976	Everybody on this stage is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.269607550907	And when I'm president, we are going to bring it under control once and for all after 30 years of talking about it.
0.0	0.135864741834	It's great to be back.
0.0	0.355056092083	We need a leader who will lead the resurgence of this great nation and unlock its potential once again.
0.0	0.37975141038	Now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world.
0.0	0.377445472106	But I certainly think that the United States should take its full responsibility in helping those people.
0.0	0.394616402964	At the same time, law enforcement understands there are people in the community who not only think that the system doesn't work for them, but works against them.
0.0	0.287686381513	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government in setting up -- retirement plans.
0.0	0.238017148294	I'd like to take a matter of personal privilege here...
0.0	0.12625195604	They have a responsibility, as well.
0.0	0.297315159632	Donald Trump actually seized on it when he talked about immigration.
0.0	0.318063160194	You see, you have one side, the Democrats, and with immigration, all they care about is votes.
0.0	0.0610714221977	... funding to them.
0.0	0.278558395407	Carl, are we really talking about getting government involved in fantasy football?
0.0	0.269905403786	Find out what I said to Greenspan.
0.0	0.276828321636	And we're going to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	0.299125149475	For a start, they're going to start to pay their fair share of taxes.
0.0	0.381073197224	Friends of mine are ordering Kamatsu (ph) tractors now because they've de-valued the yen to such an extent that you can't buy a Caterpillar tractor.
0.0	0.462669814782	Bring the money -- the $2 trillion -- back to the United States.
0.0	0.142448787929	I heard what they said.
0.0	0.247417170411	So, yes, I'd absolutely would go in if he attacked.
0.0	0.360920603386	We need to elect someone who will stand with the American people, who understands its greatness, who understands what an open economy and freedom is all about, but at the same time, has a record of being able to get things done in Washington like we've never seen before.
0.0	0.435525653276	Now, number three -- and let me say this -- when Governor O'Malley was heading the Democratic Governors Association, he had no trouble at all going to Wall Street to raise money to run campaigns for Democratic governors.
0.0	0.223396947222	And we're letting them get away with it and we can't let them get away with it.
0.0	0.391799225104	I believe the world is a safer and a better place when America is the strongest power in the world.
0.0	0.3606801829	... that, having been in the trenches fighting for this, I believe strongly we have to guarantee health care.
0.0	0.200119056409	But it cannot be an American fight.
0.0	0.33757748385	And, you know, take advantage of the tremendous opportunities in energy that God has given us, not get involved in these little petty arguments.
0.0	0.249305633158	... we will secure the border...
0.0	0.161593638944	And I think that ought to be worth something.
0.0	0.100516924553	Ever.
0.0	0.526715625254	And so what I have proposed, number one, is a $5,000 tax credit to help people who have very large out-of-pocket costs be able to afford those.
0.0	0.329502730963	And if you really want to believe that you can get your voice back, I will tell you, as I have all my career, I will continue to fight for you, because you're the ones that built this country, and will carry it into the future.
0.0	0.25011179101	We have people that aren't working.
0.0	0.243554283272	First what they saw in Paris, now what they have seen in San Bernardino.
0.0	0.293725877979	Now, let me just be clear, John.
0.0	0.655890543212	These...
0.0	0.242674306009	... the American middle class, and who are being attacked by ideologues, by demagogues.
0.0	0.406822673438	So I not only had the opportunity to go through the Cold War struggles in Central America, and even after 9/11 to be involved.
0.0	0.384938443623	You cannot destroy ISIS with a military that's being diminished.
0.0	0.0725843908026	You're right.
0.0	0.333973800996	Under each of those three parts of my plan, I have very specific recommendations about what to do.
0.0	0.218359511139	There's not going to be consensus on this issue until we enforce our immigration laws.
0.0	0.16082697233	They're sick of politics as usual.
0.0	0.223036768941	I will stand firm.
1.0	0.991182504595	When that war began, we had 8,000 planes.
0.0	0.131586376412	Well, I've been --
0.0	0.198967262008	So those are some of the areas that I think we've got to move on.
0.0	0.203882361878	We both have a lot of small donors.
0.0	0.315047029255	I was very honored to be asked to do that and very honored to serve with him those first four years.
0.0	0.491313245346	My program would move the 104 programs of the federal Department of Education into four block grants, and send them back to the states because income inequality is driven by a lack of skills when kids don't get what they need to be able to compete and win in this country.
0.0	0.431340677594	Businesses will now have to pay 16 percent on the money they make.
0.0	0.157384562407	So we need to get on a different mindset.
0.0	0.355225013853	Chris, the most important determination any voter is going to make in this election is who's best prepared to be Commander in Chief.
1.0	0.962828878533	And let us be clear that every proposal that I have introduced has been paid for.
0.0	0.312619307505	And, when I hear people talking about means testing, let's just remember what that means.
0.0	0.349077218476	Or, are you going to deal with the problem by saying, I'm going to give people who've done well in this country less benefit on the backend.
0.0	0.213093582939	Makes it a whole lot easier for them to want to go somewhere else.
0.0	0.355796091044	I've spent a lifetime in politics fighting the Clinton machine.
0.0	0.281934879846	We cannot be the world's policeman.
0.0	0.220989515858	How are these people gonna lead us?
0.0	0.34235621355	And we fell into the same trap with Assad, saying -- as if it's our job to say, Assad must go.
0.0	0.232022381018	And I'll tell you, I'm not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump.
0.0	0.283756897288	The fact of the matter is -- and let's say it in our debate, because you'll never hear this from that immigration-bashing carnival barker, Donald Trump, the truth of the matter is...
0.0	0.26262666794	Those are the issues that the American people want discussed.
0.0	0.103898013307	It is a real horror.
0.0	0.368723128362	It means that we end minimum sentencing for those people arrested.
0.0	0.213881621989	But this is nothing new.
0.0	0.26811668907	You have to deal with entitlements, you have to be in a position to control discretionary spending.
0.0	0.418640369287	She actually ran against one of my friends and our head of public safety.
0.0	0.109997721641	I'm proud that I gave him that advice.
0.0	0.0817731694462	That debate reflected a debate between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks.
0.0	0.392017951503	I don't know enough about the technology, Martha, to be able to say what it is, but I have a lot of confidence in our tech experts.
0.0	0.272779308717	What you have now is a very dangerous moment in American history.
0.0	0.237741649833	Well, I don't know if it's a blind trust if Ivanka, Don and Eric run it.
0.0	0.176512857833	That's gonna be the real growth engine.
0.0	0.335484780576	But I look at this country today, and I look at how divided we are, I look at how politicians are always posturing and issuing sound bites but never solving problems.
0.0	0.390638306126	But I do hope that in years to come, just as occurred with Cuba, 10, 20 years ago, people would say, reach normalized relations with Cuba.
0.0	0.158300116556	But let's be clear.
0.0	0.0589458286833	And Mr. Trump is very focused...
0.0	0.0528379066412	Yes -- thank you.
0.0	0.266001132197	And when I'm president, I can tell you this, my faith will not just influence the way I'll govern as president, it will influence the way I live my life.
0.0	0.22167726186	Look, the -- the deal is already done.
0.0	0.394377375612	They know that this country is pushing the middle class, the hardworking taxpayers, backwards, and they saw a president who doesn't understand their pain, and doesn't have any plan for getting away from it.
0.0	0.328541343897	We're going to bring jobs back from Japan, we're going to bring jobs back from China, we're going to bring, frankly, jobs back from Mexico where, as you probably saw, Nabisco is leaving Chicago with one of their biggest plants, and they're moving it to Mexico.
0.0	0.383924261812	We need to be much more far thinking in this new 21st century era of -- of nation state failures and conflict.
1.0	0.424337359074	We are spending hundreds of billions of dollars maintaining 5,000 nuclear weapons.
0.0	0.385210063875	But, by the way, when it comes to a woman having to make a very personal choice, ah, in that case, my Republican colleagues love the government and want the government to make that choice for every woman in America.
0.0	0.29157037521	I was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came.
0.0	0.40456291811	Because we have found a way to reduce hospital costs, so whenever we come...
0.0	0.237704407988	Get it done, because our -- our children and grandchildren are counting on us to get it done.
0.0	0.466735099308	I understand that you're building a nice $2.5 billion car factory in Mexico and that you're going to take your cars and sell them to the United States zero tax, just flow them across the border."
0.0	0.29482335468	That means we have to work more closely with our great tech companies.
0.0	0.417654095447	We need to begin by undoing -- I would begin by undoing a whole set of things that President Obama has done, whether it's illegal amnesty or this latest round of EPA regulations.
0.0	0.280936747707	I know personally how extraordinary and unique this nation is.
0.0	0.404482095299	Well, it's not a matter of what the first executive order would be, Bill.
1.0	0.986551555551	When that war began, we had 529 ships.
0.0	0.173254733484	And that is what's so critical for our neighborhoods, our families, our children, and our grandchildren.
0.0	0.161049646293	Al Qaida was based in Afghanistan.
0.0	0.0775243260378	You can do both.
0.0	0.399104849164	And the final thing I would say, bringing Donald Trump back into it, if you're going to put together a coalition in the region to take on the threat of ISIS you don't want to alienate the very countries and people you need to be part of the coalition.
0.0	0.0498392788989	Look what they did in San Bernardino.
0.0	0.392102076967	I visited with a number of our neighbors in Northern Virginia at a mosque last Friday.
0.0	0.371585025188	Imagine a country where people are lifted out of poverty again.
0.0	0.126228629213	These are very, very real issues.
0.0	0.348792022672	Well, I think it's perfectly fair to say that we invested quite a bit in development aid.
0.0	0.182633557671	... against Islam -- radical Islam -- if you're not for border security.
0.0	0.218998177218	White people?
0.0	0.136417277083	...This is a matter not of math, this is a matter of morality.
0.0	0.0123828822919	...No, sir...
0.0	0.0698156192594	Here's what I believe.
0.0	0.159816219956	And I think has had a big impact.
0.0	0.407813792538	Secondly, I certainly support that we need to tear down cyber walls, not on a mass basis, but on a targeted basis.
1.0	0.964223112976	He voted in favor of regime change with Libya, voted in favor of the Security Council being an active participate in setting the parameters for what we would do, which of course we followed through on.
0.0	0.655890543212	...
0.0	0.0869059478512	She was right.
0.0	0.338542359536	And of course, it has to be de-conflicted with the Russians, who are also flying in that space.
0.0	0.182682628615	Now, you've got Europe.
1.0	0.00811529551363	They stole it.
0.0	0.320235163888	We have ISIS and al Qaeda attacking us.
0.0	0.28147613383	Lawrence Tribe and (inaudible) from Harvard -- of Harvard, said that there is a serious question as to whether or not Ted can do this.
0.0	0.348841934191	And we can take that message and that formula to Washington to lift every single American to a better life.
0.0	0.438906225375	And he did so because taking citizenship off the table was important, and it revealed the hypocrisy of the proponents of this bill, who were looking for votes.
0.0	0.515003198991	I started as a secretary and became ultimately the chief executive of the largest technology company in the world, almost $90 billion in over 150 countries.
0.0	0.374224178597	Reduce our $18 trillion in debt, because, believe me, we're in a bubble.
0.0	0.164514396441	Reforms, everything from moral and cultural issues to economic issues.
0.0	0.236346182334	You know, everyone here talks about the need to take on Washington.
0.0	0.344567442821	Because they're recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees.
0.0	0.178996468246	And I say that to Nikki.
0.0	0.118917776164	I was governor of New York on September 11.
0.0	0.44044693573	So you don't get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.255557560264	I've seen plenty of other people follow up?
1.0	0.506792989343	You know, I left my medical practice and ran for office because I was concerned about an $18 trillion debt.
0.0	0.334033037577	We're going to cut Social Security to help you.
0.0	0.428730698158	I'll tell you this, the number one job of the president of the United States is to protect the safety and security of the American people.
0.0	0.193023249844	What I said was that I think that Dr. Carson's ideas are good ideas.
0.0	0.397225883505	Well, I agree with Rand that I very much respect Ron Paul and that I think anyone who is able to win in the Republican Party has to be able to bring together the disparate elements of the Reagan coalition.
0.0	0.317368636699	I wish we could say yes, let's go destroy ISIS and let's let Assad continue to destroy Syria, which creates more terrorists, more extremists by the minute.
0.0	0.00430451372677	Thank you.
0.0	0.39283004737	Whose fault is it that Medicare is broken, out of money, that Social Security is broken, out of money?
0.0	0.187016693363	There are lids on people's aspirations.
0.0	0.0354616404597	They're protectionist.
1.0	0.969822992854	Third, if you look at my record as governor of New Jersey, I have vetoed a 50-caliber rifle ban.
0.0	0.104290233677	But let's not kid ourselves.
0.0	0.0589788180285	Your prosecute criminals.
1.0	0.933758918717	The blurb said that the next president of the United States has got to be aggressive in bringing people into the political process.
0.0	0.288320499967	Senator Cruz is precisely right.
0.0	0.157330781289	People aren't dumb.
0.0	0.246381105182	We have work to do, and we now know a lot more than we ever did before.
0.0	0.299711583604	But I have never supported cap- and-trade and I never thought it was a good idea.
0.0	0.492510081539	We're asking the top 1.5 percent, including passive income, to start paying a little bit more so that the elderly and disabled vets in this country can live with security and dignity.
0.0	0.106740880139	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.400667314783	Imagine a country where the middle class can get rising income again.
0.0	0.232833557142	We had a decision to make early on, do we do a Super PAC?
0.0	0.280789532805	This president and John Kerry and Hillary Clinton all have made it harder for the next president to act, but he must act to confront the ambitions of Iran.
0.0	0.331558682632	We have not made the investments that we need to make to understand and to have relationships with future leaders that are coming up.
0.0	0.655890543212	But...
0.0	0.14976811386	A military island.
1.0	0.355725580315	It came out recently they have equipment that is 30 years old.
0.0	0.320873256596	We've got a president who cannot bring himself to say the words "radical Islamic terrorism."
0.0	0.333709635806	He said, "there's a chill wind blowing through law enforcement in this country."
0.0	0.215907121836	So now ISIS has the oil, and what they don't have, Iran has.
0.0	0.340091546517	And I'm going to do everything I can to address distressed communities, whether they are communities of color, whether they are white communities, whether they are in any part of our country.
0.0	0.287377923465	And ISIS, make no mistake about it, is an evil in this world.
0.0	0.0961010980615	The worker's out of a job.
0.0	0.347255175329	And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word.
0.0	0.0457649973848	So it is difficult.
0.0	0.435933895186	And the U.S. chamber of commerce, which hardly ever says nice things about Democratic governors anywhere, named our state number one for innovation and entrepreneurship.
0.0	0.286281906325	And, I also just want to thank the audience for being attentive, and noticing the questions, and the noticing the answers.
0.0	0.0559147247023	And the reason -- and the reason...
0.0	0.340243900084	... and I encourage everybody watching this tonight to please, acknowledge that by going online at martinomalley.com and help me wage this campaign for real American capitalism.
0.0	0.0835462512869	I'll check for you.
0.0	0.405128517061	And in our party, unlike the Republican party, we actually believe that the more our people learn, the more they will earn and higher education should be a right for every kid.
0.0	0.118589600781	Because I've done it.
0.0	0.0869059478512	Right.
0.0	0.294167992944	And I will do all that I can in this campaign to reach out and explain what I stand for and what I will do as president.
0.0	0.150864406203	We have a role to play in this world.
0.0	0.18238618126	Now we hear the tough talk.
0.0	0.309694170949	A lot has happened in nine months.
0.0	0.101300245219	We don't win.
0.0	0.282267775082	Otherwise, law enforcement is blind -- blind before, blind during, and, unfortunately, in many instances, blind after.
0.0	0.40284461706	If she gets elected, her first 100 days, instead of setting an agenda, she might be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse.
0.0	0.430284941203	We will rebuild the military to make sure that it is a solid force, not to be the world's policeman, but to make sure that in a peaceful world, people know that the United States is there to take care of our own national interests and take care of our allies.
0.0	0.203039174042	Let em also tell you...
0.0	0.232988834599	Revolution never came.
0.0	0.282601968742	I mean, you have great constitutional lawyers that say you can't run.
0.0	0.130629142575	So there's a lot of balanced interests.
0.0	0.434938525392	When ISIL does training videos that say the easiest way to get a combat assault weapon in the United States of America is at a gun show, then we should all be waking up.
0.0	0.457068813767	Doesn't hurt rich people if their bar of soap goes up ten cents, but it hurts the poor and the middle class.
0.0	0.464432377026	Of course we have to do more to incentivize profit sharing, like we see with Market Basket right here in New Hampshire and New England, where all of the employees get a chance to share in the profits.
0.0	0.298689674957	It's not just about getting rid of a single dictator.
0.0	0.252420574356	Well, Gwen and Judy, thank you very much for hosting this event.
0.0	0.055869258194	You find me...
0.0	0.0626072513631	My plan is there.
0.0	0.349487673342	Yes, I do believe there must be a tax on Wall Street speculation.
0.0	0.314235192976	And what is missing is the political will, because too many Democrats and, sadly, too many Republicans don't want to solve this problem.
0.0	0.286116030402	We need to do it now as a nation.
0.0	0.068023517959	You can't have a question.
0.0	0.186153760345	You've got to keep asking.
0.0	0.0227739551244	For her convenience.
0.0	0.111493745927	Yeah, he said everybody.
0.0	0.655890543212	...
1.0	0.461693503555	In 1988, I lost an election because I said we should not have assault weapons on the streets of America.
0.0	0.369773502346	Well, thank you very much to CBS and everyone here this evening for giving us another chance to appear before you.
0.0	0.336378103788	You did support a U.N. Security Council approach, which we did follow up on.
0.0	0.228381634337	We need a unifier, not a cynical divider in chief, and that's exactly what I will do.
0.0	0.386863513803	Well, Chris, I will apologize to nobody for the vigorousness with which I will fight terrorism, go after ISIS, hunt them down wherever they are, and utterly and completely destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.327813280535	We need to pay attention here in Central America as well.
0.0	0.157484325033	There's been no crowd like this.
0.0	0.0895164163899	This is absolutely absurd.
0.0	0.0405898890393	Where were we attacked?
0.0	0.0649583519173	That's the job.
0.0	0.422920410234	It's a 20 percent flat rate tax, it'll take a blowtorch to the -- to the IRS.
0.0	0.243520274798	We need a president who can solve our problems, bring us together.
0.0	0.134887278905	Renegotiate our foreign trade deals.

0.0	0.257463937816	And then, most importantly, here at home, I think there are three things that we have to get right.
0.0	0.191307400414	And in fact I would go further.
0.0	0.344332203087	That is the fight we have to have, and we have to undo a whole set of things that President Obama has done that get at the heart of his disrespect and disregard for too many Americans.
0.0	0.208682894972	That's not even an issue.
0.0	0.277670058105	We're not -- the American people -- forget about anything else, they've already been lied to and stolen from.
0.0	0.242728702368	I do and this is an important issue and I know we'll get to a lot of other critical ones as well.

0.0	0.0994294060009	I gotta do it, Dad.
0.0	0.190196229234	You know, we had this incident before, Secretary, with your famous e-mails.
0.0	0.203241807143	John, I'd like to address this?
0.0	0.331185193129	I said right from the beginning that we should take no Syrian refugees of any kind.
0.0	0.655890543212	And...
0.0	0.121626568165	It is a false choice.
0.0	0.308260172758	All I'm saying is our next president has to be someone that undoes the damage Barack Obama has done to this country.
0.0	0.339168392018	So actually, the opportunity is there, because of the threat to all of these countries, to bring all of us together...

0.0	0.154652912052	I learned so much.
0.0	0.21423681403	Now, on to your substantive question.

0.0	0.219032656206	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.

0.0	0.0772401729037	That's when we become Greece.

0.0	0.135118002375	QUICK: Governor, thank you.
0.0	0.0986807192597	Secretary Clinton, I do have a disagreement here.
0.0	0.0585367215739	No problem.
0.0	0.0129508168436	That is not what America should be about.
0.0	0.412618411818	One of them is a statewide use of deadly force.
0.0	0.131559117054	It only makes common sense.
0.0	0.409577933642	These are American soldiers and we fail them when we fail to take into account what happens the day after a dictator falls and when we fail to act with a whole of government approach with sustainable development, diplomacy, and our economic power in alignment with our principles.
0.0	0.185032393991	It's a disaster, and we have to protect Israel.
0.0	0.263935628753	When I was in Washington, I fought to get the budget balanced.
0.0	0.366632642608	So, what we want to do is to say, look, we have 11 million people who have been here, many of them for decades.
0.0	0.354927223235	She wants to continue down the path of Iran, Benghazi, the Russian reset, Dodd-Frank, all the things that have -- that have gone wrong in this country, she would be a national security mess.

0.0	0.208429666938	I don't think the term is what's important.
0.0	0.269896722209	Our staffer at that point did exactly the right thing.
0.0	0.363820532726	And the same goes for overseas, where we have to put together a coalition of Muslim nations.
0.0	0.169406299015	But what -- I will tell you this.
0.0	0.427723796129	People are being released from jail without the education, without the job training, without the resources that they need to get their lives together, then they end up -- we're shocked that they end up back in jail again.
0.0	0.387597466596	We have got to demilitarize local police departments so they do not look like occupying armies.
0.0	0.379887092355	As a matter of fact, if you're Hispanic or African-American in Texas, you have the number one high school graduation rates in America.
0.0	0.0546606228292	That's my bill.
0.0	0.48143827991	But I'd sign a second one, as I did in New York, as well, having a hard hiring freeze on adding new employees except for the military or defense-related positions.
0.0	0.214948812674	Sometimes it's a complicated situation, but some things are black and white.
0.0	0.390057841967	I've tried to be as specific to answer questions so that my proposals can be vetted, because I feel like we have to level with people for the very reason, Gwen, that you are mentioning.
0.0	0.331579813017	This nation has been great to me, and that's the only way I know to pay you back.
0.0	0.257664917423	They beat us all the time.
0.0	0.195167776022	And, for those of us who are serious enough to run for president, think long and hard why we're here, and hopefully you'll know we're not here for ourselves.
0.0	0.373912233407	And that is important, because now we have a U.N. Security Council that will enable us to do that.
0.0	0.286533629066	Reported it in the Wall Street Journal recently.
0.0	0.154044453973	They blow people up.

0.0	0.252686719344	We're going to cut costs.
0.0	0.240677037311	We did as much as we could because the Libyans themselves had very strong feelings about what they wished to accept.
0.0	0.354504936599	I know everyone else on this stage hopes to earn your support.
0.0	0.279282221404	We get Bergdahl, they get five killer terrorists that everybody wanted over there.
0.0	0.320255646204	We put in place child care support.
0.0	0.246300485356	Make our police officers proud of what they do but more important than that, let them know how proud we are of them."
0.0	0.0869059478512	That is not right.
0.0	0.33451344579	And he allows states to go ahead and do whatever they want on a substance that's illegal.
0.0	0.573954952699	Free college, a single payer system for health, and it's been estimated were looking at 18 to $20 trillion, about a 40 percent in the federal budget.
0.0	0.243184424699	Let me -- let me answer your question on the Sun-Sentinel editorial today.
0.0	0.0226720661381	Yeah.
0.0	0.148089962128	That is abundantly clear.
0.0	0.151750924841	That's the future of banking in America.
0.0	0.468386977517	The entire system of legal immigration must now be reexamined for security first and foremost, with an eye on ISIS.
0.0	0.0869059478512	All right.
0.0	0.393018313096	We have more people in jail today than any other country on earth.
0.0	0.0146586620172	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.387306694975	It's one of the key investments we need to make.
0.0	0.489933171708	To tell Qatar, that instead of spending $200 billion on the World Cup, maybe they should pay attention to ISIS, which is at their doorstep.
0.0	0.10536701284	He wasn't a cheerleader; he was the opposite.
0.0	0.355302946302	Well, first of all the -- the plan gives people the option of -- of opting out.
0.0	0.217049536265	But, I don't believe that Washington should be picking winners and losers.
0.0	0.273195282161	Now, secondly, let me say I'm a maniac and everyone on this stage is stupid, fat, and ugly.
0.0	0.152334857817	I'll tell you how optimistic I am about America.
0.0	0.346427733515	I believe this is still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.417644841395	They make a billion dollars a day.
0.0	0.275076289094	And I was clear about that at the time.
0.0	0.364969428068	Your proposal is to go and send the health care system to the state.
0.0	0.452128361355	As a member of the Health Education Committee that helped write the Affordable Care Act, much of what Secretary Clinton said about what we have done, among other things, ending the obscenity of this pre-existing situation is a step forward.
0.0	0.246129983692	That is total propaganda, and this is what happens in our society.
0.0	0.312195232392	Right and left are spending us into oblivion.
0.0	0.355834157253	A friend of mine who's a great manufacturer, calls me up a few weeks ago.
0.0	0.208980248974	And as a result of that, the shah of Iran came in, terrible dictator.
0.0	0.358887198304	There's probably no person I respect more in the country or in recent history than my father.
0.0	0.0704347845628	Sure did.
0.0	0.220820128561	Crony capitalism is alive and well, and has been so in Washington, D.C. for decades.
0.0	0.166737517267	Hillary Clinton lies about Benghazi, she lies about e- mails.
0.0	0.319217157049	So I think that we need to build on the work of the policing commissioner that President Obama impaneled.
0.0	0.342210453433	And let me just say a word about coalition-building, because I've heard Senator Sanders say this.
0.0	0.246480226171	Well, our prayers are with the people of France tonight, but that is not enough.
0.0	0.0527568255203	I understand.
0.0	0.168817797801	And I will tell you something that really galls me.
0.0	0.322503404909	And finally, on health care, why don't we start treating -- keep giving...
0.0	0.233498034873	Because we have no protection and we have no competence, we don't know what's happening.
0.0	0.488674867063	Suicide, alcoholism, drugs, that's why we need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country, and not just a handful of billionaires who have enormous economic and political power.
0.0	0.171612081228	They're killing us.
1.0	0.392607251208	And our real unemployment is anywhere from 18 to 20 percent.
0.0	0.362501619994	I am not a single- issue candidate, and I do not believe we live in a single-issue country.
0.0	0.302391618863	We are looking at an economy in which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.
0.0	0.0397485016591	That's fine.
0.0	0.118791439353	We saw that in Egypt.
0.0	0.307771622418	You get, like, three days where you have to show up?
0.0	0.100906356815	Somebody said -- thank you, darlin'.
0.0	0.327577245022	No, it is not throwing -- it is an extraordinary investment for this country.
0.0	0.40850474019	I think Americans want someone to have a track record of showing them how to get this country back on record, someone who will stand up and every day project that best days of America are in front of us.
0.0	0.294665439878	The president's first impulse is do this by executive order, power he doesn't have.
0.0	0.355444949248	We're bringing corporate taxes down, bringing money back in, corporate inversions.
0.0	0.188475163246	I don't -- look, I don't think anybody should be expanding Medicaid.
0.0	0.220605310218	And Secretary Clinton, unfortunately, is on the wrong side.
0.0	0.348279719337	And I will go back and say again, AIG was not a big bank.
0.0	0.0151896662855	What would we do if this were ebola?
0.0	0.31821084693	We need to have a resolve that will bring the world together to root out the kind of radical jihadist ideology that motivates organizations like ISIS, a barbaric, ruthless, violent jihadist terrorist group.
0.0	0.413302230032	So what I would say is not only do we need to be thinking in military terms, but we do our military a disservice when we don't greatly dial up the investment that we are making in diplomacy and human intelligence and when we fail to dial up properly, the role of sustainable development in all of this.
0.0	0.0576739777427	He can't have it both ways.
0.0	0.0187705142847	I won't be doing that.
0.0	0.329231405832	In 2011, the sequester was passed as a reform to slow down the rate of government.
0.0	0.313841940271	But the United States is not the policeman of the world.
0.0	0.147522129546	They do not get any credit for their care-taking responsibilities.
0.0	0.296664261934	We can't afford another four years of that.
0.0	0.288199682646	We can have debt-free college in the United States.
0.0	0.386580758289	A no-fly zone would prevent the outflow of refugees and give us a chance to have some safe spaces.
0.0	0.385030234296	And the people who are getting hammered are small businesses, it's single moms, it's Hispanics.
0.0	0.462601673918	Well, let's just -- let's just follow up on this, because, you know, I've made it very clear that no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail, and because of Dodd-Frank, we now have in law a process that the president, the Federal Reserve, and others can use if any bank poses a systemic risk.
0.0	0.299015549884	Well, let me be clear about one thing, there's only one savior and it's not me.
0.0	0.181777087496	That's his first responsibility.
0.0	0.334282800472	That's the side we need to be on, and that's the side of the bulk of the -- of the Middle East.
0.0	0.408547118527	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.372582513909	And why I am a staunch supporter of President Obama's principal accomplishment -- namely the Affordable Care Act -- is because I know how hard it was to get that done.
0.0	0.368211974448	We need to have some coalitions in that part of the world to go after ISIS, but we also need to send a clear message.
0.0	0.127662996496	It's called the politics.
0.0	0.294291624248	I believe in government, but I believe in efficient government, not wasteful government.
0.0	0.0985479471541	Yes, I'm getting...
0.0	0.302660383178	Secondly, I don't believe in free tuition for everybody.
0.0	0.655890543212	...
1.0	0.978281849799	Senator Sanders voted against the Brady Bill.
0.0	0.341199230945	My point is this: I won two landslide elections, I made big changes.
0.0	0.0165577652614	We can't do it.
0.0	0.233951217046	This ties into campaign finance reform.
0.0	0.188372665827	First of all...
0.0	0.258387821058	I know every one.
0.0	0.157330781289	The people aren't dumb.
0.0	0.0553329501659	But he wasn't a cheerleader.
0.0	0.205607689981	Let me put those proposals-- and you're absolutely right.
0.0	0.0508911114757	(inaudible).
0.0	0.369296266993	This president has gone to Congress and said give me a three-year deadline, give me a ban on ground troops.
0.0	0.322498912714	I would also just say this.
0.0	0.406331861998	The reality is four times as many blacks get arrested for marijuana.
0.0	0.202822498465	Because we need money.
0.0	0.434953937001	And we would still have governors like Scott Walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions.
0.0	0.229796438054	I want to ask you: Are you fed up with how Washington taxes you?
0.0	0.413021901262	So as a nation we need to increase what we invest in Pell grants.
0.0	0.0395391627093	That is the issue.
0.0	0.333894560696	... First of all -- Let me go first, and then you can please recognize Rand after.
0.0	0.199972482392	They've become rich.
0.0	0.342933357598	They should be running all the time, then they won't have time to plan attacks against us.
0.0	0.32260910102	I am the only person in either campaign that's self-funding.
0.0	0.316238622683	We have got to destroy their training camps over there before they can attack us here.
0.0	0.481425213536	We last year there was an additional 81,000 pages of government regulations.
0.0	0.416021729781	This is a new era of conflict where traditional ways of huge standing armies are not as -- serve our purposes as well as special ops, better intelligence and being more proactive.
0.0	0.0580236053725	I really am.
0.0	0.337024451896	The first impulse of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton is to take rights away from law- abiding citizens.
0.0	0.655890543212	...
0.0	0.5	Every progressive economist who has analyzed that says that the numbers don't add up, and that's a promise that cannot be kept, and it's really important now that we are getting into the rest of the country that both of us are held to account for explaining what we are proposing because, especially with healthcare, this is not about math.
0.0	0.0918526055885	I don't know where you...
0.0	0.467753555699	The United States was asked to support the Europeans and the Arab partners that we had and we did a lot of due diligence about whether we should or not, and eventually, yes, I recommended and the president decided that we would support the action to protect civilians on the ground and that led to the overthrow of Gadhafi.
0.0	0.215958641872	They're devaluing their currency and they're killing our companies.

0.0	0.269871373957	The truth is this, the big problem, we need a leader in Washington who understands how to get something done, not to talk about it, not to propose it, to get it done.
0.0	0.174966375559	And, I'm going to tell you exactly how we're going to deal with it when I am president.
0.0	0.281753921792	I will find the guy that's going to take that military and make it really work.

0.0	0.19568614559	But all of these politicians that I'm running against now, they're trying to disassociate.

0.0	0.292032386825	It always seems to be the private marketplace does a better job.

0.0	0.282042136631	If Teddy Roosevelt, a good Republican, were alive today, you know what he'd say?

0.0	0.331842370848	The time to turn the page is now.
0.0	0.281123564969	And most heads of businesses -- large, medium and small -- understand that.
0.0	0.470851886866	And I would note the Senate just a few weeks ago voted to suspend refugees from Middle Eastern countries.
0.0	0.330268266334	But the problem with free trade is you need really talented people to negotiate for you.
0.0	0.214793043155	One thing I want to be clear about tonight.
0.0	0.0083283021374	Ford.
1.0	0.389542091076	We can't afford to have another four years like the last eight years.

0.0	0.143261739218	This is a bad deal.
0.0	0.432123597361	One thing I like to remind people is, back in 2007, Rudy Giuliani was leading the polls for almost a year.
0.0	0.335854396556	We're going to lose Social Security and Medicare if Republicans and Democrats do not come together and find a solution like Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.510919356435	I believe that we pay for many of the things that we need to do again as a nation, investing in the skills of our people, our infrastructure, and research and development and also climate change by the elimination of one big entitlement that we can no longer afford as a people, and that is the entitlement that many of our super wealthiest citizens feel they are entitled to pay -- namely, a much lower income tax rate and a lower tax rate on capital gains.
0.0	0.148550573637	I believe it is a right.
0.0	0.0109382915112	They didn't do that.
0.0	0.299389487955	And when we -- and when we do that, we don't do what the Republicans want, which is to cut Social Security.
0.0	0.435216781519	John, there is not a serious economist who would disagree that the six big banks of Wall Street have taken on so much power and that all of us are still on the hook to bail them out on their bad bets.
0.0	0.134436806804	We can do a wall.
0.0	0.308728480887	That sounds like people are afraid the president's going to take their guns away.
0.0	0.158074192451	If this all works out, I'm happy to consider naming you as V.P.
0.0	0.383744335748	I don't think any -- I don't think any sensible person would disagree that the invasion of Iraq led to the massive level of instability we are seeing right now.
0.0	0.213073033289	I can agree with you or not, but you can't have a question over your head.
0.0	0.276147735996	We need to have stronger families.
0.0	0.285433746036	I am a conservative; I can win this job, I can do this job, I need your help, I need your support.
0.0	0.5	It is imposed on business and a critical piece that Marco seems to be missing is that this 16 percent business flat tax enables us to eliminate the corporate income tax.
0.0	0.315022185004	But you've just asked a very fundamental question about the role of faith in our country.
0.0	0.256737634604	I believe that our Constitution protects everybody, regardless of their sexual orientation or any other aspect.
0.0	0.429378147716	Well, I think, Judy, what has to be appreciated is that, as a result of the disastrous and illegal behavior on Wall Street, millions of lives were hurt.
0.0	0.341365928927	I am convinced that this president, if he could get rid of the Second Amendment, he would.
0.0	0.252035754754	And there's a reason why Hillary's supporters are echoing Donald's attacks on me, because Hillary...
0.0	0.273710570685	I think, you know, Rand and I have some significant issues on policy, but I respect Rand.
0.0	0.353963675671	But all of this has to come together when we have a positive attitude, an optimistic approach, an ability for us to set the tune as conservatives, to invite other people in to be part of that orchestra.
0.0	0.272285647443	We don't have to have refugees come to our country, but all Muslims, seriously?
0.0	0.402957906285	I've laid out a very aggressive plan to reign in Wall Street -- not just the big banks.
0.0	0.305258476286	So we've got some real work to do, and let's try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the Russians.
0.0	0.101671114962	There was nothing to this birther issue.
0.0	0.244296734809	And the fact is this is what makes a difference when you're a governor.
0.0	0.360222990648	And I am the one true fiscal conservative who will look at all spending.
0.0	0.417367572605	My four children have been able to receive a good Christian education, and I've been able to save for them to go to college so they never have to have the loans that I did.
0.0	0.0886532977814	You get the Congress.
0.0	0.382609444319	Because that person should not have gotten a gun, should not -- would not have passed a background check.
0.0	0.271810188103	I think it would be a grave mistake to ask for any more Iranian troops inside Syria.
0.0	0.304994571552	I'm one of the 77 percent.
0.0	0.306956918827	My plan would sweep all of them into a regulatory framework so we can try to get ahead of what the next problems might be.
0.0	0.150864406203	We have a role to play in this world.
0.0	0.0850114441971	I don't have to, believe it or not.
0.0	0.309219708283	They ain't going to like me and Wall Street is going to like me even less.
0.0	0.360418038142	But as president, I will spend even more time thinking about the futures of all the kids and the grandchildren in this country because I want to make sure every single child has a chance to live up to his or her God-given potential.
0.0	0.5	Republican leadership joined with every single Democrat, add $80 trillion to our debt to do nothing to fix the problems.
0.0	0.251824240841	It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are.
0.0	0.655890543212	This is 2016.

0.0	0.0846337530676	Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, they're no better.
0.0	0.288382831559	Our friends no longer think we have their back and our enemies no longer fear us, and we're in a much difficult -- we're in a much different position than we should be.
0.0	0.29250429608	The DNC has hired vendors.
1.0	0.969248175936	Who denies that real unemployment today, including those who have given up looking for work and are working part-time is close to 10 percent?

0.0	0.290676712829	He thinks low wages are a good idea.
0.0	0.517908826133	He used chemical weapons, he's killed, now, over a quarter of a million of his own people, and this president has done nothing.
0.0	0.389329363231	But what we're seeing happening in Libya right now is that there has been a fragile agreement to put aside the differences that exist among Libyans themselves to try to dislodge ISIS from Sirte, the home town of Gadhafi, and to begin to try to create a national government.
0.0	0.280459093766	But Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term, and you should be showing up to work.
0.0	0.114609013351	Bottom line.
0.0	0.235908099518	So I said, "That's OK." I'm proud of my net worth.

0.0	0.0109382915112	Don't do it."
0.0	0.353889825364	I'll tell them that we're going to grow the economy so that we can give people better opportunities so they don't have to rely exclusively on benefit types of programs.
0.0	0.374244976863	They would like to rip it up and start all over again, throw our nation back into this really contentious debate that we've had about health care for quite some time now.

0.0	0.185789466054	Fact check me.
0.0	0.445437955673	I cut the bureaucracy down to size, re-introduced accountability, focused on service, on innovation, on leading in every market, in every product segment.

0.0	0.132914544395	I think we need to be very careful with tariffs, and here's why.
0.0	0.139857185416	The fact is, the reason why...

0.0	0.0605787807165	He's wrong.
0.0	0.107928885091	It should be what are your substantive positions...
0.0	0.307769789725	All over this country we have Republican candidates for president saying we hate the government.
0.0	0.373843916164	We also reduced incarceration rates to 20-year lows.
0.0	0.17294242692	You can -- if you -- you flew in with your 767, didn't you?
0.0	0.480344445977	Our Medicare for all single-payer proposal will save the average middle class family $5,000 a year.
0.0	0.255187786535	So I just truly, with all my heart belief, I like everybody on the stage.
0.0	0.333328664415	And recognizing that it's so important, this election, because we're talking about America for the people versus America for the government.
0.0	0.228838394238	Well, Chris, I'm glad to discuss my views on ethanol and energy.
0.0	0.144735623054	They were paid speeches.
0.0	0.214205398406	I didn't know I had so much power.
0.0	0.131572914699	We ended up with 56 votes.
0.0	0.066908202446	That's how you go from secretary to CEO.
0.0	0.223436201095	We got the kids involved in a whole lot of issues.
0.0	0.29927759979	The questions that are being asked shouldn't be trying to get people to tear into each other.
0.0	0.0937322607697	And before I say it, I have to say this.
0.0	0.247652868568	And I have set forth a compact that would do just that for debt-free tuition.
0.0	0.404664599289	So many companies are going to leave our country.
0.0	0.443810770015	The Kurds have been asking us to arm them for three years.
0.0	0.377316118998	And that is that we have some colleges and universities that are spending a huge amount of money on fancy dormitories and on giant football stadiums.
0.0	0.41407616507	That is why I'm going to have a tax on Wall Street speculation to make certain that public colleges and universities in America are tuition free.
0.0	0.0889968289399	Am I supposed to dislike them?
0.0	0.310197776507	don't listen to the Trumps of the world and allowing them to divide us.
0.0	0.21221558368	I never said that.
0.0	0.331752315239	If we're gonna reform welfare for poor people, we ought to reform it for rich people, as well.
0.0	0.340848306088	There's too much -- it's like -- it's like take the New England Patriots and Tom Brady and have them play your high school football team.
0.0	0.334629729508	We even had warnings about the Boston Marathon bombers, and yet the dots weren't connected.
0.0	0.449032882891	We have $2.5 trillion outside of the United States which we want to bring back in.
0.0	0.339769881268	And let me tell you, ISIS and terrorists do not get their guns from a gun show.
1.0	0.336988673282	We don't need the federal government to be involved in this at all.
0.0	0.0367473336696	No, Martha, I would not.
0.0	0.337801032557	And we don't need a weak person being president of the United State, OK?
0.0	0.280802191725	And that is that one of the things you're watching tonight are 11 quality candidates debating an important issue.
0.0	0.315558375904	None of these instances that the president points to as the reason why he's doing these things would have been preventive.
0.0	0.41763525106	Everybody's record's going to be scrutinized, and at the end of the day we need to unite behind the winner so we can defeat Hillary Clinton, because she is a disaster.
0.0	0.419965272187	But I look forward to signing that bill into law as president and auditing the Fed and providing needed accountability at the Federal Reserve.
0.0	0.161922781111	I saw them come down.
0.0	0.364661007909	... we have the tools in federal law to do this now.
0.0	0.339169018515	It's a huge public health challenge.
0.0	0.280942362938	Let me give you one quick example.
0.0	0.228926485721	Martha -- I would just repeat that --
0.0	0.399333311514	I far prefer that and the chances we have to be successful there than trying to start all over again, gridlocking our system, and trying to get from zero to 100 percent.
0.0	0.277409771182	Got to go to Haiti last year.
0.0	0.271332784889	And so -- and I've always made that clear about that cover story.
0.0	0.352668245938	And this is beanbag compared to what the Clinton hit machine is going to do to the Republican nominee.
0.0	0.117637172395	We have to stop, and it has to stop now.
0.0	0.272789825039	Because criminals don't buy their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.138273878993	I don't think we're at war with Islam.
0.0	0.342551086825	I'm very clear that we have a distinct difference between those of us on this stage tonight and all of our Republican counterparts.
0.0	0.279697185263	I was responsible for the convention center on the west side.
0.0	0.655890543212	...
0.0	0.417316966462	But out-of-pocket costs have gone up too much and prescription drug costs have gone through the roof.
0.0	0.270481159296	Can I just add one very quick thing?
0.0	0.408700204918	And let me be clear: While there are some great corporations creating jobs and trying to do the right thing, in my view -- and I say this very seriously -- the greed of the billionaire class, the greed of Wall Street is destroying this economy and is destroying the lives of millions of Americans.
1.0	0.982415979637	We lose 33,000 people a year already to gun violence, arming more people to do what I think is not the appropriate response to terrorism.
0.0	0.385662930445	And now in Ohio, with the same formula, wages higher than the -- than the national average.
0.0	0.111014974525	Go on to my website.
0.0	0.214715974843	And so that is part of the reason why this is so difficult.
0.0	0.25475727512	But he used to say, "Donald, don't go into Manhattan.
0.0	0.514177894641	I have a concrete plan to do just that, which allows people to keep HSAs to encourage savings, it allows for people that are retiring with Social Security to be able to get a minimum of 125 percent of the poverty level so that there is a baseline that in this generous country of ours no one goes below.
0.0	0.348982134579	If I'm the nominee, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.0533506332284	Divisive and with no vision.
0.0	0.0573193935051	They're not so stupid.
0.0	0.144291757584	That's the secondary issue.
0.0	0.424864130408	At that particular point in time, then Americans will believe that Washington is up to a conversation to deal with the millions of people that are here illegally, but not until.
0.0	0.331423567693	That's get rid of Planned Parenthood funding from the United States of America.
0.0	0.140515718925	There are thing that can be done.
0.0	0.449606999644	And you combine that with a plan to make manufacturing -- this country number one in manufacturing, you've got someone who's going to help revitalize and give hope to America, the place -- the place is that is the most hopeless today.
0.0	0.085920970374	Yes.
0.0	0.269878314963	Because a lot of people said, "He'll never run.
0.0	0.409189672627	And if you want to know who's telling the truth, you should look and ask people like Jeff Sessions and Steve King and Rush Limbaugh and Mark Levin, all of whom say, as Jeff Sessions said, responding to these false attacks just recently in Alabama -- he said, "if it wasn't for Ted Cruz, the Gang of Eight Rubio/Schumer bill would have passed.
0.0	0.0926193607589	And the fact is that that's not a democracy.
0.0	0.317927612742	And as president, I will rebuild the military and keep this country safe.
0.0	0.313568455156	These mythical Arab armies that my friends talk about that are going to protect us don't exist.
0.0	0.39252569708	I would sign an executive order protecting religious liberty, our first amendment rights, so Christian business owners and individuals don't face discrimination for having a traditional view of marriage.
0.0	0.149087601034	They don't want them made here.
0.0	0.237342509192	You know, Chris, here's what happened with Medicaid in my state.
0.0	0.288917220635	And we have people that are controlled by special interests.
0.0	0.366654135499	Senator Sanders voted against it at that time.
0.0	0.293646085661	So I said (ph), "No, that's the wrong number.
0.0	0.357468423128	And we need to bring our debt under control, make our economy stronger.
0.0	0.238845347957	And I used it to pay off my loans.
0.0	0.388785042245	But let's be clear: Russia's aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO -- correctly, I believe -- are saying, you know what, we're going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action.
0.0	0.13341656789	You know, they want to be a little cool.
0.0	0.104795724758	I got the briefings.
0.0	0.157340825167	We have made some good progress.
0.0	0.12667338632	And you know, he's right.
1.0	0.537208164517	And yes, we did ask everyone -- the top 14 percent of earners in our state to pay more in their income tax and we were the only state to go four years in a row without a penny's increase to college tuitions.
0.0	0.309795121117	And this president, given what Ted said right at the beginning, he's absolutely right.
0.0	0.0508911114757	Then (inaudible)...
0.0	0.466456930229	I also think the war on drugs has disproportionately affected our African-American community, and what we need to do is make sure that the war on drugs is equal protection under the law and that we don't unfairly incarcerate another generation of young African-American males.
0.0	0.307825590307	But now as I travel the country, people say what I feel.
0.0	0.26756737899	This is a group of people that enslaves women and sells them, sells them as brides.
0.0	0.0094513199704	This is the fantasy...
0.0	0.255970262073	And our economy was growing like crazy.
0.0	0.554448527838	Now, Secretary Clinton's Super PAC, as I understand it, received $25 million dollars last reporting period, $15 million dollars from Wall Street.
0.0	0.170427214147	We disagreed on the war in Iraq.
0.0	0.251757557264	But I don't want us to be painting with too broad a brush.
0.0	0.124299202425	They are not our friend, believe me.
0.0	0.252634524522	A few days ago a similar incident happened.
0.0	0.287781674619	Now, I can tell you there are a lot of private-sector things that you could do with $12,500, which will get you a lot more than you get from this government program.
0.0	0.347544725341	Well, listen, I've spent my entire life defending the Constitution before the U.S. Supreme Court.
0.0	0.443512090325	Unfortunately, Governor Christie has endorsed many of the ideas that Barack Obama supports, whether it is Common Core or gun control or the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor or the donation he made to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.230775345674	Since I was attacked too.
0.0	0.245331877944	Here's my second problem.
0.0	0.200742878179	Don't vote for me if you want to keep the gridlock in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.0561779913334	You're welcome.
0.0	0.194381953722	I have fully endorsed those.
0.0	0.36154353307	Well, there's no question that ISIS is a very serious problem, and I don't believe that this administration recognizes how serious it is.
0.0	0.483732452484	And it was even reported incorrectly yesterday, because they said, "He had assets of $9 billion."
0.0	0.393635273056	Maybe it's because I hadn't given money to the foundation or donated to his wife's Senate campaign.
0.0	0.40180721908	These folks, CNBC, they had it down at three, three and a half hours.
0.0	0.260294545227	He needs to recognize that those kinds of things are in fact an existential threat to us.
0.0	0.436238516409	Well, I think -- I think that is very unfair to a few you mentioned, most particularly Jordan, which has put a lot on the line for the United States, has also taken in hundreds of thousands of refugees from Syria, and has been, therefore, subjected to threats and attacks by extremists themselves.
0.0	0.286094388125	I do not think we should promise or even look toward normalizing relations because we have a lot of other business to get done with Iran.
0.0	0.228190737194	And at that point, it's a life that we have the right to protect, and I think we should protect.
0.0	0.33677379311	I would like to take a hard look at every part of the federal government and really do the kind of analysis that would rebuild some confidence in people that we're taking a hard look about what we have, you know, and what we don't need anymore.
0.0	0.309230217715	And you better get rid of them because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.162464549456	Kevin, if I could just jump in.
0.0	0.320425490821	Let's don't use the term 'boots on the ground'.
0.0	0.173204787932	Now, Donald...
1.0	0.34140587241	He is the foremost expert in our country on the minimum wage, and what its effects are.
0.0	0.5	They are the best funded radical jihadist group in the history of the world, and they have shown a sophisticated understanding of the laws of other countries on how to insert fighters into places, and they are actively plotting to attack us here at home and around the world.
0.0	0.0955108343887	Media notwithstanding.
0.0	0.194354960053	I want to reverse that decline.
0.0	0.396290957078	The government is not supposed to be in every part of our lives, and that is what is causing the problem.
0.0	0.0691732293983	Japan, the same thing.
0.0	0.470598485049	You know that the United States per capita pays far and away more than other country.
0.0	0.319825023938	I voted against the war in Iraq because I listened very carefully to what President Bush and Vice President Cheney had to say and I didn't believe them.
0.0	0.320852919796	One principle, for example, we've got to embrace is on immigration.
0.0	0.407084283726	We had all kinds of questions that we discussed and, you know, at the end, I recommended to the president that we take the chance to do what we could to find out whether that was bin Laden and to finally bring him to justice.
0.0	0.27779204972	I have a proven record as governor of the state of Florida, as a conservative leader.
1.0	0.382446529892	And we'll save a trillion dollars over the next 10 years.
0.0	0.363510510811	It brought booming economic growth and that growth fueled rebuilding the military.
0.0	0.271341571933	But then they're going to get a call from the donors or probably from the lobbyist for Ford and say, "You can't do that to Ford, because Ford takes care of me and I take care of you, and you can't do that to Ford."
0.0	0.463409051262	The Children's Health Insurance Program, which I helped to create, which covers 8 million kids, is also a different kind of program.
0.0	0.0599640396104	Think of it.
0.0	0.208040443734	It will be fly-to country.
0.0	0.353538251767	The fact is, there's a number of things that the next president is going to have to do to clean up this mess.
0.0	0.418504125762	The great failing of these last 10 or 15 years, John, has been our failing of human intelligence on the ground.
0.0	0.263980105079	As we speak, there are new problems on the horizon.
0.0	0.390157077288	Government trying to level the playing field between Internet and brick-and-mortar creates a problem.
0.0	0.470365729107	A flat tax for everybody -- no exemptions, no deductions, no shelters, because some people have a better capability of taking advantage of those than others.
0.0	0.373740080882	But all of my career, you know, having been raised in -- by a mailman father whose father was a coal miner, who died of black lung and was losing his eyesight; or a mother whose mother could barely speak English.
0.0	0.156682414172	What we have to do is end over-policing in African- American neighborhoods.
0.0	0.3134488184	We elected a president that is weakening America on the global stage.
0.0	0.116288452065	You have all of these disastrous airports.
0.0	0.127563460609	He couldn't answer the question.
0.0	0.375797374341	But let me have one area of disagreement with the Secretary.
0.0	0.121091876367	It's affordable for everybody.
0.0	0.175048736231	You can't do it with empty promised.
1.0	0.967117015244	Secretary Clinton changes her position on this every election year, it seems, having one position in 2000 and then campaigning against President Obama and saying we don't need federal standards.
0.0	0.287025120118	I still want to get back to health care, because I think that's a worthy topic to explore.
1.0	0.963623335669	Look at the attack they inspired in Philadelphia, that the White House still refuses to link to terror, where a guy basically shot a police officer three times.
0.0	0.149328470559	Growth is the answer.
0.0	0.401794083731	... and to devote the resources from the booming economy to rebuilding our Navy, rebuilding our Air Force, rebuilding our Army and ensuring we have the capacity to keep this country safe.
0.0	0.211400087949	They want to say they're getting some of the liberty vote.
0.0	0.367249050443	The business flat tax, they already impose their taxes on us, so there's no reciprocal...
0.0	0.277906364318	Bernie Sanders has already said it.
0.0	0.191014240132	And that's what we should focus on is the violence in our communities.
0.0	0.240972479995	We are at 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.0741588697799	So we need 1,000.
0.0	0.192070279374	So you know what needs to happen, it's a very simple equation, and it's going to happen when I'm president.
0.0	0.274115188013	It is time for Republicans in D.C. to fight.
0.0	0.339593095909	That's the way to get women's wages up, and that's good for them and good for their families and good for our communities.
0.0	0.200817842214	You can't grow your way out of demographics.
0.0	0.378908278644	If we had guns in California on the other side where the bullets went in the different direction, you wouldn't have 14 or 15 people dead right now.
0.0	0.204497118493	Well, I think it's pretty clear that they know that I will.
0.0	0.199879538855	Well, the deal was done.
0.0	0.334254240939	But I would probably have my children run it with my executives and I wouldn't ever be involved because I wouldn't care about anything but our country, anything.
0.0	0.298779881758	And that someone in that office has to do their job.
0.0	0.424117801294	... in addition to that, we go ahead and we take the oil from them, their source of revenue.
0.0	0.308439451868	Somebody who is very fond of the president, agrees with him most of the time, I disagree with his recent deportation policies.
0.0	0.137887022388	We need to stop that.
0.0	0.0779068480443	And it isn't because I'm all that great.
0.0	0.0730571705566	And we're gonna be there very soon.
0.0	0.144862444255	And here's what the economic issue is.
0.0	0.122955551825	I've been there 35 times.
0.0	0.399462045249	Let me concur with the secretary, no question women's rights are under fierce attack all over this country.
0.0	0.13245147615	It never happens.
0.0	0.276763731673	I think what's interesting about where that liberty vote goes that my father brought to the Republican Party is, I don't think they're necessarily going to go for Ted.
0.0	0.257546055482	Clearly, we have to have a very specific set of actions to take.
0.0	0.436925657467	$19 billion of tax cuts, 1.3 million jobs created.
1.0	0.940117898623	I think it's great standing up here with the senator and the governor talking about these issues, because you're not going to hear anything like this from any of the Republicans who are running for president.
0.0	0.655890543212	It was the AFL-CIO.
0.0	0.36010712703	The insurance companies, the drug companies are bribing the United States Congress.
0.0	0.0561293110059	They're a scam.
0.0	0.362019400134	Wait a minute, he has basically used his answer to impune my integrity.
0.0	0.35371971517	I'm in favor of people coming into this country legally.
0.0	0.394361696661	They will never again support it, and that's wrong for our country, bad for our future.
0.0	0.265120570003	And if I misrepresented those results or those projections in any way, I was held criminally liable.
0.0	0.216304596956	And I want to make this our government.
0.0	0.427063350032	I have fought my entire life to make sure that healthcare is a right for all people.
0.0	0.217034857308	Let me just add to that.
0.0	0.409810259771	We need to get back to training people in this country to do the jobs of the 21st century.
0.0	0.37455617862	You know, some of these -- these engagement rules that the administration has -- "we're not going to bomb a tanker that's coming out of there because there might be a person in it" -- give me a break.
0.0	0.188053051953	And with respect to the 2007 bill, this was Ted Kennedy's bill.
0.0	0.203106545882	So look, corporations ought to exercise some responsibility.
0.0	0.401251694106	I do not believe that we need to wholesale destroy every American citizen's privacy in order to go after those that we know are suspect or are -- are already a problem.
0.0	0.297329496675	The government is not always going to save us and it's not always going to come from government.
0.0	0.120728246054	These are drags on the economy, it's a deliberate drag.
0.0	0.138087532248	Can you believe this?
0.0	0.0224525069303	It is not a suggestion.
0.0	0.378182122496	And when the president of the United States gets out to speak about it, does he support police officers?
0.0	0.262539648801	Those of you health savings accounts.
0.0	0.484851415532	When you have Wall Street spending $5 billion over a 10-year period to get -- to get deregulated, the only answer they know is break them up, reestablish Glass-Stegall.
0.0	0.355264493465	We need to focus our energies there, not these broad, blanket, kind of statements that will make it harder for us to deal with ISIS.
0.0	0.436297154907	But at the same time with new technologies I believe that the people creating these projects -- I mean these products also have an obligation to come together with law enforcement to figure these things out; true to our American principles and values.
0.0	0.222950215884	That is the clear and present danger.
0.0	0.118933865215	Our vets are being treated horribly.
0.0	0.0507316656013	That's really nice.
0.0	0.424062589757	There is one major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.269322997006	So, you know, again, the difference between us and the Republicans is night and day.
0.0	0.248991232509	I'm not running against Governor Bush, I'm not running against anyone on this stage.
0.0	0.21468110958	They are worried to death about the future of their kids.
0.0	0.394055832275	So, I think it's absolutely wrong policy for us to be even imagining we're going end up putting tens of thousands of American troops into Syria and Iraq to fight ISIS.
0.0	0.446190409774	You know, on my very first visit to New Hampshire in this campaign, I was in Keene, and I was asked what are you going to do about the heroin epidemic?
0.0	0.327699027654	It's you see the health insurance companies getting together.
0.0	0.0807362343736	Illegal.
0.0	0.284492095453	But I recall when Secretary Clinton ran against then-Senator Obama, she was critical of him for suggesting that maybe you want to talk to Iran, that you want to talk to our enemies.
0.0	0.479103882617	Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the co-chair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat.
0.0	0.449757569006	Absolutely, they should fight to fund -- defund Planned Parenthood, and I don't think the president should shut down the government simply to send our taxpayer dollars to this group.
0.0	0.308488274674	Well, first of all, I know that the President has appealed the decision to the Supreme Court.
0.0	0.1621100798	He hit oil.
0.0	0.103203793113	So we have work to do.
0.0	0.229472839769	Because the damage he has done to America is extraordinary.
0.0	0.317499600092	I would just say this, we've heard a lot of great ideas up here, and I agree with what Senator Rubio said.
0.0	0.199862788142	And it was not only a great accomplishment of the Democratic Party, but of President Obama.
0.0	0.286019267026	And you say to yourself, "How does that help us," right?
1.0	0.964507798221	You know, the amendment you're talking about is one sentence -- it's 38 words.
0.0	0.128425062465	(LAUGHTER) I'll tell you what.
0.0	0.158277303384	They've been beaten into submission.
0.0	0.107339811828	Marco, please attack Ted.
0.0	0.408993110479	I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators -- back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.
0.0	0.0284016047924	Oh.
0.0	0.0647324301891	I don't want it."
0.0	0.352690646569	I believe that it's most important that we unleash the full potential of women and girls in our society.
0.0	0.273740446069	Well, I think that there are different records.
0.0	0.151314526594	As a senator, yes, I was a senator.
0.0	0.170507887938	You didn't see it for a minute.
0.0	0.156086408298	It was Countrywide Mortgage.
0.0	0.0969528222951	It was a hard choice.
0.0	0.313359641321	The choice between a weak economy and a strong environment is a false choice, that is not the choice I'll offer America.
1.0	0.968969986783	This small country has welcomed in many refugees.
0.0	0.0780507163941	And I watch the speeches.
0.0	0.24104008115	We have people out of work.
0.0	0.448010054184	Keeping the government open and continuing to borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.320623471063	Someone who's going to stand up, and be very clear with our enemies as to the lines their going to draw and stand with them.
0.0	0.143710113296	That is why we need to make...
0.0	0.346955511051	And that means -- and that means radically changing the way we deal with mental health and addiction issues.
0.0	0.0652529917261	I tell you that.
0.0	0.394897775506	And I thought it was horrible when it was broadcast on television, because boy, does that send signals to Putin and all of the other people that look at us and they say, "That is a group of people, and that is a nation that truly has no clue.
0.0	0.359279313276	You find me a Democrat -- you find me a Democrat that will cut spending ten dollars?
0.0	0.300483661861	So, we are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we have to root out in our society.
0.0	0.655890543212	It was...
0.0	0.532365650109	In fact, drove down to three of the four lowest years on record police use of lethal force.
0.0	0.291920760853	But I promise you, in the state of South Carolina, they do.
0.0	0.121980123872	Your name wasn't mentioned, Ted.
0.0	0.219032656206	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.15084167997	You gotta be patient.
0.0	0.433099633923	Every one of us is gifted by God, whether it is those poor babies being picked over or it's someone whose life is tangled up in a web of dependence.
0.0	0.289367622964	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.146118200179	And I'm not blaming these folks -- well, I guess I could.
0.0	0.189580825118	I mean, just think about a scenario like that.
0.0	0.291702733249	I'm running for president, because as I go around this nation, I talk to a lot of people.
0.0	0.314094612026	We're gutting our military, and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were.
0.0	0.444699558698	You have families out there paying 6 percent, 8 percent, 10 percent on student debt, refinance their homes at 3 percent.
0.0	0.0865741777251	Thank you all very much.
0.0	0.310850742698	And it's important that people really look hard at what the threats and dangers we face are, and who is best prepared for dealing with them.
0.0	0.0546749919212	But I know who the pessimist is.
0.0	0.0583096396478	As an outsider, I tackled H.P.
0.0	0.0343592758297	Wait for what?
0.0	0.0599640396104	Think about that.
0.0	0.144154927156	Of course, they would.
0.0	0.188134379092	The other Arab countries have a role to play in this.
0.0	0.308168933233	They can solve the problem of North Korea if they wanted to but they taunt us.
0.0	0.129221085555	Just can't happen.
0.0	0.183681203849	There must be some way.
0.0	0.243196418028	It cannot solely be America's fight.
0.0	0.394897775506	And I thought it was horrible when it was broadcast on television, because boy, does that send signals to Putin and all of the other people that look at us and they say, "That is a group of people, and that is a nation that truly has no clue.
0.0	0.655890543212	That's what he is.
0.0	0.194092925593	And I applaud his record in Maryland.
0.0	0.295292404473	And I had commitments to be at a town hall in New Hampshire.
0.0	0.271509622441	Let me just close it out this way.
0.0	0.379804708935	... put us on firm ground, and has sent us into the future.
0.0	0.255747367847	I have lobbyists that can produce anything for me.
0.0	0.307929504509	We are not the world's policeman, but we need to stand up and be ready.
0.0	0.153516065042	They're terrified by the saber rattling.
0.0	0.286914259423	And I -- I supported him because I think people, when you're elected, you need to do things.
0.0	0.284673325402	... do I go -- let me go first, and then you can please recognize Rand after.
0.0	0.354855915474	Someone who has a proven record, who has been tested, who is totally transparent.
0.0	0.111645316845	Yes, I agree.
0.0	0.212947898511	And I do not believe it's a good idea now.
0.0	0.337709863344	I buy it, because, frankly, I have an obligation to buy it, because they devalue their currency so brilliantly, they just did it recently, and nobody thought they could do it again.
0.0	0.0634406675316	You really can't.
0.0	0.425790003188	We don't need Hillary Clinton's price controls for -- again, does anybody out there think that giving Washington, D.C., the opportunity to run the pharmaceutical industry is a good idea, given how well they have done running the government?
0.0	0.327728510724	(APPLAUSE) They're trying to prevent people from registering to vote.
0.0	0.144292215851	China and Russia have never been on our side of the table.
1.0	0.33417996305	When was the last time you saw a Chevrolet in Tokyo? It doesn't exist, folks.
0.0	0.323343242324	That is the appropriate approach in order to get the results that you are seeking.
0.0	0.250385632899	We need -- we need somebody -- we need somebody that literally will take this country and make it great again.
0.0	0.213960885228	It's interesting that Jeb mentions the book.
0.0	0.34614126252	When I'm president of the United States, we are going to win this war on ISIS.
0.0	0.169406299015	I will tell you that.
0.0	0.406915564428	Our economy -- people are working harder and being left behind.
0.0	0.185088338254	We hear a lot of good plans.
0.0	0.380561545079	Why do we continue to get ripped off by the drug companies who can charge us any prices they want?
0.0	0.472979546663	He might not take my phone call, but he would get the message, and the message is this: Until you open every nuclear and every military facility to full, open, anytime/anywhere, for real, inspections, we are going to make it as difficult as possible for you to move money around the global financial system.
0.0	0.210111079277	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.347911993074	We're not going to be able to rebuild it unless we put a no-fly zone there, make it safe for those folks so we don't have to be talking about Syrian refugees anymore.
0.0	0.276390730036	And the fact is, let law enforcement make those decisions.
0.0	0.397380077891	Just the other day, Russia allowed a television camera to see the plans for a drone submarine that could carry a tactical nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.45126823077	Kathie, that is the kind of economy I believe, put money in the hands of working people, raise the minimum wage to 15 buck an hour.
0.0	0.350334382784	We need to use our technological advantages, because what we've warned of is an international guerrilla movement that threatens this country.
0.0	0.356534417299	I'm interested in making sure we get the maximum amount of revenue from those who can well afford to provide it.
0.0	0.0197792473436	(APPLAUSE)
0.0	0.461333263321	We got it done in my state by leading with principal and that's what we need to do as a party for comprehensive gun safety.
0.0	0.211840340273	Here's the bottom line, and I'll close with this.
0.0	0.0603540811096	Not bad.
0.0	0.0829884287332	I am passionate about what I believe.
0.0	0.444526147082	You think about the regulatory cost and the tax cost -- that's why small businesses are closing, rather than being formed in our country right now.
0.0	0.538523685194	We took the growth of Medicaid from over 10 percent in my second budget to 2.5 percent, without cutting off one person or cutting one benefit, because we -- we innovated the government.
0.0	0.182025803615	And that's why Monday night, what will happen here in Iowa is so important.
0.0	0.302458515493	And I'll tell you what a weakness is of this country: there are a lot of people who are sick and tired because Washington does not play by the same rules that the American people have to play by.
0.0	0.310152543921	You have small businesses in America that are struggling.
0.0	0.340792290798	I mean, she would drive a car until it wouldn't make a sound, and then gather up all her coins and buy a new car.
0.0	0.219823983112	The fact is that this Justice Department under this president has been a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.402385345266	I've had had two town halls, one in Keene, one in Laconia, dedicated exclusively to talking about what we can do.
0.0	0.304615583789	They're going to take away thousands of jobs.
0.0	0.139431138469	Folks, it's not too late.
1.0	0.934838866232	Secondly, I never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
1.0	0.456817737793	And they've stolen from you because now they know they cannot pay these benefits and Social Security is going to be insolvent in seven to eight years.
0.0	0.221996982411	Now, we're going to blame the people.
0.0	0.332964945324	... that after the 9/11 attacks, Secretary Rumsfeld invited me to the Pentagon with a meeting of the former secretaries of Defense.
0.0	0.433574716559	So what we have tried to do and what President Obama succeeded in doing was to build on the health care system we have, get us to 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.264807257322	I think we need to put in some armored brigades there.
0.0	0.018332491627	It's a joke.
0.0	0.294261496739	Who has the experience, who has the knowledge, who has the judgement, who has the clarity, and vision and strength of resolve to keep this country safe.
0.0	0.407299841709	There have been more than 4,000 changes to the tax plan since 2001 alone.
0.0	0.348322929974	On January 20th, 2017, the next president of the United States will walk into the White House.
0.0	0.0869059478512	That's right.
0.0	0.102088581518	I'm too agreeable, easy going.
0.0	0.106579638187	I've gotta do it."
0.0	0.238019989564	You know why three?
0.0	0.335760631078	-- at least half of the things Marco said are flat-out false.
0.0	0.438929734552	And he led the charge to finally fix this immigration problem that has existed now for, as Marco says, for 30 years.
0.0	0.389104747539	And the people in New York fought and fought and fought, and we saw more death, and even the smell of death -- nobody understood it.
0.0	0.305005629034	And for the sake of our economy, they must -- the major banks must be broken up.
0.0	0.135751425749	You should not have to borrow a dime to pay tuition.
0.0	0.272329024615	I mean, that's just the bottom line.
0.0	0.411487000996	Marco made the choice to go the direction of the major donors -- to support amnesty because he thought it was politically advantageous.
0.0	0.393003117431	And that's what you'll hear from Hillary Clinton -- and I've already heard from her -- is that, send more money in Social Security, send more money in Medicare taxes, send more money for Medicaid, and that's gonna solve the problem.
0.0	0.218332043516	Let me just say this.
0.0	0.426450773797	I've set forth very specific plans about how to get costs down, especially prescription drug costs.
0.0	0.228404484997	I don't see how he can possibly get the nomination.
0.0	0.115892549362	We don't have victories anymore.
0.0	0.151319916207	No, I didn't care (inaudible).
1.0	0.979645668347	They don't want to pay 35 percent tax on the way back.
0.0	0.0833562882533	We're dying.
0.0	0.105386230143	Do you remember that, everybody?
0.0	0.139424896929	I think I am a nice person.
0.0	0.26025110463	I'm not going to have something that Ted described in his tax plan.
0.0	0.343447163827	... believe me the world is peanuts by comparison.
0.0	0.374053279236	How can we beat an enemy if our commander-in-chief doesn't have the moral honesty and clarity to say that Islam has a problem, and that problem is radical Islam, to say they've got to condemn not generic acts of violence, but the individual murderers who are committing these acts of violence.
0.0	0.137705441782	So, we have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.141522225895	You've heard some of those tonight.
0.0	0.268250161291	We should be relying upon the leadership of the Congress to pass the laws.
0.0	0.0831588550779	OK, good.
0.0	0.328136272474	He'll say, "Mr. President, we've decided to move the plant back to the United States, and we're not going to build it in Mexico."
0.0	0.226115533397	Nobody -- I could stand up here all night.
0.0	0.208224154382	Listen, we -- this is the greatest country in the history of mankind.
0.0	0.229834391685	People that know me, like me.
0.0	0.274240205765	We will renew America if we work together, and I am totally confident that we will.
0.0	0.383076430832	We are not going to round up and deport 12 million people, but we're not going to hand out citizenship cards, either.
0.0	0.415896585193	We got to do a lot about the high cost of high -- higher education, but we've got to make sure we're training people for jobs that exist, that are good jobs that can pay.
0.0	0.389514626126	We now have much more information about what must be done to fix our criminal justice system.
0.0	0.420126641388	And we just got to make sure that every American has the tools, in K-through-12 and in vocational education, in higher education.
1.0	0.903665973687	Today, we have about 4,000.
0.0	0.35003108518	I want to -- before my time runs out I want to get back to this issue of ISIS versus Iran.
0.0	0.153060050918	She's the senator from New York.
0.0	0.432255176223	I go further in the plan that I've proposed, which has been called the toughest, most effective, comprehensive plan for reining in the other risks that the financial system could face.
0.0	0.0109382915112	You don't have to.
0.0	0.301164326571	What I said was I don't believe that I would be president of the United States and have the same dysfunction that exists in Washington, D.C. now.
0.0	0.454416545523	To the 1 percent who have been fighting this war for over a decade, I'd try my best to be a commander-in-chief worthy of your sacrifice.
0.0	0.490032152056	So when you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration -- which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother -- clearly, we are looking at institutional racism.
0.0	0.0352614653232	I have no idea.
0.0	0.323151577465	People in Washington think they were sent there to be adults and govern and do all this.
0.0	0.39297593879	Well, first of all, I had a national reporter say, you know, there's three lanes.
0.0	0.201671125202	Because most of the time, they're absolutely correct.
0.0	0.190023477644	And I'm saying we have to get to the bottom of it.
0.0	0.0349525457973	How would we act?
0.0	0.173221087615	... And that I am not a great fan of regime change.
0.0	0.0599317197074	Break them up.
0.0	0.221976784652	So it wasn't just me who opposed it.
0.0	0.0818249122274	That's what Chris Stevens was trying to do.
0.0	0.0769619581498	Washington is broken.
0.0	0.366891969531	Community has to understand that that police officer wants to get home at night, and not -- not to lose their life.

0.0	0.380766143869	No, what I would say is this is look, I was the first of the three of us to call for America to accept the 65,000 refugees we were asked to accept.
0.0	0.247206017731	And -- and I guess I can -- can frame it another way.

0.0	0.277952914238	We've been struggling to get this done since Harry Truman.
0.0	0.296290320044	The business model of Wall Street is fraud.
0.0	0.314583588362	You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president...
0.0	0.315800938376	I think our country is tired of the politicians who simply read the polls and fail to lead.
0.0	0.267351766833	The government has tried it their way.
0.0	0.229750678924	So, you know, it's fine for you to say what you're going to say, but I looked very carefully at your proposal.
0.0	0.279112373346	In fact, if my mother were secretary of treasury, we would not be in a deficit situation.
0.0	0.106615100763	Look at my family.
0.0	0.0889591580131	This guy is a petulant child.
0.0	0.19991628997	So what if children are going hungry?
0.0	0.41776297967	Here is the story -- it's not just the college graduates should be $50,000 or $100,000 in debt.
0.0	0.314050901879	The point I'm making is this, the Federal Government should not be in a lot of things.
0.0	0.301824125444	... We're never going to win elections if we don't have a more broader unifying message.
0.0	0.446178038114	And we will not, under this proposal, have a situation that we have right now with the Affordable Care Act where you have states like South Carolina, and many other Republican states, that because of their right wing political ideology, are denying millions of people the expansion of Medicaid that we passed in the Affordable Care Act.
0.0	0.085920970374	Yes.
0.0	0.393036184894	I think what we need is a commander in chief who is focused like a laser on keeping this country safe and on defeating radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.350653949602	I don't think it's so much about when the government orders a corporation to do something.

0.0	0.12247888462	Might I respond?
0.0	0.271808361761	So the crisis was I lost what I wanted.
0.0	0.0402701853988	OK...
0.0	0.317211161489	And when we live by those laws and we treat everybody equally under the law, that's when people feel good about being Americans.
1.0	0.516394228755	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.

0.0	0.127405210575	I'm against anything that's bad for my mother.
0.0	0.422240720421	Second of all what we do, is you raise the minimum wage to living wage, 15 bucks an hour over the next several years.
0.0	0.293588547358	Because the more you tax something, the less of it you get.
0.0	0.0869059478512	That's right.
1.0	0.974369105321	Gun people said, there were three candidates in the race, you vote for one of the others, but not Bernie Sanders.
0.0	0.185296723584	If I could just respond.
0.0	0.317658051812	But I agree with Jeb, you can't just do this by growing the economy.
0.0	0.306420867127	You know, of the few questions I've got, the last one I need is to give him some more time.
0.0	0.203378911615	We're going to have people come in, but they're coming in legally.
0.0	0.407618181324	Are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the Assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire?
0.0	0.232180828629	The dictatorships have suppressed people's aspirations.
0.0	0.369155090668	... and in this case, we probably let our lust for regime toppling get ahead of the practical considerations for stability in that region.
0.0	0.251868613717	I will be the Ronald Reagan if I can find a Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.299086259178	And we are in a situation right now in our country that we have never been in before.
0.0	0.0207956512618	I love the Saudis.
0.0	0.382091579039	Wall Street today has too much political power.
1.0	0.972415022349	They were wrong.
0.0	0.388545455501	So, yes, we must talk about our ideas to move our economy forward, but the first job of the president of the United States is to protect the people of the United States.
0.0	0.454625792099	Right now, corporations, by the thousands, are thinking of leaving our country with the jobs -- leave them behind.
0.0	0.358715930293	And sadly, in America today, in our economy, a whole lot of those poor people are African-American.
0.0	0.3079737314	We have more Americans out of work or just Americans who quit looking for work for 40 years.
0.0	0.320122127195	The fact is -- and if for some reason he beats the rest of the field, he beats the rest of the field (inaudible).
0.0	0.369799098349	The endorsements that I'm proud of are conservative leaders like Dr. James Dobson, and over 700,000 contributions nationwide, people going to our Web site, tedcruz.org.
0.0	0.239595447926	Just want to get that out there, just saying.
0.0	0.25420300048	Because you realize that people depending on you.
0.0	0.411945078632	I will immediately terminate President Obama's illegal executive order on immigration, immediately.
0.0	0.0346674489487	That's not fair.
0.0	0.398836317501	But I think in Syria the primary focus now must be on destroying ISIS and working over the years to get rid of Assad.
0.0	0.412989966263	Secretary Clinton has been going around the country saying Bernie Sanders wants to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, people are going to lose their MedicAid, they're going to lose their CHIP program.
0.0	0.206469786963	I think we all support that.
0.0	0.166268924321	You want to talk about moral authority.
0.0	0.211470634857	That is what the Democrats in the Senate have put forward as a proposal.
1.0	0.0997500686892	Believe me, that is why Ohio is doing well.
0.0	0.400364670179	On September 11, my wife was two blocks from the World Trade Center.
0.0	0.27277230553	We can triple the border patrol.
0.0	0.369383450198	And its bankruptcy and its failure nearly destroyed us.
0.0	0.189670547112	Let me, you know, again, respectfully disagree with Secretary Clinton here.
0.0	0.389126933861	Well, Megyn, let me say at the outset to the men and women of Iowa, thank you for the incredible hospitality over this past year.
0.0	0.264012339592	I think he would have said bring back a 21st-century Glass-Steagall legislation.
0.0	0.415702338798	Target the efforts for people that are committing crimes with guns, and if you do that, and get it right, you're going to be much better off than creating a political argument where there's a big divide.
0.0	0.295974459066	I think that sets us apart from a lot of what's happening right now on the Republican side.
0.0	0.510056968167	Mine actually cuts the payroll tax, and I think it would spread the tax cut across all socioeconomic levels, and would allow then it to be something that would be broadly supported by the public in an election.
0.0	0.289890904049	And I think the focus ought to be on making sure that we leave this nomination process, as wild and woolly as it's going to be -- this is not being bad.
0.0	0.276366707249	Are you coming onboard a proposal?
0.0	0.414761954341	A healthy environment, a strong economy and energy independent America -- that would be the purpose of my presidency, is break the strangle hold that people enjoy on fossil fuels who hate our guts.
0.0	0.16260168324	That's exactly what we saw.
0.0	0.343425652497	First and foremost, this issue has to be now more than anything else about keeping America safe.
0.0	0.343236883088	The problem is that Barack Obama has made law enforcement the enemy, Hillary Clinton has made law enforcement the enemy.
0.0	0.121341703354	That's the end of the conversation.
0.0	0.213911650057	When you're a governor, you're held accountable for everything you do.
0.0	0.369286576775	Eradicate those and you fix Medicare and you've fixed America, its economy and you've made people's lives a heck of a lot better.
0.0	0.169208432285	But I believe in the Teddy Roosevelt philosophy.
0.0	0.172922217562	That's not the America that I've ever known.
0.0	0.145377513623	This is the fantasy that I talked about in the beginning.
0.0	0.320880730686	We will see what the American people are willing to support.
0.0	0.415068522332	In fact, in the last debate, very shamefully, she tried to hide her cozy relationship with Wall Street big banks by invoking the attacks of 9/11.
0.0	0.273752865879	And the politicians always say it is so complicated, nobody but a politician can figure it out.
0.0	0.441063836993	Drugs is one of the greatest scourge in this country, and I spent five years of my administration working with my team to do a whole sort of things to try to reign in the problem of overdoses, and it goes on and on.
0.0	0.276665023157	You know, when Senator Sanders talks about a coalition, I agree with him about that.
0.0	0.250648234682	We don't want to be like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.387111441086	Now, there has been a lot of turmoil and trouble as they have tried to deal with these radical elements which you find in this arc of instability, from north Africa to Afghanistan.
0.0	0.351156132001	We've cut taxes, balanced budgets, changed the regulatory environment.
0.0	0.312928778795	I'm going to prioritize those recipients who need the most help first.
0.0	0.0402701853988	OK.
0.0	0.392470759109	We had this failed red line with Assad and it discouraged folks that want to help us on the ground.
0.0	0.0745453942142	And you know what?
0.0	0.20371114299	We have to put more money.
0.0	0.218321585677	And some, I assume, are good people.
0.0	0.158551041884	What he wants is something to get done.
0.0	0.379776208002	First of all, I'd like to recognize Governor Haley for her incredible leadership in the aftermath of the --
0.0	0.10962421255	You gotta be -- stick with it, and all that.
0.0	0.23560364571	I don't see a lot of weakness on this stage, quite frankly.
0.0	0.140948880371	We could overthrow Assad tomorrow if we wanted to.
0.0	0.0612460453519	I am advocating...
0.0	0.269052691856	Remember, we have 645 federal agencies and sub-agencies.
0.0	0.223451059426	And I'm going to tell you, that it -- I'm going to suggest to you here tonight, that you can't do on the job training.
0.0	0.180344257196	That's a hard road to walk.
0.0	0.316039012365	It enables us to eliminate the death tax.
1.0	0.970248928827	And then in Ohio, of course, I had to bring about big reform, again, because we were so far in the hole and now we just found out we are up over 400,000 jobs since I took over as governor.
0.0	0.158634787698	And, the only way -- no...
0.0	0.341888695373	You look at the kind of damage that two people that two people that got married, they were radicalized -- they got married, they killed 15 people in actually 15 -- going to be probably 16 but you look at that and you take a look -- a good strong look and that's what we have.
0.0	0.190532730459	But then his poll numbers tanked.
0.0	0.101642504387	They started in Iowa.
0.0	0.0598560391505	This is not entitlement, it's not welfare.
0.0	0.0596838221494	It's peanuts.
0.0	0.205473056525	I'm glad that late last night, that was resolved.
0.0	0.369169263901	And the issue is, the problem is, the front pages every day were dealing with it.
0.0	0.280254995435	We were attacked in downtown Manhattan where Wall Street is.
0.0	0.271531118283	The first line of defense against radicalization is in Muslim-American community.
0.0	0.258785252649	And I -- I thought, if I didn't jump in, I might not be able to tell everybody this.
0.0	0.274898018634	But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work.
0.0	0.364022114086	Yes, I thought about running four years ago.
0.0	0.285126061394	And one more point, one more point.
0.0	0.378349310512	This issue now has to be about stopping ISIS entering the United States, and when I'm president we will.
1.0	0.134522346566	They cite Obamacare.
1.0	0.959694652461	They knew that they were talking about trying to take our country and attack it.
0.0	0.214486027592	I believe if the amendments I introduced were adopted, that the bill would pass.
0.0	0.28435493919	You know, when President Obama was elected, I said, "Well, the one thing, I think he'll do well.
0.0	0.184530496331	All of those things are important, and all those things would happen in a Christie administration.
0.0	0.145486834344	I am still sick and tired of Hillary Clinton's e-mails.
0.0	0.420042979087	It's no longer enough just to say the vast majority of Americans want common sense gun safety measures including gun owners.
0.0	0.352628945506	When I'm president of the United States, we are defending the Second Amendment, not undermining it the way Barack Obama does.
0.0	0.315817402039	We now have a 73,000-page tax code.
0.0	0.125564794192	in particular.
0.0	0.362608818557	There is a war against ISIS, not just against ISIS but against radical jihadists terrorists, and it is a war that they win or we win.
0.0	0.263961839529	This is incredibly complicated, because we've got Iran as a big player, in addition to Russia.

0.0	0.396685637431	I've watched to see people say that we should dismantle Medicare and Medicaid and leave the senior citizens out -- out in the -- in the cold.
0.0	0.486407028743	There is no question in my mind that if we summon our resources, both our leadership resources and all of the tools at our disposal, not just military force, which should be used as a last resort, but our diplomacy, our development aid, law enforcement, sharing of intelligence in a much more open and cooperative way -- that we can bring people together.
1.0	0.986329743364	The cost of college education is escalating a lot faster than the cost of inflation.
0.0	0.655890543212	It is.
0.0	0.372314840746	We can get back in the game to restore order and security for our own country.
0.0	0.252282499323	But we're running for the presidency of the United States here.
0.0	0.29099183429	If they had guns, he wouldn't be around very long.
0.0	0.340767863868	Our country is being run by incompetent people.
0.0	0.429520559491	And the only reason we got them back is because we owed them with a stupid deal, $150 billion.
0.0	0.345424103359	We need comprehensive gun safety legislation and a ban on assault weapons.
0.0	0.0315964403598	With all the candidates, why me?
0.0	0.403286119321	And when countries violate trade agreements or dump product in this country, we need -- we need to stand up against those countries that do that without making them into an enemy.
0.0	0.35465447684	Because the General Services, who are terrific people, by the way, and talented people, they wanted to do a great job.
0.0	0.153514882051	You see, ladies and gentlemen, at the end of the day, I'm an optimist
0.0	0.177426699354	... and I'd like to respond.
0.0	0.0900868453375	That's kind of a no-brainer.
0.0	0.296997605692	Well, gee, after the last debate, I was told that I didn't smile enough.
0.0	0.279644654137	For both of them you have to gradually raise the age.
0.0	0.143667182241	They are the ones who should respond to any questions.
0.0	0.21221558368	I never said that.
0.0	0.350991008431	At the same time we're doing all that, the Pentagon must be reformed so we get what we need for our men and women in uniform.
0.0	0.322963349578	I stood yesterday with 75 construction workers.
0.0	0.397229394786	How about we get the government to do what they're supposed to be doing, secure our borders, protect our people, and support American values and American families.
0.0	0.230863131335	I just don't think it would get the job done.
0.0	0.243027003027	And it's going to get worse, because remember, Obamacare really kicks in in '16, 2016.
0.0	0.0891831704411	Now I'm not doing that...I'm not doing that to brag, because you know what?
0.0	0.0553047784825	And guess what?
0.0	0.400787600207	We've cut 26 percent of our budget.
0.0	0.241199723155	The immediate -- it is not Assad who is attacking the United States.
0.0	0.384304703978	We need leadership, someone who has a backbone and sticks with things, rather than just talks about them as though anything matters when you're talking about amendments that don't even actually are part of a bill that ever passed.
0.0	0.296475258957	I think, frankly, if you have border security, you can have legalization.
0.0	0.113646971687	This is a watershed election.
0.0	0.245647982106	You don't know it, they tax us.
0.0	0.398150222859	Because, first of all, you may rename the IRS but you are not going to abolishes the IRS, because there has to be some agency that's going to collect your vat tax.
0.0	0.334289208576	I mean, all of us support funding Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.481904210487	Why is it that we are -- why is it that we spend almost three times per capita as to what they spend in the U.K., 50 percent more than what they pay in France, countries that guarantee health care to all of their people and in many cases, have better health care outcomes.
0.0	0.416518314577	Look at what happened in '08, AIG, a big insurance company, Lehman Brothers, an investment bank helped to bring our economy down.
0.0	0.388805835476	We're borrowing a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.0853077522316	We didn't spend any.
0.0	0.155611762416	The planes are older than the pilots.
0.0	0.310144394712	And by the way, Jeb you mentioned Boeing, take a look.
0.0	0.199940036627	Well, I'm very happy to get a question this early on.
0.0	0.298715910758	The final observation, invoked Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.525003974793	I have never heard a candidate never, who has received huge amounts of money from oil, from coal, from Wall Street, from the military industrial complex, not one candidate say, oh, these campaign contributions will not influence me.
0.0	0.273047321606	He got endorsed by the Sun-Sentinel because he was the most talented guy in the field.
0.0	0.204400366566	He doesn't want to hear the talk about politics Megyn and who is establishment and who is grassroots.
0.0	0.275767038278	Now, you'd have to ask yourself, why are they running ads against me?
0.0	0.268368407621	Trust has been totally lost in a lot of places.
0.0	0.407974108661	Next thing we do, pay equity for women workers.
1.0	0.12153612296	It doesn't exist, folks.
0.0	0.387423402295	Where did it ever say in the Constitution, where is it written that it's the job of the United States of America or its secretary of State to determine when dictators have to go?
0.0	0.201390752701	So that's what I'm focused on, that's what I've outlined and that's what I would do as president.
0.0	0.0393289316026	So I have voiced criticisms.
0.0	0.276366901148	They know we will be committed to victory.
0.0	0.146681078773	It was a terrible sight.
0.0	0.171331868526	I believe we've got to go further.
0.0	0.408547118527	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.459118819518	That is a dramatic tax decrease for hard-working people who run their own businesses.
0.0	0.356689521605	I think America is just a few good decisions and a leadership change at the top away from the best years we've ever had.
0.0	0.364289990183	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.140511386535	Our rights come from God.
0.0	0.451702359313	Marco's top tax rate is 35 percent.
0.0	0.159565910088	(APPLAUSE) This is not a cage match.
0.0	0.455019450441	But I combine this also with the millions upon millions of dollars they've taken from regimes in the Middle East who treat women like cattle.
0.0	0.0231084746658	And that's what I intend to do.
0.0	0.114957417868	The answer is simple.
0.0	0.346941780646	Women are not charged more than men any longer for our health insurance.
0.0	0.427843831162	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.0869059478512	Right?
0.0	0.375778012317	Well, look the Joint Terrorism Task Force needs resources and tools.
0.0	0.278259487415	As president I will restore and rebuild our military, restore the alliances and keep us safe.
0.0	0.0544562551991	I don't have to brag.
0.0	0.274179723157	First of all, yes, we've stolen.
0.0	0.098688978103	I love Donald Trump.
1.0	0.275629158008	I don't recall the Sun -- in fact, the Sun-Sentinel endorsed him.
0.0	0.302363878646	She'd be a great president of the United States because the leadership she brought to H.P.
0.0	0.190342262983	That's not why I ran for office.
0.0	0.393963516875	When millions of Americans rose up against Planned Parenthood, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.0677427693794	There's the establishment lane, the anti- establishment lane, and then there's the Kasich lane.
0.0	0.123401082761	Came out great.
0.0	0.336534575241	You know, in our country, there are a lot of people who feel as though they just don't have the power.
0.0	0.0534973198596	How has it worked?
0.0	0.194823308211	They don't buy their guns from a collector.
0.0	0.0879120724229	Oh, great.
0.0	0.13445215162	That's not the role of the government.
0.0	0.406026488062	It is about understanding the secondary and third consequences that fall next.
0.0	0.00430451372677	Thank you.
0.0	0.301174359471	Anyone can go online at tedcruz.org and read exactly what it said.
0.0	0.434315585869	And specifically said to Wall Street, that what they were doing in the mortgage market was bringing our country down.
0.0	0.249531579409	Not solely ours, but we must work collaboratively with other nations.
0.0	0.338968382177	So if we want to pick and choose -- and I certainly do -- people I listen to, people I don't listen to, people I listen to for certain areas, then I think we have to be fair and look at the entire world, because it's a big, complicated world out there.
0.0	0.140004279699	I didn't find it offensive at all.
0.0	0.492280847374	I went into Ohio where we had an $8 billion hole and now we have a $2 billion surplus.
0.0	0.284020117041	But -- but we are going to end the absurdity, as Warren Buffet often remind us.
0.0	0.357269792227	I would suggest to you that we need to leave the Cold War behind us, and we need to put together new alliances and new approaches to dealing with this, and we need to restrain ourselves.
0.0	0.411393565502	Today, we have a legal immigration system for permanent residency that is largely based on whether or not you have a relative living here.
1.0	0.507058527312	In fact, the largest after- tax gains is for the people at the lower end of the tax spectrum under my plan.
1.0	0.169298050817	They're bringing crime.
0.0	0.419614030769	Secretary Clinton also said we -- it was not just the invasion of Iraq which Secretary Clinton voted for and has since said was a big mistake -- and, indeed, it was.
0.0	0.329421579948	Because if you are, you need to elect someone who's deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.443442502306	And what I think all of us are saying is, our monetary policy, our tax policy, regulatory policy needs to be radically changed so we can create high sustained growth for income to rise.
0.0	0.268860215916	This is one of the great tragedies in our country today.
0.0	0.189465233915	You know, this is not easy work.
0.0	0.3418288926	In fact, Ronald Reagan's treasury, when Ronald Reagan's treasury looked at the vat tax, you know what they found?
0.0	0.115466985852	We needed 60.
0.0	0.109420991186	Go ahead.
0.0	0.242602995937	It appears that the same someone who has been whispering in old Marco's ear too.
0.0	0.289401658762	Well, this is going to be a show me, don't tell me election.
0.0	0.145649846273	He wants to change America.
0.0	0.432731842667	And then in addition to that, the American people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.494000938549	Results count, and as governor, I pushed Florida up to the top in terms of jobs, income and small business growth.
0.0	0.0642864296492	I got that.
0.0	0.311097714272	Let me tell you, if we don't get this election right, there may be no turning back for America.
0.0	0.383290710447	But if we elect the right person -- if you elect me -- we will turn this country around, we will reclaim the American dream and this nation will be stronger and greater than it has ever been.
0.0	0.0226720661381	Yeah.
0.0	0.0968817033557	The Shi'a-Sunni split.
0.0	0.415382903958	And anyone who lies to the families of Americans who have died in the service of this country can never be commander-in-chief of the United States.
0.0	0.163139833468	That is why Hillary Clinton cannot win this election.
0.0	0.255971232522	Our healthcare is a horror show.
1.0	0.921890089506	The reason we are in the mess we're in, that ISIS has the territory it has, is because of Assad.
0.0	0.20747263278	We have been debating right here the core difference between conservatism and progressivism.
0.0	0.367149428192	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.192171059997	I would put it in a blind trust.
0.0	0.447151473497	Well, first of all, when we talk about the Import Export Bank, it's time to clean up corporate welfare.
0.0	0.246682277644	Why didn't they turn those two people in so that you wouldn't have had all the death?
0.0	0.147942525061	And second of all...
0.0	0.209953895292	And as I looked out there at the eyes of our neighbors, I also looked in the eyes of veterans.
0.0	0.10766919423	He consistently underestimates it but I do not.
0.0	0.247209784586	Everybody thought the deal was dead.
0.0	0.242949814124	All we need to do is protect them, they will be in their own country.
0.0	0.0388294030226	A Republican Congress did that.
0.0	0.366226247603	Well, you know, I think, from a historical point of view, somebody with my background, somebody with my views, somebody who has spent his entire life taking on the big money interests, I think a Sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment, as well.
0.0	0.318864846801	So let's demand open trade but fair trade in this country.
0.0	0.33325181628	But if I get elected president I will bring it back bigger and better and stronger than ever before, and we will make America great again.
0.0	0.30773081738	They order planes, they make Boeing build their plant in China.
0.0	0.425599835615	And if at the end of 18 months, 24 months there are people who have been cleared, and I would prioritize widows, and orphans, and the elderly, people who may have relatives, families, or have nowhere else to go.
1.0	0.928998048931	It looked like very few women.
0.0	0.304680799041	They've been stepped on for too long in this society, and we are beginning to treat them.
0.0	0.5	Never have and never will support any effort to grant blanket legalization amnesty to folks who have entered, or stayed in this country illegally.
0.0	0.201011826783	Let people play, who cares?
0.0	0.154334065486	We have to do this in unison with the Arab world.
0.0	0.167923804555	Can I -- can I -- I just...
0.0	0.211632173649	Somebody said to me the other day, a reporter, a very nice reporter, "But, Mr. Trump, you're not a nice person."
0.0	0.424577133241	Well first of all, I think it's important that when we're running for the highest office in the land that we recognize that we're living in dangerous times and we have to be serious about it, that our words have consequences.
0.0	0.348274927087	But we need to leave the Cold War and that sort of antiquated thinking behind.
0.0	0.282359395222	But what happened is a political vacuum developed.
0.0	0.51475484565	What I would like for the media now is for us to be talking about why the middle class is disappearing, why we have more people in jail than any other country, why we have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, and we're the only major country on Earth without paid family and medical leave.
0.0	0.226659812995	Because Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama.
0.0	0.351574681409	And, it was made for we the people, we are the ones who decide who we are, and we should never give away the values and principles that made America into a great nation for the sake of political correctness.
0.0	0.294504844485	And Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will say it's those evil rich people.
0.0	0.124536555459	Let's hope that it holds.
0.0	0.318287262904	We actually passed a living wage.
0.0	0.450149927698	Yes, does Wall Street and big financial interests, along with drug companies, insurance companies, big oil, all of it, have too much influence?
0.0	0.2167482665	Now I want to go back something.
0.0	0.449053395251	And that's the difference between being a governor and having done that for the last six years in New Jersey and being someone who has never had to be responsible for any of those decisions.
0.0	0.22843075243	Chris Christie wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.249451593007	Look, I have said I want to be the president for the struggling, the striving and the successful.
0.0	0.363852938199	The age will have to gradually rise, there is no question.
0.0	0.407471092824	But the fact is, every single engine of government has to move when you see a crisis like that.
0.0	0.408243883241	I've heard about tax schemes that don't add up, that put our kids in -- in a deeper hole than they are today.
0.0	0.363814530509	And it is now being put into place everyplace across the state of Ohio.
0.0	0.0733108273811	Maybe you haven't.
0.0	0.0490639862774	So, so important.
0.0	0.316396101445	So, we're going to enforce the law, we're going to change policing practices, we're going to change incarceration practices, but we're also going to emphasize education, jobs, and housing.
0.0	0.159682027272	You have a bigger problem with China.
0.0	0.405192860831	And in the Holy Land Foundation trial in 2006 in Texas, they had a memorandum, an explanatory memorandum that talked about the fact that Americans would be easy to overcome and to commit civilization jihad because they were going to be trying to protect the rights of the very people who were trying to subvert them.
0.0	0.240805206825	I will be that new leader.
0.0	0.350262778663	She wouldn't just be a disaster, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being commander in chief of the United States.
0.0	0.484414724875	I'm running for president because we have a campaign finance system which is corrupt, where billionaires are spending hundreds of millionaires of dollars to buy candidates who will represent their interests rather than the middle class and working families.
0.0	0.245492580207	So, yes, we can talk about it as a racial issue.
0.0	0.290807965284	The central question in this race is trust.
0.0	0.401172275118	And we must substantially lower, as my legislation does, interest rates on student debt.
0.0	0.123185877414	I made it when I ran in 2008.
0.0	0.257172464183	Everybody just needs to get used to it.
1.0	0.967495573409	I would note that Art Laffer, Ronald Reagan's chief economic adviser, has written publicly, that my simple flat tax is the best tax plan of any of the individuals on this stage cause it produces economic growth, it raises wages and it helps everyone from the very poorest to the very richest.
0.0	0.298767161334	And there is no nation on the planet better able to adapt to this change than our nation.
0.0	0.370564279867	And specifically, we know that we could have detected and repelled some of these cyber attacks if that collaboration had been permitted.
0.0	0.5	And in terms of seniors, there are millions of seniors -- and I've talked to them in my state of Vermont and all over this country -- who are trying to get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year Social Security.
0.0	0.400718934245	And the people who are often the most hard-hit are widows, because when their spouse dies, they can lose up to one-half of their Social Security monthly payment.
0.0	0.0782472593469	I don't care.
0.0	0.183263475495	And I won't be angry when we fix it, but until we fix it, I'm very, very angry.
0.0	0.33946349518	If you -- we will not solve our nation's problems by resorting to the divisive ideologies of our past, or by returning to polarizing figures from our past.
0.0	0.346321144684	In the 21st century, it has to be more of a merit-based system, and that is why our legal immigration system is in need of modernization.
0.0	0.348424173482	But where we have a disagreement is that I think if you look at the history of regime changes, you go back to Mossaddegh (ph) in Iran, you go back to Salvador Allende who we overthrew in Chile, you go back to overthrowing Saddam Hussein in Iraq, you go back to where we are today in Syria with a dictator named Assad.
0.0	0.189532140335	That's when we become a country that's unsalvageable.
0.0	0.348637318376	But, what we did is we said to the working families of this country, look, we know things are tough, but if you want to help us go beyond establishment politics, and establishment economics, send us something.
0.0	0.318963352553	There's only a promise to pay by the next generation, and the next generation's not big enough to pay it.
0.0	0.17891150586	What part is valid?
0.0	0.381186732507	And we need to change the way we do law enforcement, and of course, we need more programs and facilities, so when somebody is ready to get help, there's a place for them to go.
0.0	0.230594853819	Obamacare, we're going to repeal it and replace it.
0.0	0.134542068414	And you're not serious about destroying ISIL.

0.0	0.359880763032	Well, if that's the case, we're going to win every state, if Bernie Sanders is the nominee.
0.0	0.139439770246	That's what I've done in Louisiana, that's what I'll do in America.
0.0	0.415991740012	And I will pay for it by, yes, taxing the wealthy more, closing corporate loopholes, deductions, and other kinds of favorable treatment.
0.0	0.655890543212	...

0.0	0.0615901460345	And I hear their speeches.
0.0	0.306953311584	It's campaign -- a corrupt campaign finance system.
0.0	0.0640083006391	They're very concerned about it.
0.0	0.327431398971	We elected someone as president who wants to change America, who wants to make it more like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.056819870953	Bigger than that?
0.0	0.233901036256	But we shouldn't be the ones declaring that Assad must go.
0.0	0.089854938728	It will not happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.0277462445194	Look--
0.0	0.311664569923	And -- and -- and I -- you know, Ben is absolutely right in saying that what we don't need to do is to send more money to Washington, D.C. to fix this problem.
0.0	0.655890543212	No.
0.0	0.124997813559	We are at war with violent extremism.
0.0	0.327598204537	I would hold a Camp David summit with our Arab allies, not to talk them into this lousy deal with Iran, but to say to them, "what is it that you need to defeat ISIL?"
0.0	0.41748052003	Yeah, but that -- because the math is, if you -- 5 percent of a million is a lot more than 5 percent of a thousand.
0.0	0.3721839135	How about one that I've done in New Jersey for the last six years.
0.0	0.40710901882	We have talked about tax reform in every single election for decades.

0.0	0.393414161487	Well, there is no question that some people go overboard when it comes to trying to make profits, and they don't take into consideration the American people.
0.0	0.0733049799103	Nobody.
0.0	0.0532549681816	It is a complicated relationship.
0.0	0.0724218833067	I think if it doesn't...
0.0	0.114298904396	I'd consider it.
0.0	0.383564350464	Against the Republican leadership, who all thought it would be a great idea to merge investor banks and commercial banks and large insurance companies.
0.0	0.040489054287	They expect to have it.
0.0	0.258235933575	Well, because you can do it without profiling, Megyn, when you do it on the facts.
1.0	0.955773669155	It enabled him -- the president to certify them en masse without mandating meaningful background checks.
0.0	0.37674021517	Now I think an area in kind of a vague way, or not so vague, where Secretary Clinton and I disagree is the area of regime change.
0.0	0.210903846481	We just want to be the rich."
0.0	0.150244590753	I didn't want guns.
0.0	0.0686824740563	That's what our parents and grandparents always did.
0.0	0.254114686025	But Saudi Arabia is in big, big trouble.
0.0	0.478288139198	When you have six financial institutions in this country that issue two-thirds of the credit cards and one-third of the mortgages, when three out of four of them are larger today than when we bailed them out because they are too big to fail, we've got to re- establish Glass-Steagall, we have got to break the large financial institutions up.
0.0	0.246438537163	Instead, the Washington establishment raised both.
0.0	0.352015823996	Well, (inaudible) the major issue right now is whether or not we reestablish Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.265986976367	Making fun of disabled people...
0.0	0.366184538765	Obviously, Mrs. Obama has been a terrific leader when it comes to young people's health, particularly nutrition and exercise.
0.0	0.17579818831	They are not going to go away on their own.
0.0	0.384580015227	And when FDR said, "Yeah, it is," that we're going to use all of the resources that we have to create jobs, to build homes, to feed people, to protect the farmers, we are a nation which if we come together there is nothing that we could not accomplish.
0.0	0.38810219764	Let me tell you something, when you see thousands upon thousands upon thousands of children being murdered in the womb, I can't think of anything better than that.
0.0	0.271071999795	We need to invest more in terms of the other sort of visas and the other sort of waivers.
0.0	0.217319546695	That's why I ask for your support for president.
0.0	0.329728452648	This is the new sort of challenge, the new sort of threat that does, in fact, require new thinking, fresh approaches and new leadership.
0.0	0.361340296326	We need to make police departments look like the communities they serve in terms of diversity.
0.0	0.384307961211	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.193442482782	You cannot grant amnesty.
0.0	0.38000672261	And, of course, I met the mothers of Eric Garner and Tamir Rice, and Michael Brown and Trayvon Martin and so many of them who have lost their children.
0.0	0.305933211367	Not just the hacking of OPM, but that is -- that is just shameful.
0.0	0.103697236604	And if I were the prosecutor, that is exactly where they would be.
0.0	0.0869059478512	All right.
0.0	0.364675683896	What we have to start thinking about, as leaders, particularly in government, is what can we do for the average American?
0.0	0.290340229622	And that's what I'll offer to the people of the United States in this candidacy for the presidency.
0.0	0.396855884774	Now, you can say that's a tax on the middle class.
0.0	0.235765973827	But states need to do more as well.
0.0	0.143103440112	I do not think it would come to that.
0.0	0.0604643147203	We get Bergdahl.
0.0	0.169733432618	But I'm not giving up on Libya and I don't think anybody should.
0.0	0.0430364348561	It's not great again.
0.0	0.085920970374	Yes.
0.0	0.188207453388	Here's the deal, Chris is totally right.
0.0	0.43444326507	Drug use is about equal between white and black, but our prisons -- three out of four people in prison are black or brown.
0.0	0.27965757081	We need to be focusing on what fixes this country.
0.0	0.218971046454	But let me say one more thing.
0.0	0.312258221092	... having said that, I don't think I'm going to get a whole lot of campaign contributions from Wall Street.
0.0	0.122767326723	He was the only Republican that didn't show up for it.
0.0	0.483862572856	Now in terms of their really stunning hit piece, what they mentioned is when I was running for senate -- unlike Hillary Clinton, I don't have masses of money in the bank, hundreds of millions of dollars.
0.0	0.0978324605469	Afghanistan is a mess.
0.0	0.359728483338	But here's the best way that we're going to make America much more exceptional: it is to make sure we put someone on that stage in September who will fight Hillary Clinton and make sure she never, ever gets in the White House again.
0.0	0.286054533884	Karen and I have seven children.
0.0	0.396173070561	In fact, it's the chief argument by democrats against many of the different flat tax proposals.
0.0	0.0893296385443	I feel like...
0.0	0.299489387605	...you wrote a story on it, and you had to go back and correct it.
0.0	0.177226487126	Got to be on the floor of the Senate.
0.0	0.20540545934	I've done an amazing job.
0.0	0.229855580216	I am a 2nd amendment person.
0.0	0.518449144179	As a governor we actually made the greater investments so that we could go four years in a row without a penny's increase to college tuition.
0.0	0.208195822579	But in 2015, we have a very different economy.
0.0	0.428464603947	Here at home, we've got to do a better job coordinating between federal, state, and local law enforcement.
0.0	0.422304967625	I'm saying, absolutely, we don't have to continue to lose 505 billion dollars as a trade deficit for the privilege of dealing with China.
0.0	0.321687832143	In our own city, I mentioned before, we had become the most addicted city in America.
0.0	0.380870935418	And every law enforcement should carry the antidote to overdose, Naloxone, so that they can save lives that are on the brink of expiring.
0.0	0.100283301443	They do it to us, we don't it.
0.0	0.399562208912	And we have to do more to prevent the flood of foreign fighters that have gone to Syria, especially the ones with western passports, that come back.
0.0	0.305576587729	And I also have detailed plans to fix the mess in Washington, D.C.
1.0	0.98139173114	And what that's led to over $2 trillion of American companies' monies that are being kept offshore, because they don't want to pay the second tax.
0.0	0.298508369761	I think issues and substance, policy and vision and record should be the meat of politics.
0.0	0.0737924866025	That's what really matters.
0.0	0.0591141032625	I will do that in Washington.
0.0	0.393556540074	We have a corrupt campaign finance system dominated by Super PACs.
0.0	0.308058317436	It will cause the economy to grow, to explode, to create more jobs.
0.0	0.348539924749	Iran sanctions -- the Iran sanctions that brought them to the table, those are sanctions that we put in place when I was in the United States Senate, and a whole host of other things that put me in a position of saying, I not only have a great vision, but I can govern effectively in Washington.
0.0	0.354188965094	And together we make it possible for a new generation of young people to refinance their debt and not come out with debt in the future.
0.0	0.355693320499	But as Bill said earlier, Roe v. Wade, it's has been the law for 42 years, and I don't think we should continue to try to change it.
0.0	0.103974475255	This is a war for the soul of Islam.
0.0	0.238428036445	They hit us with a cyberattack simultaneously and dirty bombs.
0.0	0.0886838651709	I was sick and tired of Hillary Clinton's e-mail.
0.0	0.331044522534	Every time he's got a chance, going all the way back to -- remember that Great Beer Summit he had after he messed up that time.
0.0	0.15196762321	Do we still have standards?
0.0	0.147397330236	John, may I -- may I interject here?
0.0	0.106521418464	I'm going to be independent.
0.0	0.0534973198596	I have worked for his re-election.
0.0	0.207420930795	In fact, he's done worse than nothing.
0.0	0.485817548979	And what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice.
0.0	0.310693422192	We would still have racism holding people back.
0.0	0.241471888811	I actually have a plan.
0.0	0.416446132053	The biggest tax increase happened under the watch of Barack Obama, and spending's gone up.
0.0	0.0704347845628	That's for sure.
0.0	0.29059470483	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.304971149231	They said they'd shrink and balance the budget.
0.0	0.437484200696	Since, you know, the end of the last Clinton administration when incomes did go up for everybody.
0.0	0.313018157448	Our next president, and our Republican nominee can not be someone who supports those positions.
0.0	0.282562239229	Well, first off, what we don't do is do what Hillary Clinton and John Kerry and Barack Obama want us to do, which is their solution for everything, put more taxes on it, give more money to Washington, D.C., and then they will fix it.
0.0	0.125903870146	I think something has to change.
0.0	0.465076862683	We are spending $80 billion a year locking up our fellow Americans.
0.0	0.213144157696	I don't think a halt is necessary.
1.0	0.951142234572	Well, Marco has been floating this attack for a few weeks now, but the problem is, the business flat tax in my proposal is not a vat.
0.0	0.302652215714	Atlantic City has gone bad.
0.0	0.105436972728	I know how hard that is.
0.0	0.382772260222	We used to have 16 workers for one retiree, now you have three workers for one retiree.
0.0	0.345637116905	Well, John, I come from the '60s, a long time ago.
0.0	0.339075409354	And if we capture any of them alive, they are getting a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know.
0.0	0.156018692775	They would -- they would accept the responsibilities of full U.S. citizenship.
0.0	0.374543075352	It's saved a lot of lives along the way, Senator.
0.0	0.0595710654997	That's good.
0.0	0.200603761448	And our adversaries continue to grow stronger.
0.0	0.278063174333	During the Cold War -- during the Cold War, we got into a bad habit of always looking to see who was wearing the jersey of the communists, and who was wearing the U.S. jersey.
0.0	0.0698156192594	Believe me.
0.0	0.0271210204087	He's not a leader.
0.0	0.172387851832	It was an investment bank.
0.0	0.655890543212	No.
0.0	0.513621349836	And not only did I win, but I then worked with a Democratic legislature to put in place the most sweeping conservative reforms of any state in America, taking us from the most dangerous state in America to the fourth safest; reducing our welfare rolls by over 1 million, and replacing over 700,000 private sector jobs.
0.0	0.0237253214909	Neil...
0.0	0.334392796586	We're one of the fastest growing states in the country.
1.0	0.97989158082	You used to support legalizing people that were here illegally, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.328762432624	Sure, because there has been three different investigations and proven that I knew nothing.
0.0	0.131898568018	That is the thing that obviously makes sense, we can do that.
0.0	0.339150052352	As a nation, we have to embrace this moment and make our departments more open, more transparent, and more accountable.
0.0	0.350068313483	And my effort in introducing them was to find a solution that reflected common ground and that fixed the problem.
0.0	0.243033196483	Take a look at the deal he's making with Iran.
0.0	0.272387072038	Oh yeah, we want to elect a good president, but America is great from the bottom-up, and the bottom-up is us in our families, in our communities, in our neighborhoods.
1.0	0.981666123399	If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world -- and we double tax, as you know.
0.0	0.0229007910252	Reestablish Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.350998937268	Because what she will do is come in and she will raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.266472307167	I want to speak to all of those maddened by political correctness, where Hillary Clinton apologizes for saying all lives matter.
0.0	0.0239128546319	We have to be honest about it.
0.0	0.655890543212	What do we do?
0.0	0.203842111732	... stirs up the demagoguery against American Muslims, that hurts us at home.
0.0	0.129866656277	Believe me, folks.
0.0	0.304318802696	I never said that Ms. Davis should either lose her job or that she had to do it.
1.0	0.405057299714	However, what Alan Krueger said in the piece you're referring to is that if we went to $15, there are no international comparisons.
0.0	0.366293426784	We need the lawyers(ph) off the back of the war fighters.
0.0	0.087890308759	Credibility counts.
0.0	0.191189183125	Well, it's an interesting question because I'm very proud of my company.
0.0	0.212624877039	They will be our early warning signal.
0.0	0.315415948407	Save Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security without cuts.
1.0	0.979114713917	Secondly, I think it's important to point out that about 3 percent of my donations come from people in the finance and investment world.
0.0	0.508552265496	In the first day in office, my first executive order, I revoked every one of the executive orders that he had -- he had enacted over the prior 12 years.
0.0	0.208597192586	Yes, we must protect our borders.
0.0	0.327490539894	And I'm not standing here today and saying that Libya is as far along as Tunisia.
0.0	0.655890543212	No.
0.0	0.411997754057	We can reform those entitlements, we can change that corporate tax code and lower it.
0.0	0.0745453942142	But you know what?
0.0	0.0999556206246	Well, thank you, John.
0.0	0.259312525915	What happened with Atlantic City is very, very disgraceful.
0.0	0.156743653515	Our differences are fairly deep on this issue.
0.0	0.319542175807	And maybe the back door is the wrong door, and I understand what Apple and others are saying about that.
0.0	0.22550064828	My dad was a small businessman, a really small business.
0.0	0.0902366941355	Becky --
0.0	0.322958299855	And it's a tax you find in many companies in Europe.
0.0	0.344541994108	My tax plan enables you to fill out your taxes on a postcard so we can abolish the IRS.
0.0	0.26501788008	You just don't make promises like this.
0.0	0.34398806175	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government to be setting minimum wages...
0.0	0.105092245136	He got lucky with fracking.
0.0	0.149422102429	Let me say on that...
0.0	0.276176977922	So, we do need to take on the Republicans very clearly and directly.
0.0	0.215011813806	I will work my heart out.
0.0	0.226086181927	We need to tell folks who want to come here, they need to come here legally.
0.0	0.357832642356	Because this president has consistently underestimated the threat of ISIS.
0.0	0.417739833593	When millions of Americans rose up against Obamacare, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.0948123817438	I like that.
0.0	0.354912940138	First priority, destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.158967706682	It's a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.0934323980145	... issues they have to respond to.
0.0	0.398304624523	And in my view, what we need to do is put together broad coalitions to understand that we're not going to have a political vacuum filled by terrorists, that, in fact, we are going to move steadily -- and maybe slowly -- toward democratic societies, in terms of Assad, a terrible dictator.
0.0	0.298118841642	Well, you need somebody, because politicians are all talk, no action.
0.0	0.340539919167	We can end welfare for those here illegally.
0.0	0.213190269389	Yes, our allies are not perfect.
0.0	0.0848029509654	I looked at the evidence.
0.0	0.37704517359	Well, I've been talking to a lot of these families, and this is such an outrage, both because it's bad for our economy, we're a 70 percent consumption economy, people need to feel optimistic and confident, they need to believe their hard work is going to be rewarded, and it's bad for our democracy.
0.0	0.236710342741	And they're looking around them, and they're looking at Washington, and they're saying the rich are getting much richer, I'm getting poorer, what are you going to do about it?
0.0	0.35728184615	And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, because I've been a leader on these issues.
0.0	0.156908511605	My background is different.
0.0	0.0943003415169	He's an S corporation.

0.0	0.221046902326	It was a back sacrifice, and I have to hand it to Ben.

0.0	0.317977074668	You know, we have a war on virtual everything -- race wars, gender wars, income wars, religious wars, age wars.
0.0	0.303656037877	Historically, it is important to try to understand your adversary in order to figure out how they are thinking, what they will be doing, how they will react.
0.0	0.263216102394	No, not a comic book, and it's not a very nicely asked question the way you say that.
0.0	0.085920970374	Yes.
0.0	0.221001865208	And they wanted to make sure it got built.

0.0	0.359212243361	And just to finish, people say, how will you get Mexico to pay?
0.0	0.229923142169	You lead and you produce results.
0.0	0.321035724646	This country is running out of time.
0.0	0.461225135769	Yeah, we can create 13 million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure at a cost of a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.353925098445	We got into a bad habit of creating big bureaucracies, old methodologies, to undermine regimes that were not friendly to the United States.
0.0	0.250487404723	Work requirements and time limits.
0.0	0.333461968114	I learned so much just sitting at his feet playing with blocks listening to him negotiate with subcontractors.
0.0	0.359755424067	It's really a question for all of us to answer, every single one of our children deserves the chance to live up to his or her god-given potential.
0.0	0.361588199002	It should follow the principles of expanding competition, empowering patients, and keeping government from getting in between us and our doctors.
0.0	0.391802188652	What we need to do is take the rest of the federal entitlements, not just welfare, but food stamps and Medicaid and housing programs and do the same thing we did with welfare.
0.0	0.308640303388	We don't need to add new rules, we need to make sure the FBI does its job.
0.0	0.292324712013	It's absolutely the case that if people feel that the game is rigged, that has consequences.
0.0	0.263971087926	He doesn't want to get people together, the old-fashioned way, where you get Congress.

0.0	0.224584547308	Let's talk about something that happened this week in the news.
0.0	0.263607862752	They come up to my office.
0.0	0.22508317416	We are borrowing money from China today.
0.0	0.208456278086	Well, that's easy to answer.
0.0	0.345001286124	... Mr. Trump believed that in reaction to people's fears that we should ban all Muslims.
0.0	0.450259090524	More and more military personnel are leaving becoming veterans, and the waiting list grows.
0.0	0.370072059028	The president has done an executive order with respect to illegal immigration that is illegal.
0.0	0.371068100266	A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to go on a congressional delegation.
0.0	0.311527485402	I -- I think -- I think as Democrats we ought to proudly support the Affordable Care Act, improve it, and make it the model that we know it can be.
0.0	0.340086531494	I'm particularly keen on creating jobs in small business.
0.0	0.196531384331	And what I'm talking about is not only the covert CIA intelligence, I'm also talking about diplomatic intelligence.
0.0	0.0404945949717	Thank you, John.
0.0	0.285042466762	It's not for them to make those decisions about whether or not something is legal or illegal, or profiling or not.
0.0	0.316567901875	And I recognize -- I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa.

0.0	0.0389188456554	He was a great negotiator.
0.0	0.399156687919	And I was proud to get the endorsement of Mayor Walsh of Boston, who has made his struggle with alcoholism a real clarion call for action in this arena.
0.0	0.0185296495541	It's Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.217757002312	I'm going to keep making sure that everything I've done, everything that I stand for is going to be well known.
0.0	0.193747108067	That's how you make peace in the world.
0.0	0.378592016122	And the way we've done it properly through regulatory action, not buy signing unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.435014855041	What we have to do right now is bring our people together and understand that we must provide a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people.

0.0	0.0668180764714	I'm prepared.
0.0	0.339789764521	And here's an area where Secretary Clinton and I believe we have a difference.
0.0	0.255227380241	And you should hope that our next president is someone that is influence by their faith.
0.0	0.257322913971	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.0461553910854	We need a doer, not a talker.
0.0	0.158300116556	And let me be clear.
0.0	0.437228479252	You know, when you go into the store and buy a box of laundry detergent, and the price has up -- you know, 50 cents because of regulations, a poor person notices that.
0.0	0.297612889164	And Mexico's going to pay for the wall because Mexico -- I love the Mexican people; I respect the Mexican leaders -- but the leaders are much sharper, smarter and more cunning than our leaders.
0.0	0.0626065390377	I hate to hear it."
0.0	0.283895315106	We have a huge mental health problem in this country.
0.0	0.296548333469	In my view, it doesn't go anywhere near far enough.
0.0	0.655890543212	So did you.
0.0	0.39717826822	So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States.
0.0	0.14096813912	Why don't you wait in line?
0.0	0.120948911101	No criminal records for them.
0.0	0.246901037189	They are devaluing -- it's so impossible for -- you look at Caterpillar Tractor and what's happening with Caterpillar and Kamatsu (ph).
0.0	0.0745453942142	And how do I know it?
1.0	0.99999157893	Median wages have stagnated.
0.0	0.286315965449	I want to make sure the wealthy pay their fair share, which they have not been doing.

0.0	0.331117137113	If you get caught abusing this program, you should never be able to use it again.
0.0	0.0824151779244	I'm going to do it for America.
0.0	0.393774949756	And we also need to make sure that the really discriminatory messages that Trump is sending around the world don't fall on receptive ears.
0.0	0.237313421772	Without China, North Korea doesn't even eat.
0.0	0.114609013351	Here is the bottom line.
0.0	0.655890543212	But what...
0.0	0.309764959469	We need to pass a Medicare for all single payer system.
0.0	0.0526281599741	Check it out.
0.0	0.242727287528	With a couple of additional tweaks, we know what this will do.
0.0	0.394945914229	That's the book where you changed your position on immigration because you used to support a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.455859688854	What I believe is the United States, in fact, should join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee healthcare to all people.
0.0	0.0185716613881	Here's the story.
0.0	0.353715729435	There is no reason why you can't stand for principles, go and fight for them and be able also, to have to get things done in government.
0.0	0.444273277845	It will provide three months paid family and medical leave for the working families of this country.
0.0	0.216534729693	First of all, let's have some rules here, commentators.
0.0	0.182127406461	So it was not against ISIS, it was against -- it was against Assad.
0.0	0.321736330865	You know, what people are frustrated about in Washington, D.C.., and I know the folks out there tonight are incredibly frustrated because what they see is a government that doesn't work for them.
0.0	0.0658350854165	I'll take that, too.
0.0	0.376076587785	I think now what I've called for is counsel for every child so that no child has to face any kind of process without someone who speaks and advocates for that child so that the right decision hopefully can be made.
0.0	0.655890543212	You did.
0.0	0.154131275296	I know the Democrats have the ultimate SuperPac.
0.0	0.517210175734	I would just say, I debated then Senator Obama numerous times on stages like this, and he was the recipient of the largest number of Wall Street donations of anybody running on the Democratic side ever.
0.0	0.240138039895	To talk about we're just gonna have a 10 percent tithe and that's how we're gonna fund the government?
0.0	0.201108873804	You know, Hillary Clinton's always saying how Republicans don't follow science?
0.0	0.339703363042	We did it, and it worked, and nobody headed for the hills or left the state because of it.
0.0	0.0745453942142	But you know what?
0.0	0.432112611684	But also the biggest people (ph) -- now I've used that to my advantage as a business man, for my family, for myself.
0.0	0.00823591902033	Maria...
0.0	0.327523761635	Maria, you look at what this president and his secretary of state, Secretary of State Clinton, has done to get us in this spot.
0.0	0.210796860024	You learn to constantly evaluate and understand the nature of the threats that you are being faced with.
0.0	0.411617303898	Absolutely, because what we will do is say, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so they're not hanging out on street corners.
0.0	0.24606345867	There was a lot of activism on campus -- Civil Rights activism, antiwar activism, women's rights activism -- and I do appreciate the way young people are standing up and speaking out.
0.0	0.263548460223	They can provide forces.
0.0	0.193133799325	And I have many great Muslim friends.
0.0	0.0226720661381	Yeah.
0.0	0.0380601278989	And what is that proposal?
0.0	0.239211993746	But after I said that, we're not hearing so much about Hillary Clinton's e-mails.
0.0	0.221383436057	And we have to lead, if we're going to be successful.
0.0	0.266117272811	But I know that we offered a lot of help and I know it was difficult for the Libyans to accept help.
0.0	0.392903217264	Islamic terrorism is eating up large portions of the Middle East.
0.0	0.262008935673	Whenever they have problems, we send over the ships.
0.0	0.131559117054	And it only makes common sense.
0.0	0.275079495903	Our identity is not based on race or ethnicity, it's based on a set of shared values.
0.0	0.655890543212	That is what we have to do.
1.0	0.522881378373	And I have assets -- big accounting firm, one of the most highly respected -- 9 billion 240 million dollars.
0.0	0.306403861357	You know, I have said -- I have said many times, you know, I'm not asking people to support me because I'm a woman.
0.0	0.0615369280334	Yeah, they are unhinged.
0.0	0.33317511964	And, we have a government and leaders in government that are completely out of touch, and that's why I'm running for president.
0.0	0.181916456484	But you know, here's the real issue, is this America anymore?
0.0	0.0585367215739	It's not only a problem here.
0.0	0.317966414727	Number two, we're going to enforce our immigration laws.
0.0	0.110857533698	... hillaryclinton.com, and read about it.
0.0	0.169325671512	I think that's a major accomplishment.
0.0	0.459563168104	In a previous Democratic debate, Martha Raddatz, three times, asked Hillary Clinton about the failure in Libya, a policy that she took credit for, and said, "what is your measure of responsibility, Madam Secretary, for the failure in Libya?"
0.0	0.10400642591	They do celebrate more dependence on the government.
0.0	0.237886915877	But on this point, if I may add something on this point.
0.0	0.131687761669	They sweated like dogs.
0.0	0.0402701853988	OK?
0.0	0.20705140831	But also, I can't fake anger.
0.0	0.435641308118	But there wasn't a single day as mayor of Baltimore that I wasn't asked whether I was delivering on the promise I made to police the police.
0.0	0.229283064865	I don't need anybody's money.
0.0	0.159686947668	Look, what we need on this issue is not more polls.
0.0	0.223875963869	Thirdly, what I have a really problem, and as you mentioned - this is a problem, I recognize it as a problem.
0.0	0.313553851667	Well, this goes to the question you were just asking.
0.0	0.36013354543	We're giving young people and working people hope that real change can take place in America.
0.0	0.265980735256	It's going to happen in this country, there are going to be further attacks.
0.0	0.412886869305	Much of the discussion is centered over whether or not the different tax plans help, or affect the middle class.
0.0	0.0450550623576	Why weren't they vigilant?
0.0	0.222854636692	Neil, Neil -- can I say one thing about this.
0.0	0.385497744209	But I think this is a worldwide -- that the entire world needs to come together to deal with this horrific refugee crisis we're seeing from Syria and Afghanistan, as well.
0.0	0.110095799373	I'm not fighting that.
0.0	0.240619499833	Exactly what to do as it relates to ISIS.
0.0	0.0418296002379	They are refusing to...
0.0	0.315585434983	I did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild.
0.0	0.308260572332	I'm the only person on this stage who's done that and we will get it done as President of the United States.
0.0	0.12945328775	She said the truth.
0.0	0.370393745249	The rest of the world is moving away from us towards other alliances because we are weak.
0.0	0.379023653724	We need a leader that can bring back our jobs, can bring back our manufacturing, can bring back our military, can take care of our vets.
0.0	0.390188713107	And if we do not get our act together and listen to what the scientists say, you're going to see countries all over the world -- this is what the CIA says -- they're going to be struggling over limited amounts of water, limited amounts of land to grow their crops ask you're going to see all kinds of international conflict.
0.0	0.0714707987684	Ninety-three hours.
0.0	0.350696465583	I believe we should focus on middle-class families, working families, and poor kids who have the ambition and the talent to go to college and get ahead.
0.0	0.293373128451	The fact of the matter is we the American people are not each other's enemies, it's those people who are trying to divide us who are the enemies.
0.0	0.0961558039055	What -- what -- you're from New York?
0.0	0.263923510862	... no, you already had your chance, Marco, and you blew it.
0.0	0.32836879207	So what we do, though, is, if there is somebody who is price- gouging, we have laws for prosecutors to take that on.
0.0	0.260327522703	That's the record of accomplishment that should be taken to Hillary Clinton, who has no record of accomplishment.
0.0	0.174365447996	Let me just -- let me just...
0.0	0.282356867626	Like, I'm standing here, I -- I watched the video of Senator Cruz.
0.0	0.149805003329	When I'm president, we're going to have a president that acts like it.
0.0	0.291796545901	And this big powerful, corrupt bureaucracy works now only for the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected.
0.0	0.424383860425	The only way we're are going to be able to move forward after two migratory crises with minor, after two unconstitutional executive orders, the only way forward on this issue is to first bring illegal immigration under control.
0.0	0.3305255515	And we didn't put a single boot on the ground, and Gaddafi was deposed.
0.0	0.241785964455	No, they don't like he beats the rest of the field, because they want me.
0.0	0.303429120997	From my perspective, we have to prevent the Republicans from rolling back the progress that we've made.
0.0	0.0768946265917	And this is not an endeavor that rewards that.
0.0	0.0218776589379	On welfare.
0.0	0.393601711321	I think that there are many other reasons why it has in addition to what happened in the region, but I don't think that the United States has the bulk of the responsibility.
0.0	0.246408343221	He's a left-wing judicial activist, Harvard Law professor who was Al Gore's lawyer in Bush versus Gore.
0.0	0.309228725882	And -- you know, all of this too big to fail stuff and picking and choosing winners and losers -- this is a bunch of crap, and it is really causing a great deal of -- great deal of problems for our society right now.
0.0	0.246095293346	The question was, would you meet with an adversary without conditions?
0.0	0.0949829392711	...the only reason is -- look...
0.0	0.0918806176349	She's an American citizen.
0.0	0.367882018647	I would not place one American life at risk unless it was absolutely necessary.
0.0	0.100825131907	We will be there soon.
0.0	0.372137450567	So I'm going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of Americans fulfilling their potential, because I don't think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single American to live up to theirs.
0.0	0.314750250678	Is there going to be any change in the House with new leadership?
0.0	0.402432159569	What my campaign is about is a political revolution -- millions of people standing up and saying, enough is enough.
0.0	0.321790793315	I -- I believe that we should make community college free.
0.0	0.489309059727	Today, we are on pace to have the smallest Army since the end of World War II, the smallest Navy in 100 years, the smallest Air Force in our history.
0.0	0.12063855018	And, folks, we will.
0.0	0.339687251919	Number one...
0.0	0.406423435567	And then, with the revolution against Assad -- and I did early on say we needed to try to find a way to train and equip moderates very early so that we would have a better idea of how to deal with Assad because I thought there would be extremist groups filling the vacuum.
0.0	0.376996790282	You know, the American president has to both keep our families safe and make the economy grow in a way that helps everyone, not just those at the top.
0.0	0.38958176998	And, I'll note finally, Chris, there is a reason that Iowa's Congressman Steve King, perhaps the fiercest defender of farmers in this state, is sharing my campaign.
0.0	0.341199568284	In Houston, Texas, there's an organization in place because someone acted on their heart, wanted to make sure that there's no homeless veterans in Houston.
0.0	0.368164727811	You know, I've supported legislation to allow body cameras.
0.0	0.250225650274	I know that; I've been dealing with them for a long time.
0.0	0.516394228755	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.247057571626	And let's not let the secular progressives drive that out of us.
0.0	0.164739689795	And I'm delighted to be here in New Hampshire for this debate.
0.0	0.437968860979	And that is why I am pledged, if elected president of the United States, to bring about a political revolution where millions of people begin to stand up and finally say enough is enough, this great country and our government belong to all of us, not just a handful of billionaires.
0.0	0.494192699517	We have to put the personnel on that border in the right places; you have to put the strategic fencing in place; and you have to have aviation assets that fly all the way from Tijuana to El Paso to Brownsville, Texas -- 1,933 miles looking down 24/7, with the technology to be able to identify what individuals are doing, and ID when they are in obviously illegal activities or suspicious activities, and quick response teams come.
0.0	0.17314046704	And we can no longer continue to sweep it under the rug.
0.0	0.338606202643	We will invest in education, and jobs for our kids, not incarceration and more jails.
0.0	0.312662002838	Roads, bridges, water systems, wastewater plants, who denies that?
0.0	0.210178857478	I have said the invasion of Iraq was a mistake.
0.0	0.43893676796	We have to support the fighters on the ground, principally the Arabs and the Kurds who are willing to stand up and take territory back from Raqqa to Ramadi.
0.0	0.238781287493	Leading by fixing the things that are broken.
0.0	0.244403016416	This actually is America's fight.
0.0	0.147871743896	He said, "I can't get it into China.
0.0	0.00430451372677	Thank you.
0.0	0.343448151366	The American people have been told for 30 years they're going to enforce the border, they're going to build a wall and it never gets built and it never happens.
0.0	0.0399348799123	They're off to China.
0.0	0.0233384825485	And I'm glad I did it.
0.0	0.172403710593	Nobody can deny them.
0.0	0.157054629851	You know what he said to me?
0.0	0.0253326231818	Here's the truth.
0.0	0.314207876065	But we can give people better health care.
0.0	0.0852767049994	It's coming from more than Mexico.
0.0	0.178348385473	Maria, Neil, thank you for a great debate tonight.
0.0	0.234193528602	And the idea that this negotiation -- I will tell you one thing.
0.0	0.306659360987	Well, this is one of the reasons why Tom Perkins and I had disagreements in the boardroom, Becky.
0.0	0.411909169957	Mine is unique in the sense that my tax plan actually gets rid of the payroll tax as well.
0.0	0.175254194047	Yes, exactly, exactly.
0.0	0.0905857726739	I don't think it's gonna happen.
0.0	0.149676784385	I do think that it's important to defend it.
0.0	0.098303642662	I'm going to tell you -- thank you.
0.0	0.128602441103	We can't even go there.
0.0	0.20059303967	I strongly support the president's executive actions.
0.0	0.34683311083	Their kids come out of college, they have high debt and they can't get a good job.
0.0	0.248453016874	We have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone.
0.0	0.439576866862	But I will tell you this, Atlantic City, you're using that, hundreds of companies that I have opened have thrived.
1.0	0.47367317542	In fact, wages adjusted for inflation haven't risen since the turn of the last century, after my husband's administration.
0.0	0.0354539283296	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.489362632302	When I was running for senate just about every lobbyist, just about all of the establishment opposed me in the senate race in Texas and my opponent in that race was worth over 200 million dollars.
0.0	0.0635359695305	They're not good.
0.0	0.163230838245	The other issue is mental health.
0.0	0.435172965659	Now that applies universally to giant corporations that with lobbyists right now are not paying taxes, and as small business.
0.0	0.410941029514	Now 16 percent is what the rate Ted wants it at.
0.0	0.427453716149	So let's start by knowing where your money is being spent by the federal government.
0.0	0.175935525184	And for the sake of me, I can't figure out which one is which.
0.0	0.0908342452235	Good at email.
0.0	0.104630792122	It should always be going up.
0.0	0.22156116048	I think they're more interested in what we have to say about all the big issues facing us.
0.0	0.237634298932	We're going to be tough at the border, we're going to be tough on all of the illegal immigrants that everybody else in this field -- we're going to be different.
0.0	0.349223403441	So if we're going to be talking like this, we can -- and maybe we can score some political points -- but the fact is: Every one of us stands for the kind of economy that will work better for every American.
0.0	0.460379416119	Whether it's welfare reform and getting something back for the hard-earned taxpayers; whether it's engaging in Pentagon reform and taking on the big contractors that were charging thousands of dollars for hammers and screw drivers and ripping us off; or whether it's taking on the special interests in the nursing home industry in Ohio, so that mom and dad can have the ability to stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.
0.0	0.330436581688	And I think once I'm in the White House we will have enough political capital to be able to do that.
0.0	0.333880546889	Let's let a Justice Department -- and I will make an attorney general who will enforce the law and make justice more than just a word.
0.0	0.347672681109	We need major, major reforms of a very broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.0139275739624	It's not crass.
0.0	0.1729135789	I'd like to jump in.
0.0	0.209863113159	... Actually, I was...
0.0	0.33878948076	The terrible, authoritarian, Communist dictatorship he warned us about, now he's urging companies to shut down and move to China.
0.0	0.146286141981	Yes, I'm going to do away with that.
0.0	0.446079735962	Real inflation accounted for wages has declined precipitously over the years.
0.0	0.235985275698	We are in a war against ISIS.
0.0	0.288803538212	We would still have LGBT people who get married on Saturday and get fired on Monday.
0.0	0.311710814467	Guaranteeing that women's work finally gets the pay, the equal pay that we deserve.
0.0	0.239709918915	We have a stock market that is so bloated.
0.0	0.235321470091	I can tell you, there wouldn't have been much damage.
0.0	0.434730297567	The United States, at the same time, cannot successfully fight Assad and ISIS.
0.0	0.322686332535	But Iran is at the heart of most of the evil that is going on in the Middle East through their proxies.
0.0	0.242325861094	I'm meeting with three of them in the next week.
0.0	0.110409771426	That makes no sense to everybody.
0.0	0.119113099367	We don't need anything.
0.0	0.159532525577	We don't need more of the same solutions.
0.0	0.337828982374	And until we deal with the health of Americans and do what we did with polio -- when I was a little kid, we eradicated it.
0.0	0.32769546119	They're building up their military to a point that is very scary.
0.0	0.0937322607697	Say again?
0.0	0.188349448909	They;re gone.
0.0	0.412511970008	What a president of the United States has got to do -- and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility -- is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe, that we work with allies around the world to protect...
1.0	0.263401984843	That's long-term debt, very low interest rates.
0.0	0.260501672334	And I think this has become something that needs to be looked at in terms of regulation.
0.0	0.34146056234	I have voted not to give gun makers and sellers immunity.
0.0	0.122587587316	I was there and I saw the debate.
0.0	0.444263644041	And it requires an entire world to come together, including in a very active way, the Muslim nations.
0.0	0.0583332218899	I'm getting to that.
0.0	0.0850114441971	Don't believe it.
0.0	0.0357860130024	Talk about what?
0.0	0.399805337573	I think THAT you can talk about Islamists who clearly are also jihadists, but I think it's not particularly helpful to make the case that Senator Sanders was just making that I agree with, that we've got to reach out to Muslim countries.
0.0	0.213375795059	He's a good guy, a smart guy, and he would be a heck of a lot better president than Hillary Rodham Clinton would ever be.
0.0	0.156712928573	It works very, very well.
0.0	0.45851998592	I advocated arming the moderate opposition back in the day when I was still secretary of State, because I worried we would end up exactly where we are now.
0.0	0.139651277855	This is beyond anybody's expectations.
0.0	0.23630775372	And I will always allow my faith to influence everything I do.
0.0	0.127719497528	I'm president -- look, I've done it once.
0.0	0.345861972761	We're reducing taxes to 15 percent.
0.0	0.455905353024	And that means when police officers out in a community do illegal activity -- kill people who are unarmed who should not be killed, they must be held accountable.
0.0	0.0939444310289	We're running.
0.0	0.655890543212	How do we do it?"
0.0	0.455995945	So, let's not in anyway imply here that either President Obama or myself, would in anyway not take on any vested interested, whether it's Wall Street, or drug companies, or insurance companies, or frankly, the gun lobby to stand up to do what's best for the American people.
0.0	0.0339944867252	They are not perfect.
0.0	0.380946820072	Here's -- apart from the -- apart from the higher prices on consumers and people are living paycheck to paycheck, apart from that, there will be retaliation.
0.0	0.31268116613	And that free education of extraordinary accomplishment was from first grade to 12th grade.
0.0	0.0178641164249	No vision at all.
0.0	0.0784726226061	I used the tithing analogy.
1.0	0.401714600217	We get a no-good traitor, and they get the five people that they wanted for years, and those people are now back on the battlefield trying to kill us.
0.0	0.119122055606	And I'll tell you what I'm worried about -- I'm worried about money.
0.0	0.212281344849	So I believe as president I will look very carefully about unintended consequences.
0.0	0.280716833861	They're making a half, two-thirds what they used to make.
1.0	0.941457370326	I have not insulted Donald personally and I don't intend to.
0.0	0.158883924699	That's what I've always stood for.
0.0	0.524995032432	She is disagreeing with FDR on Social Security, LBJ on Medicare and with the vast majority of progressive Democrats in the House and the Senate, who today are fighting to end the disgrace of the United States being the only major country on Earth that doesn't provide paid family and medical leave.
0.0	0.491407907009	We were the only state in American that went four years in a row without a penny increase in college tuition.
0.0	0.341263962111	Both Democrats and Republicans have gotten us in the mess we're in -- $18 trillion of debt, a bad deal with Iran, we're not staying with Israel.
0.0	0.433112994014	I don't know if people understand, but I spent a lifetime with my colleagues getting us to a federal balanced budget.
0.0	0.372145493816	You read about all the companies now that are doing business -- about to do business in Iran, and if we don't get this settled now, with other countries in the world, about sanctions, then Iran could violate that agreement, and we're the only ones putting the sanctions on.
0.0	0.187618469904	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.272286367674	They've been talking about this issue for 30 years, and nothing ever happens.
0.0	0.506262281522	You have six financial institutions today that have assets of 56 percent, equivalent to 56 percent of the GDP In America.
0.0	0.242765559881	The truth is I had to make some tough calls in some tough times.
1.0	0.484374516638	We have the highest rate of childhood poverty, and we're the only country in the world -- virtually the only country that doesn't guarantee paid family and medical leave.
0.0	0.228629038754	I would just...
0.0	0.121105902785	Let's calm down a little bit, Martin.
0.0	0.0169681944462	So be very, very careful.
0.0	0.36625416188	You know, I listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas.
0.0	0.0109382915112	I didn't.
0.0	0.149422102429	Kathie, let me say this.
0.0	0.410587569281	Well, first of all, if a company gets caught doing that, they should never be able to use the program again.
0.0	0.405917629876	You see, all of my career, I've fought about giving voice to the people that I grew up with and voice to the people that elected me.
0.0	0.546612774291	After those four years of looking back and being prepared, the preparation to be the most powerful individual in the world requires an extraordinary amount of work: not just having been the governor of the 12th largest economy in the world, which I might add, we added 1.5 million jobs during that period of time over that 2007 through 2014 period, a period when America was going through the most deep recession it had been through since the Great Depression.
0.0	0.319510702032	It has to be based on what skills you have, what you can contribute economically, and most important of all, on whether or not you're coming here to become an American, not just live in America, but be an American.
0.0	0.208251195039	But let's not -- but let's not -- let's not insult -- let's not insult the intelligence of the American people.
0.0	0.0414536722995	Absolutely.
0.0	0.126990699855	But you know what else they're anxious about?
0.0	0.447761871401	And I was determined to do everything that I could to make VA health care the best in the world, to expand benefits to the men and women who put their lives on the line to defending.
0.0	0.215069958574	So I'm confident if I win this nomination, I will aggressively go against her and beat her.
0.0	0.0332163066976	How stupid are they?
0.0	0.374400362731	If you looking at what happened with Boeing and if you look at what happened with so many companies that deal -- so we don't have an equal playing field.
0.0	0.335887810624	I mean, we had to borrow so much money to send them to college and were not the only ones.
0.0	0.138703546201	Yes, it's very simple.
0.0	0.655890543212	What do we do?
0.0	0.0745453942142	And you know what?
0.0	0.31312560791	My mom who's here today, was a single mom when my father left us when I was 3 years old.
0.0	0.407472055406	I've lived my whole life fighting -- fighting for things that I believe in, fighting for justice and to protect people from crime and terrorism, fighting to stand up for folks who have not had enough and need an opportunity to get more, and to stand up and fight against the special interests.
0.0	0.461442669997	If I could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited.
0.0	0.372281015726	And by the way, the police are the most mistreated people in this country.
0.0	0.150667940553	Those are the hard numbers.
0.0	0.16474423769	She is the best parent and grandmother that I know.
1.0	0.030083566319	It's not theirs anymore.
0.0	0.331522527468	The first vote hasn't been counted.
0.0	0.169845420243	I mean, that's a fact.
0.0	0.365589236766	I think what President Obama did was to exemplify the importance of this issue as our first African American president, and to address it both from the President's office, and through his advocacy, such as working with young men, and Mrs. Obama's work with young women.
0.0	0.100255978344	But here's the best solution of all.
0.0	0.411978760358	And by the way, it's not just on immigration, you used to support TPA, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.147949339612	It will end on January 2017.
0.0	0.0503070755256	I love China.
0.0	0.436430001562	We can put America back on track on a growth level and a growth rate that we've never seen in the history of this country.
0.0	0.22332592573	So, yes, I did know people.
0.0	0.355438419576	And listen, there are many, many wonderful, wonderful working men and women in the state of New York.
0.0	0.395418575835	And nobody watching at home believed that any of the moderators had any intention of voting in a Republican primary.
0.0	0.655890543212	But Megyn...
0.0	0.0869059478512	That's not right.
0.0	0.258001022851	That's the kind of coalition we need and that's the kind of coalition I will put together.
0.0	0.0784354889042	That is absolutely inaccurate.
0.0	0.357290314038	There's a reason Gun Owners of America has endorsed me in this race.
0.0	0.198413428584	I've prosecuted terrorists.
0.0	0.0395185267103	That's who's in my mind
0.0	0.220311518972	Finally, we'll take off the political handcuffs.
0.0	0.170170216077	I'm not using donors.
0.0	0.230746486277	I think after 11 hours, that's pretty clear, yes.
0.0	0.230513445868	I guess just for the fun of it; they want to throw money around.
0.0	0.311709567268	ISIS is the most dangerous jihadist group in the history of mankind.
0.0	0.13235475297	I hope those are the issues we'll discuss.
1.0	0.176130251054	I never filed for bankruptcy.
0.0	0.0907906782089	Because it wouldn't work.
0.0	0.370321778694	This isn't just the country I was born in, this is the nation that literally changed the history of my family.
0.0	0.227052155824	It cannot be contained, it must be defeated.
0.0	0.116384602081	There are no simple solutions.
0.0	0.434361275082	And that's the reason that I've said under my presidency, we'll create jobs and make American the number one manufacturing country in the world.
0.0	0.373275846877	And everything is costing more money, and we are killing our -- our -- our people like this.
0.0	0.0322243833281	You once had a pension.
0.0	0.311565760316	And the reason is simple: because in 2008, we elected as president someone who wasn't interested in fixing America.
1.0	0.950331270128	In this case, our staff did the wrong thing -- they looked a that information.
0.0	0.24982770791	He doesn't understand the threat in ISIS.
0.0	0.655890543212	Both.
0.0	0.429915138671	The first speech I gave in this campaign back in April was about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration.
0.0	0.319199412933	I sent a boat over and they actually sent it back.
0.0	0.463453798262	In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense.
0.0	0.235777619829	Can you have Medicare or Social Security?
0.0	0.400660453285	I was the chairman of the National Commission on Homeland Security and Terrorism for the United States for five years.
0.0	0.220369266554	But for that Texas police officer, we could have had a mass murder.
0.0	0.354086282621	Yes, we could get rid of Saddam Hussein, but that destabilized the entire region.
0.0	0.357127376774	I had to answer every single question about every single result and every single projection in public until there were no more questions.
0.0	0.0487816769048	... What was your question...
0.0	0.655890543212	So what do we do?
0.0	0.378203206856	There is a bill sitting in the House that would actually pass and have us go to zero-based budgeting so we know where every dime of your money is being spent instead of only talking about how much more we're going to spend year after year after year.
0.0	0.655890543212	We have Dodd-Frank.
0.0	0.0165564763891	He undermines it.
0.0	0.303087988268	They have children who are doing so well, I've met and worked with dreamers.
0.0	0.191754449688	I have a difference of opinion with Secretary Clinton on this.
0.0	0.330212323407	Barack Obama believes that America is a arrogant global power that needs to be cut down to size.
0.0	0.273327275606	We need to move on this consensus that exists in the country.
0.0	0.0704813020143	They didn't do that either.
0.0	0.154667269225	Obama is going to be out playing golf.
1.0	0.328869317585	The bad news is, we have 470,000 going out of business every year.
0.0	0.333293408094	...The only way we're going to be morale, the only way we're going to keep our promise to seniors is start by following the first rule we should all follow, which is to look at them, treat them like adults, and tell them the truth.
0.0	0.447563587059	Those costs are then added to the overall cost, which does increase the insurance premiums for people in the private system.
0.0	0.241606927138	You've got to go the extra mile.
0.0	0.260497261813	And your point is absolutely well taken.
0.0	0.40506235683	And this is what we have to -- I -- I've got to tell you, when wages don't rise -- and they haven't for a lot of families for a number of years -- it's very, very difficult for them.
0.0	0.230494310467	I will show you what they do to women.
0.0	0.26285547855	You spend the money today and then you hope you're going to save money tomorrow.
0.0	0.182540599508	I said, "I don't know."
0.0	0.447708706295	The statistics from Wisconsin are particularly troubling, because it is the highest rate of incarceration for African-Americans in our nation, twice the national average.
0.0	0.448128038311	And we fought for statewide school choice, where the dollars follow the child, instead of the child following the dollars.
0.0	0.312903954694	And I've had many situations in the state of Ohio where we've had to move, whether it's storms, whether it was a horrible school shooting.
0.0	0.42601590648	Millions of people are going to have to stand up, turn off the TV, get involved in the political process and tell the big- money interest that we are taking back our country.
0.0	0.23206414103	Number one, we're really good.
0.0	0.182166584069	Just ditto to that.
0.0	0.291041117482	And I also want to recognize the people in that church that showed the grace of God and the grace of forgiveness and the mercy that they showed.
0.0	0.0924125498687	I'm the only guy on this stage -- you know, everybody has an "only guy" -- "I'm the only guy this; I'm the only guy that."

0.0	0.117019214994	Neil, the problem...
0.0	0.354992621824	I want to find out -- many people saw pipe bombs and all sorts of things all over their apartment.
0.0	0.300954163483	They're controlled fully -- they're controlled fully by the lobbyists, by the donors, and by the special interests, fully.
1.0	0.283513186734	They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us.
0.0	0.379638052201	I was one -- I was the only -- one of only seven states that had a AAA bond rating.
0.0	0.123194969946	(LAUGHTER) And he got nasty.
0.0	0.221307623155	Oh, well, you know, it just didn't work out for you.
0.0	0.382204461871	What the polls are showing is that we are actually defeating the secretary among younger people.
0.0	0.234968922648	So I think, yeah, regime change is easy, getting rid of dictators is easy.
0.0	0.387159344346	That now includes the internet, because we have seen that ISIS is a very effective recruiter, propagandist and inciter and celebrator of violence.
0.0	0.361781250514	They told you that your Social Security money is in a trust fund.
0.0	0.205217833982	You want to talk about what we're going to be up against next year?
0.0	0.206036900499	You know, frankly, I did it in Washington, in Ohio, and I will do it again in Washington, if I'm president, to get this country moving again.
0.0	0.421620422048	Chris, in 1981, when Ronald Reagan came to the Oval Office, he encountered a military that had been debilitated just as the current military has, just like Jimmy Carter weakened our readiness, undermined our ability to defend this country, so too has Barack Obama.
0.0	0.363104830804	We do have to take a hard look at the defense budget and we do have to figure out how we get ready to fight the adversaries of the future, not the past.
0.0	0.261063066227	The people don't work for us.
0.0	0.409704470468	There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies.
0.0	0.655890543212	We have to do it.
0.0	0.273352984678	My daughters went to college on a mountain of bills.
0.0	0.316989128971	You know, after 9/11, one of the efforts that we did in New York was if you see something or hear something suspicious, report it.
0.0	0.393896938169	Do you think that the Chinese, if they had a 45 percent tariff imposed on all their imports wouldn't retaliate and start buying Airbus?
0.0	0.335557183977	So as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and the like.
0.0	0.0435568386024	And he'll say, "Please, please, please."
0.0	0.085920970374	Yes.
1.0	0.345934534496	But I will -- but I will tell you this, the socialist says they're going to pay for everything and give you everything for free, except they don't say they're going to raise it through taxes to 90 percent to do it.
0.0	0.26935530758	Look, the Second Amendment is not an option.
0.0	0.288921092933	It's also about choosing our next commander-in-chief.
0.0	0.388412713105	We also got rid of their chemical weapons, which was a big help, and we also went after a lot of the shoulder-fired missiles to round them up.
0.0	0.0856175019539	But I learned a lot.
0.0	0.263533459327	And we can do it again together, all of us, to strengthen this country, work together.
0.0	0.249037486721	Well, he appointed Eric Holder as attorney general.
0.0	0.121597686812	Unless you are clinically insane...

0.0	0.359029671363	I have debt-free tuition plans, free community college plans, getting student debt down.
0.0	0.111359678338	It is a tragedy all over this country.
0.0	0.319346302954	Number two, we had a really good plan.
0.0	0.159032407076	We're ready to start shooting."
0.0	0.0414536722995	Absolutely.
0.0	0.406514587665	I mean the fact is, is that they need to put the pressure on and frankly we need to intercepts ships coming out of North Korea so they don't proliferate all these dangerous materials.
0.0	0.00430451372677	Thank you.
0.0	0.19295274754	And I think that's the false choice...
0.0	0.23587908189	The Democrats can't even come up with one.
0.0	0.167918838355	Radical Muslims and radical Islam is not just hate talk.
0.0	0.35556614418	And you look around, and you see what's happening, and this is not the case when he introduced the doctor -- very nice, everything perfect but that is not representative of what you have in that line of migration.
0.0	0.29489855665	For 30 years this country has been baited with that.
0.0	0.0127483360414	John?
0.0	0.30750506976	They understand the vulnerabilities we have on the southern border.
1.0	0.989490983225	We pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.
0.0	0.2820245202	Never support.
0.0	0.265588329405	We are already de-conflicting air space.
0.0	0.261022161221	That's because we've put conservative policies in place.
0.0	0.29709571254	You have no disposable income when you are make 10, 12 bucks an hour.
0.0	0.251807373341	I'd sign that executive order.
0.0	0.0864425894439	You're simply not.
0.0	0.416817926929	Well, Mr. Cooney, we've actually been focusing on border security to the exclusion of talking about comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.427056015355	Not committing crimes and earn legal status where you're not cutting in front of the line for people that are patiently waiting outside.
0.0	0.0745453942142	You know why?
0.0	0.425516888921	I've had the growth code (ph) there for about five years, and it's this specific program.
0.0	0.394507974406	And it is a fact that the net immigration from Mexico and South has basically zeroed out.
0.0	0.34343521263	We need to control the border, we need to do all of this in a comprehensive way, not just going back and forth and talking about stuff --
0.0	0.342613457856	Everytime they got a paycheck, the government reached in and took something out of it before they ever saw it.
0.0	0.178875709805	Marco can change his mind.
0.0	0.447648829558	Well, I'm kind of confused because he was the sponsor of the Gang of Eight bill that did require a bunch of thresholds but ultimately allowed for citizenship over an extended period of time.
0.0	0.222003370531	They get good stories, because the newspapers get buffaloed (ph).
0.0	0.234931814312	Could I just say -- just say this...
0.0	0.307340279263	We could turn off that spigot by charging them tax until they behave properly.
0.0	0.3936743499	But I want to start by helping those people who are most at risk, the ones who, yes, are cutting their pills in half, who don't believe they can make the rent, who are worried about what comes next for them.
0.0	0.0430364348561	How great is that?
0.0	0.486158825899	Number one, we should allow people to purchase health insurance across state lines.
0.0	0.10332461187	It's become more complicated.
0.0	0.442475854873	I believe that countries like Saudi Arabia and Qatar have got to step up to the plate, have got to contribute the money that we need, and the troops that we need, to destroy ISIS with American support.
0.0	0.391494040413	It means that we take marijuana out of the federal law as a crime and give states the freedom to go forward with legalizing marijuana.
0.0	0.240217292296	I disagree with free college for everybody.
1.0	0.966323468492	Nobody knows who Mossadegh was, democratically-elected prime minister of Iran.
0.0	0.340730670088	We don't want to make it seem as though we are turning into a nation of fear instead of a nation of resolve.
0.0	0.317746868462	If you take donations from Wall Street, you can't be independent.
0.0	0.366094964159	But I was able to get Democrats to support the most conservative sweeping policy changes in any state in America.
0.0	0.257744243007	At the time, the liberal governor of Florida, who claimed he was a Republican -- his name was Charlie Crist -- he wanted to impose cap-and-trade on Florida.
0.0	0.085920970374	Yes.
0.0	0.170029298386	Bill, I defeated Mario Cuomo.
0.0	0.33270107819	And I do believe, and I would disagree somewhat with one of my colleagues, this is a genocidal threat.
0.0	0.174537048811	John Harwood, there's a bigger issue here.
0.0	0.218002428178	People say, "Oh, you don't like China?"
0.0	0.213271653426	You just have to look today at Indonesia, bombings all over.
0.0	0.446053334858	This debate needs to be about the men and women across this country that are struggling on a daily basis to provide for their families the better future that we've always said this country is all about.
0.0	0.0595710654997	Not good.
0.0	0.247670125339	It's an important one that we should be engaged in.
0.0	0.111380440711	They're a great family.
0.0	0.267226471156	May I offer a different generation's perspective on this?
0.0	0.390438290091	When I ran in Texas, I told the people of Texas, "if you elect me, I will lead the fight against amnesty."
0.0	0.420671190216	Imagine how hard it is for these people out there that are making 40, 50, $60,000 a year, and they're trying to provide for their families at a time when this economy is not growing.
0.0	0.2797642839	We lost thousands of lives, thousands in Iraq.
0.0	0.257894902923	But my wife is down here in the front, and I'm sure, if you'd like to talk to her later, she can give you more than you'll ever be able to take care of.
0.0	0.178186046328	But here's the real key.
1.0	0.975110655267	They would give more tax breaks to the super-wealthy and corporations, not to the middle class.
0.0	0.153862796676	You know, maybe they're dumb and they don't know what they're going to get, but I don't think so.
0.0	0.513731256017	But here, a total net worth of -- net worth, not assets, not -- a net worth, after all debt, after all expenses, the greatest assets -- Trump Tower, 1290 Avenue of the Americas, Bank of America building in San Francisco, 40 Wall Street, sometimes referred to as the Trump building right opposite the New York -- many other places all over the world.
0.0	0.336955581691	But the idea that you can't -- that you're just gonna grow your way out of this -- I have a plan to grow the economy at 4 percent, but you're gonna have to make adjustments for both Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.3909192693	I have the experience as a prosecutor, attorney general, governor, United States Army intelligence veteran, governor during the 9/11 attack, chairman of the Terrorism Commission for this country.
0.0	0.401034691507	You know, a minute ago, Neil asked: What has President Obama do -- done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns?
0.0	0.160875922107	That would be a disaster for this country.
0.0	0.150527250582	Listen, I want to just comment.
0.0	0.226433623056	... so you don't actually want to hear the answer, John?
0.0	0.0477010884257	I would change them.
0.0	0.00430451372677	Thank you.
0.0	0.312224543942	All without any government mandates whatsoever through the marketplace.
0.0	0.00630271700303	We are not France.
0.0	0.348967775742	But the leaders have come forward to realize that protest is fine, but violence is wrong.
0.0	0.254385154148	No Jeb, I don't remember -- well, let me tell you.
0.0	0.425370234541	It means, come out from the shadows, pay a fine, earn legal status by working, by paying taxes, learning English.
0.0	0.123816581581	-- fix America, this is the formula.
0.0	0.294445098355	And we keep young people on our policies until they turn 26.
0.0	0.244510755319	But I just have to tell you that it's best with some of these things not be said.
0.0	0.359349375718	What we need is leadership in this country which revitalizes American democracy, and makes people understand that if they stand up and fight back and take on the billionaire class, we can bring about the change that we need.
0.0	0.5	States need to stop cutting higher education, and we should create a new block grant program that keeps the states' skin in the game, and we should lower these outrageous interest rates that parents and kids are being charged by their own government.
0.0	0.228718427679	And I'm very grateful to the brave Navy SEALs who carried out that mission.
0.0	0.245779566641	And said, well, she said you were angry and I said to myself, huh, she's right.
0.0	0.172324917661	It's what happened in Governor O'Malley's state.
0.0	0.229315549155	In Ferguson, for every 100 African-American women, there are only 60 African-American men.
0.0	0.447567323784	We have to get down to creating a country that's not going to have the kind of problems that we've had with people flying planes into the World Trade Centers, with the -- with the shootings in California, with all the problems all over the world.
0.0	0.289277534718	For a start, the secretary and I disagree -- and I think the president does not agree with her -- in terms of the concept of a no-fly zone in Syria.
0.0	0.311325030979	And I went there, and for 16 years, I fought the insiders and was able to get things done.
0.0	0.267256071293	Well, I believe, and I know that if Iowa helps make me the Republican nominee, I will defeat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.0678352634507	I happen to think...
0.0	0.316646819053	The issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24 months ago.
0.0	0.307774327706	So they soybean sales from Iowa, entire soybean production goes -- the equivalent of it goes to China.
0.0	0.224646946076	Three specific reforms that reflect those principles.
0.0	0.274781260486	We honest to god are here to get this country back on track.
0.0	0.0226720661381	Yeah.
0.0	0.156952720501	... ground and air.
0.0	0.655890543212	Why is it...
0.0	0.231796153899	And that's what we have= representing us.
1.0	0.952368116427	And on Common Core, Common Core has been eliminated in New Jersey.
0.0	0.338196383246	And some of them, I will say, not all, have called me and said, "Donald, thank you very much; you're exposing an unbelievable problem and we have to get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.190741706098	We are doing both at the same time.
0.0	0.295779641689	But we have to also be very clear that we do have some continuing challenges.
0.0	0.232070134458	I think he has addressed a lot of these issues that have been quite difficult, but he has gone forward.
0.0	0.166017891277	Nothing's gonna get done.
0.0	0.122373184709	I want a job."
0.0	0.260916485716	Well, Senator, look, I think we're in vigorous agreement here.
0.0	0.378119569722	But think of it, GDP below zero, horrible labor participation rate.
0.0	0.475666958079	But what the DNC did arbitrarily without discussing it with us is shut off our access to our information crippling our campaign.
0.0	0.527064789904	And by the way, the attack he keeps throwing out on the military budget, Marco knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion.
0.0	0.200239174454	And that's the difference between somebody who knows how to do this and somebody who's never done it before.
0.0	0.307458967929	The fact is in New Jersey, what we have done is to make it easier now to get a conceal and carry permit.
0.0	0.370203769848	Both Donald and Jeb have good points, and there is a middle ground.
0.0	0.104916073152	You get together.
1.0	0.526542086413	Nancy, the blueprint in Maryland that we followed was yes, we did in fact raise the sales tax by a penny and we made our public schools the best public schools in America for five years in a row with that investment.
0.0	0.303426428724	ISIL is trying to create themselves into a new state.
0.0	0.411316947046	Drugs have taken far too many of our citizens.
0.0	0.150785726228	That is not consistent conservatism, that is political calculation.
0.0	0.427334488368	But the real number, the real number is anywhere from 18 to 19 and maybe even 21 percent, and nobody talks about it, because it's a statistic that's full of nonsense.
0.0	0.119881575076	May I respond?
0.0	0.229521981671	I feel like I need -- I feel like I need a Washington to English dictionary converter, right?
0.0	0.188783828343	Well, John, I don't really have any weaknesses that I can think of.
0.0	0.333537231169	We reduced violent crime to 30-year lows.
0.0	0.31500254508	Look, the conservative message is economic growth and along with economic growth goes opportunity for everybody in America.
0.0	0.145350953118	I opposed and oppose legalization and citizenship.
0.0	0.154685765498	We lose, we have a trade imbalance...
0.0	0.0128251359066	That's a blessing.
0.0	0.245654551271	I think it ought to be a compact -- families contribute, kids contribute.
0.0	0.178814759121	... (inaudible) opening statement.
0.0	0.160313487724	We need a collaborative approach.
0.0	0.311887487555	Examine our records, pray on it and I will be honored if you and your family will come caucus for us on Monday night.
1.0	0.958472759972	But I want to -- I want to follow up on something having to do with leadership, because, you know, today Senator Sanders said that President Obama failed the presidential leadership test.
0.0	0.379818752382	And if they have to be in the Middle East for 20 or 30 years no problem.
0.0	0.0104958272417	It's not my PAC.
0.0	0.293567508819	A politician other than the people in the states -- I don't want to -- a politician cannot get them to pay.
0.0	0.362737775215	Run the company kids, have a good time.
1.0	0.225032436987	It's never below zero.
0.0	0.345236436254	Now, this takes, David, 18 months to 24 months, two years.
0.0	0.148950716932	The Secretary's obviously right.
0.0	0.427390510164	As president, I will support law enforcement and we'll stop radical terrorist attacks in this country by supporting our intelligence community and law enforcement community.
0.0	0.323282770411	The fact is if we don't address what's costing so much, we can't throw enough money at this.
0.0	0.291750741909	Last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee.
0.0	0.0593521298486	Excuse me, John.
0.0	0.145489421917	Well I want to comment on this.
0.0	0.233012358312	So we need people -- I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.117806291091	But they should have the right of determine -- self-determination.
0.0	0.229796614747	But let me go back to something that's very important.
0.0	0.22363961388	Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point?
0.0	0.417204643602	I have proposed there be a Middle East NATO so that we can combine our allies there to stand up to Iranian expansion, and at the same time join together to begin to stop and this ISIL thing before it becomes an actual state.
0.0	0.085920970374	Yes.
0.0	0.276265486075	Everybody is under fire and under attack, and we have to stand together as an alliance.
0.0	0.358796748652	And let me, by the way, take this moment to congratulate Hillary Clinton, who I thought not only did an outstanding job as our first lady, but redefined what that role could be.
0.0	0.441086553909	Akin to slavery, where people came into this country to do guest work were abused, were exploited, and if they stood up for their rights, they'd be thrown out of this country.
0.0	0.107985665601	Let's have a Democratic Syria.
0.0	0.464620677236	Number two, I want Medicare to be able to negotiate for lower drug prices just like they negotiate with other countries' health systems.
0.0	0.295412056086	It's the evil government that is -- that is putting all these regulations on us so that we can't survive.
0.0	0.197856454281	They talked about environmental, they talked about all sorts of crap that had nothing to do with it."
0.0	0.213528173952	Why don't we let the process work.
0.0	0.103131936027	...numerically, it's gonna be higher.
0.0	0.344409857719	You don't solve it by big talk where you're banning all Muslims and making it harder for us to build the kind of coalition for us to be successful.
0.0	0.0909856212698	Yes, I apologize.
0.0	0.250753746142	It was a coalition made up of Arabs and Americans and westerners and we're going to need it again.

0.0	0.170102914441	Hey look, he never had a chance.
0.0	0.063814651827	But we're not gambling.
0.0	0.374520951922	I would begin by saying that I'm not sure it's a weakness, but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for America's future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people.
0.0	0.153674116546	I...

0.0	0.0642864296492	We got it.
1.0	0.390328810945	In Florida, we have the lowest in-state tuition of any state, because there's accountability, just as John said.

0.0	0.436518626367	I will tell you, you could win a bet at a bar tonight, since we're talking about fantasy football, if you ask who the top three states in America are that produce solar energy: California and Arizona are easy, but number three is New Jersey.
0.0	0.413492733552	They want a political revolution in which millions of Americans stand up, come together, not let the Trumps of the world divide us, and say, you know what, in this great country, we need a government that represents all of us, not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.

0.0	0.473406137928	Well, I believe that there are abuses, those companies should be permanently barred from ever using the program again and we should put strict standards in place to ensure that they're not being abused, like the prevailing wage requirement and like the advertising requirement.
0.0	0.134109162804	It's true, and these are the best and the finest.
0.0	0.191597481494	I would like to see it updated.

0.0	0.336668398693	... people all over this country -- not you, Secretary Clinton -- are shouting at each other.
0.0	0.434347391887	We both agree that we have to get unaccountable money out of our political system and that we have to do much more to ensure that Wall Street never wrecks main street again.

0.0	0.34840795729	The days for the Clintons in public housing are over.
0.0	0.189031623116	So, I would pass legislation outlawing abortion after 20 weeks.
0.0	0.440225311194	You know, we could give you another example -- the Marines, the Army, these wonderful six soldiers that were killed.
0.0	0.351771772317	And we are going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fall.
0.0	0.433950469665	We have to go after terrorist networks, predominantly ISIS -- that's not the only one, but let's focus on that for a minute.
0.0	0.426463329339	And having been in New Hampshire and here in Iowa, but in New Hampshire, I just received the support of seven out of eight of the newspapers in that state because they see positive, they see unity, they see coming together, and they see a record of change and a record of accomplishment.

0.0	0.287531073371	You're talking about $2.7 trillion.
0.0	0.241780498283	One of your colleagues interviewed me.
0.0	0.270287377202	You're not going to even allow them to come to our country?
0.0	0.371091111181	You know, we have to stop this because, you know, if we manage to damage ourselves, and we lose the next election, and a progressive gets in there and they get two or three Supreme Court picks, this nation is over as we know it.
0.0	0.387337735113	And if our middle class makes more money, they spend more money, and our whole economy grows.
0.0	0.104925730923	The formula is working.
0.0	0.227322480987	You know, every election we hear a lot of talk.
0.0	0.140276763121	Let me respond to...
0.0	0.397123727684	The United States has, unfortunately, been victimized by terrorism going back decades.
0.0	0.281936848722	We're going to fight it as hard as we can, and we're going to fight whoever the Republicans nominate who will depend on the Koch Brothers, and others.
0.0	0.342372777094	We need to get back in the game as it relates to our Arab nations.
0.0	0.242749061888	We both made the identical promises.
0.0	0.371709953282	You cannot make rash statements and expect the rest of the world to respond as though, well, it's just politics.
0.0	0.10252288959	Republicans and Democrats alike believe this.
1.0	0.333589055854	You know, not only do I have hundreds of thousands of donors, most of them small.
0.0	0.347187094945	You know, for the 45-year-old construction worker out there, who is having a hard time making things meet.
0.0	0.0530198349095	Do we have answer for that?
0.0	0.0158997846068	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
0.0	0.124189041621	Bernie Sanders, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.
0.0	0.221082026172	Every election we talk about this.
0.0	0.100280030247	It is enormously complicated.
0.0	0.350424210828	The first thing -- I don't know of anyone who's not in favor of fully vetting people that are trying to come into this country, other than perhaps Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.00657879709171	...Chris...
0.0	0.347089330655	We've got to eliminate the gun show loophole.
0.0	0.191552458442	This is absolutely disgusting, and revolts the conscience of the nation.
0.0	0.308426691332	They lost a lot of money, everybody said it couldn't be done.
0.0	0.529593668742	When CEO income has risen 90 percent above the average worker, when the bottom 90 percent of this country's economy has had stagnant wages for the past 40 years, somebody is taking it in the teeth.
0.0	0.132423941063	It's not fear and terror, it's reality.
0.0	0.18679841595	See when you're a senator, what you get to do is just talk and talk and talk.
0.0	0.0164699592527	I was for legalization.
0.0	0.0965278066742	And, look, there are profound differences...
0.0	0.159927166165	And there are many ways of doing it.
0.0	0.239967384357	We've got to have them be part of our coalition.
0.0	0.0599359940322	Please go to berniesanders.com.
0.0	0.343145590002	Well, to start with, unlike President Obama, I'll actually name the enemy that we confront.
0.0	0.332269810028	And it is a -- the kind of criticism that we've heard from Senator Sanders about our president I expect from Republicans.
0.0	0.352201470476	And for 30 years, the issue of immigration has been about someone who's in this country, maybe they're here illegally, but they're looking for a job.
0.0	0.30953766029	Nobody, nobody will be pushing us around.
0.0	0.118999940296	We need to reverse that.
0.0	0.27284426129	You're not going to be able to ram down the throat of the American people your approach.
0.0	0.125455670198	I like Marco Rubio.
0.0	0.183795685289	Our vets have been abandoned.
0.0	0.452647625164	Well, we have invested nowhere near what we should be investing in human intelligence on the ground.
0.0	0.0952753864854	It's making...
0.0	0.116562068751	He's not arming the Kurds.
0.0	0.41551504938	Now, it is true that there are a bunch of lobbyists, and a bunch of Democrats in this state spending millions of dollars trying to convince the people of Iowa that I somehow oppose ethanol.
0.0	0.178032628518	It's not that complicated actually.
0.0	0.0827496243415	John, could I follow up on this?
0.0	0.154211296207	My budget was mentioned.
0.0	0.509681099636	There is one major country -- the United States -- which ends up spending almost three times per capita what they do in the U.K. guaranteeing health care to all people, 50 percent more than they do in France guaranteeing health care to all people, far more than our Canadian neighbors, who guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.346564955219	I think it is fair to say, whatever the complaints that you want to make about him are, that with respect to China, one of the most challenging relationships we have, his opening up China and his ongoing relationships with the leaders of China is an incredibly useful relationship for the United States of America.
0.0	0.199670984588	Let me get a chance to respond.
0.0	0.264856142255	And I have the feeling you're going to find a lot of cost overruns there and a lot of waste and duplicative activities.
0.0	0.194763642407	We could do a whole show on that.
0.0	0.21356571731	The world has changed.
0.0	0.188372665827	... first of all...
0.0	0.300897709212	Simply expanding Medicaid does not improve health care outcomes.
0.0	0.221529374523	That we do all that we can to create a world of peace and prosperity.
0.0	0.0633611587143	We don't want to be Sweden.
1.0	0.418374277597	We have 400,000 small businesses forming every year in this country.
0.0	0.439099929811	It's now half the size of what it was prior to Operation Desert Storm.
0.0	0.0846492123015	I'm tested.
0.0	0.3977678485	So whoever is part of the family of a president has an extraordinary privilege of not only having a front row seat on history but making her or maybe his contribution.
0.0	0.258834267716	In my family, my dad fled oppression in Cuba to come to America.
0.0	0.110382070562	But we don't see it happening at all.
0.0	0.206469786963	I think we all support it.
0.0	0.398304742183	So what I say to those people who go to Donald Trump's rallies, understand: He thinks a low minimum wage in America is a good idea.
0.0	0.435837821571	And one of the reasons in some states why the percentage cost has gone up so much is because governors there would not extend Medicaid.
0.0	0.461456776786	I mean, what we had was something the government made -- basically a bag of gas -- that cut loose, destroyed everything in its path, left thousands of people powerless, but they couldn't get rid of it because we had too much money invested in it, so we had to keep it.
0.0	0.452394123081	Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well.
0.0	0.302794807788	I think if you do not understand that our Judeo-Christian values are one of the reasons why America is such a special country, you don't understand our history.
0.0	0.244996422227	So yes, you're going to hear a lot of talk about tax reform --
0.0	0.655890543212	...
0.0	0.0913309138324	We saw a dictator overthrown.
0.0	0.242631139928	Just for the record.
0.0	0.0783325839971	But here's what's going to happen:
0.0	0.00430451372677	Thank you.
0.0	0.655890543212	That's what it is.
1.0	0.385434892309	And I'm very proud that for the first time a majority of my donors are women, 60 percent.
1.0	0.446450190765	And may I point out that under Ronald Reagan's first term, the highest marginal rate was 70 percent.
0.0	0.433950797744	Now what we have to take on is the pharmaceutical industry that is ripping off the American people every single day.
0.0	0.470918849581	On top of that, there is a business flat tax of 16 percent.
0.0	0.380670212579	So let's move toward what we should be doing as a nation and follow the values of our immigration history and begin to make it possible for them to come out of the shadows and to have a future that gives them a full chance of citizenship.
0.0	0.261457646545	You've got to be able to bring together conservatives and evangelicals and libertarians, and stitch together a winning majority.
0.0	0.174600068844	It's very bad for us.
0.0	0.0861566370286	It's not fair trade.
0.0	0.405264397392	... passed comprehensive gun safety legislation with a ban on combat assault weapons, David.
0.0	0.288673055468	You know, everybody says every election's important, and there's truth to that.
0.0	0.242440597435	Do you really think that these people are interested in Yemen?
0.0	0.297018212857	If I'm elected president, we will repeal every word of Obamacare.
0.0	0.259095153271	There is no money in the Medicare account.
0.0	0.0127483360414	No, John.
0.0	0.323401570334	If I am elected president, keep an eye on the tarmac, because I'll be back, because Iowa in 2017 will not be fly-over country.
0.0	0.328366012319	Well, Bret, first that's not entirely the story.
0.0	0.250816875186	And I think Ted Kennedy had a very clear idea about what needed to be done.
0.0	0.317002216517	Abroad, we need a coalition that is going to take on ISIS.
0.0	0.0164286199651	Dynamically.
1.0	0.986692514272	I have vetoed a reduction this clip size.
0.0	0.485053253985	I can tell you, after spending seven years as a former federal prosecutor, right after 9/11, dealing with this issue.
0.0	0.256909852879	We're a country of laws, Bill.
0.0	0.446552442566	If you don't have talented people, if you don't have great leadership, if you don't have people that know business, not just a political hack that got the job because he made a contribution to a campaign, which is the way all jobs, just about, are gotten, free trade terrible.
0.0	0.5	In this administration, every weapon system has been gutted, in this administration, the force levels are going down to a level where we can't even project force.
0.0	0.41460805121	Those jobs, in many cases, are now gone.
0.0	0.270761250787	I try to live by the rules, no matter what they are, and I was brought up that way as a kid.
0.0	0.335135320067	Look, the threat we face from ISIS is unprecedented.
0.0	0.114823559978	We need more principle.
0.0	0.438826099274	But when millions of people stand up and are prepared to take on the insurance companies and the drug companies, it will happen, and I will lead that effort.
0.0	0.295716204597	Because, I've got to tell you the truth, even in New Jersey what you're doing is called rude.
0.0	0.209270852788	Well, Neil, I'm glad we're focusing on the important topics of the evening.
0.0	0.465141819072	But I also think that these are very serious times; 75 percent of the American people think the federal government is corrupt.
0.0	0.0948123817438	I like it.
0.0	0.242277494657	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.155224255777	Let me (inaudible).
0.0	0.361926836894	We have fought, as Democrats, for decades to get a health care plan.
0.0	0.373554617591	Maybe now we can get it moving again so that we can upgrade it so that it does include all the tools and everything in our arsenal that we can use to try to work with our allies and our friends, come up with better intelligence.
0.0	0.122434686432	Barack Obama wants to change America.
0.0	0.0401922690798	She voted for it.
0.0	0.364858795369	You know, back in September, my friend Donald said that he had had his lawyers look at this from every which way, and there was no issue there.
0.0	0.361089770686	There are other attorneys that feel, and very, very fine constitutional attorneys, that feel that because he was not born on the land, he cannot run for office.
0.0	0.0833028346807	Everybody knows that.
0.0	0.328866527989	Many are in this building.
0.0	0.475033075264	I've spent my entire life, since I started as a young lawyer for the Children's Defense Fund, trying to figure out how we can even the odds for so many people in America, this great country of ours, who are behind, who don't have a chance.
0.0	0.508521078658	I also propose that we can pay for this with a tax on high volume trades and we need to because my dad came to college after World War II on a G.I.
0.0	0.161601680984	They've got to be broken up.
0.0	0.400160636448	I have no clue whether the federal government is the proper place, my instinct is to say, hell no, just about everything about the federal government.
0.0	0.447992643895	You have to reform Social Security, and the simple way to do it is to make sure that the wealthiest don't receive the same benefits as people that are lower-income.
0.0	0.159393600207	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.0866951203186	He was the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan.
0.0	0.434324527763	And the fact is that what I did do, what I did do from the beginning, Chris, as soon as I found out about it, I fired the people who were responsible.
0.0	0.410951370712	And nobody, nobody on either one of these stages has done more than I've done and the people of the State of Texas to deal with securing that border.
0.0	0.35770861887	We saw a Muslim brotherhood president installed, and then we saw him ousted and the army back.
0.0	0.0402701853988	OK.
0.0	0.229477257388	To get the information from Hillary Clinton, you need to get a subpoena from the FBI.
0.0	0.157420509224	When I'm president, that will change.
0.0	0.3759005969	So, are we going to ban Muslims from India, from Indonesia, from countries that are strong allies -- that we need to build better relationships with?
0.0	0.173352468716	Neil, my name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.128059054644	We're up 347,000 jobs.
0.0	0.377800036842	I have yet to see a proposal that you're describing that the -- raising the cap would apply to passive income.
0.0	0.366745411026	It's the only way to level the playing field between big and powerful and small and powerless.
0.0	0.130227801167	They're tough, they're strong, they're great people.
0.0	0.312899920894	I cautioned about a quick overthrow of Mubarak, and we now are back with basically an army dictatorship.
0.0	0.116118312504	There will be a process.
0.0	0.289217086884	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.3900918969	And if you're going to leave this to Hillary Clinton, the person who gave us this foreign policy, the architect of it, and you're going to give her another four years, that's why I'm speaking out as strongly as I am about that.
0.0	0.203104800324	And I just couldn't agree -- disagree more with those kinds of comments.
0.0	0.280201299706	I think, actually, people are looking for that in Washington now.
0.0	0.394934969236	The number of heroin deaths are growing very, very significantly.
0.0	0.183136980087	But this is what you're seeing in the Republican debate that you didn't see in that Democrat debate.
0.0	0.0647324301891	I don't want it.
0.0	0.214100516966	So let's set the facts straight.
0.0	0.0409102666853	I'm too trusting.
0.0	0.0972951238242	So nice, thank you very much.
0.0	0.249177259451	And he asked me to support that.
1.0	0.45342659759	I am tired of sending $300 billion overseas to buy oil from people who hate our guts.
0.0	0.390541510903	In terms of Wall Street, I respectfully disagree with you, madam secretary, in the sense that the issue here is when you have such incredible power and such incredible wealth.
0.0	0.372418719212	In my own state, for example, we launched an investigation, asked the FBI to cooperate.
0.0	0.425063769214	And I can do it without raising the debt, without raising taxes on the middle class and making it reasonably manageable within our budget so that we can be fiscally responsible at the same time.
0.0	0.40017484681	And so people are still going to get health care, thankfully, in emergency rooms, in hospitals.
0.0	0.14773384078	Well, you know what?
0.0	0.248672203901	And it's something that can be done, and I get questioned about that.
1.0	0.512018221733	Well, the average small manufacturer, whatever they're manufacturing, drugs or anything, if they have less than 50 employees, the average cost in terms of regulations is $34,000 per employee.
0.0	0.165616653686	We're not going to dismantle everything.
0.0	0.354145702285	It is not a radical idea to say that a single mom should be earning enough money to take care of her kids.
0.0	0.234213848097	A lot of the rights that have been won over years, from women's rights to voter rights to gay rights to worker rights, will be at risk.
0.0	0.29518534834	Our role in the world is not to roam the globe looking for new dictators to topple.
0.0	0.253378632777	They can do business with Iran, or they can do business with America, and I am very confident they're going to choose America before they choose the Iranian economy.
0.0	0.347590159038	Well, we did have a plan, and I think it's fair to say that of all of the Arab leaders, Gaddafi probably had more blood on his hands of Americans than anybody else.
0.0	0.0675486812578	It's not true.
0.0	0.233554054371	In fact, that's part of the problem.
0.0	0.319075643728	Close the gun show loophole, close the online loophole and...
0.0	0.282905897298	The NSA is another big issue.
0.0	0.470612450224	There were four dissenters, and they said that they believe the Second Amendment protects no individual right to keep and bear arms whatsoever, which means, if their view prevailed and the next president's going to get one, two, three, maybe four Supreme Court justices, the court will rule that not a single person in this room has any right under the Second Amendment and the government could confiscate your guns.
1.0	0.389044713757	You know, the FBI director, the president's appointed FBI director has said this week that because of a lack of support from politicians like the president of the United States, that police officers are afraid to get out of their cars; that they're afraid to enforce the law.
0.0	0.331379241963	Well, I have what I call the new college compact.
0.0	0.0931586988734	They're not sending you.
0.0	0.655890543212	...
0.0	0.268600547707	Look, I am in the establishment because my dad, the greatest man alive was president of the United States and my brother, who I adore as well as fantastic brother was president.
0.0	0.0599640396104	I think that is...
0.0	0.416303071506	When somebody is addicted and seeking help, they should not have to wait three, four months in order to get that help.
0.0	0.1095957742	America's at a crossroads.
0.0	0.353294691673	And this president turns his back -- this president doesn't enforce the marijuana laws in this country because he doesn't agree with them.
0.0	0.356213827634	Look, every time the Federal Government gets engaged in something it gets worse.
0.0	0.103699531794	So Hillary and I have a difference.
0.0	0.459259661426	But I believe coming from a state that has virtually no gun control, I believe that I am in position to reach out to the 60 or 70 percent of the American people who agree with us on those issues.
0.0	0.421261211915	And we should never be convinced to give up those freedoms in exchange for a promise of greater security; especially from someone as untried and as incompetent as Donald Trump.
0.0	0.309230217715	And you had better get rid of them, because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.265024769614	The simple fact is, we all have a record.
0.0	0.13170475919	It's harder to talk to your enemies.
0.0	0.297407099918	I have a friend who's a doctor, and he said to me the other day, "Donald, I never saw anything like it.
0.0	0.124162126495	That is absolutely not right.
0.0	0.117973658225	Then I looked at Rubio.
0.0	0.132624206319	See, they don't like that.
0.0	0.249661033812	CLINTON: Oh, wait a minute, senator.
0.0	0.234620478187	Here is the case, they both agree, they can't make a deal.
0.0	0.254759303876	And John Kerry described it as attacks that would be unbelievably small.
0.0	0.156058536657	It better not be Bernie Sanders.
0.0	0.185462537967	No, because if you look at the quote, and it's very specific.
0.0	0.403297513217	And multiple reputable journals, including The Wall Street Journal, said ours is the best.
0.0	0.339922931835	She put American intelligence officers at risk for her convenience.
0.0	0.655890543212	That has not been...
0.0	0.186697827802	And people said "you can't win, you can't change the culture."
0.0	0.32150538097	And not only did I fight them and win, I lived to tell about it and I'm standing on this stage tonight as evidence of that.
0.0	0.163137344964	... on the issue -- on the issue of citizenship, Donald...
0.0	0.25622756714	America is back in the leadership business.
0.0	0.439543292226	As I said before, we are a land of immigrants, but we have to be intelligent about the way that we form our immigration policies, and that's one of the reasons that I have called on us to declare war on the Islamic State because we need to reorient our immigration policies and our visa policies for people who are coming into this country because there are many people out there who want to destroy us.
0.0	0.379120256996	There are other ways to lead and to be a moral leader in this world, rather than at the opposite end of a drone strike.
0.0	0.0948123817438	I like them.
0.0	0.101163510034	That's what I said.
0.0	0.25911429945	So I want us to have a very tough screening process but I want that process to go forward.
0.0	0.12757182866	Or that we're just going to be great?
0.0	0.386201080893	That they were going to have to hire 20,000 new IRS agencies to collect it.
0.0	0.381117086646	Well first of all, the idea that somehow we're better off today than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated president of the United States is totally an alternative universe.
0.0	0.0869059478512	Right.
0.0	0.392985650304	But the first task is to bring countries together to destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.38151134769	And Turkey, by the way, did a very decent thing, providing what was reasonable housing and conditions for those people.
0.0	0.112598075596	Not my kind of guy.
0.0	0.297418414502	You know, she only had a third-grade education, but -- you know, she knew how to stretch a dollar.
0.0	0.0165577652614	I can't do it.
0.0	0.192236252563	You know, I think abortion is always wrong.
0.0	0.394002630364	And if I were president of the United States right now, I'd be lining up our allies to say that, if one crossed T or one dotted I does not occur, they are -- violate the agreement, we slap back on sanctions.
0.0	0.26648339053	You know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money.
0.0	0.329228473161	And I promise I will never be in a bicycle race.
0.0	0.365493442009	I know that you now have your data back, and that there has been an agreement for an independent inquiry into what did happen.
0.0	0.41747281441	Where the secretary and I have a very profound difference, in the last debate -- and I believe in her book -- very good book, by the way -- in her book and in this last debate, she talked about getting the approval or the support or the mentoring of Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.0363186190759	That's crony capitalism.
0.0	0.2045318113	I'll tell you, in my family there are a lot of single moms in my family.
0.0	0.467028160931	And then, after the war, this is the guy who, in fact, yes, you're right, he opened up relations with China, and now pushed various type of trade agreements, resulting in American workers losing their jobs as corporations moved to China.
0.0	0.203210738943	And I want to just suggest to you.
0.0	0.0958564681585	...eliminates the business...
0.0	0.319568005034	They will not bring us -- believe me -- to the promised land.
0.0	0.203147443679	... you're not going to have peace in Syria with Assad in charge.
0.0	0.191668258194	Do senators have the right to disagree with the president?
0.0	0.147719860912	And you have to really work hard at it.
0.0	0.0393921145171	Unintended consequences.
0.0	0.138687283072	Let's reverse the immunity.
0.0	0.179898016697	Our country is in crisis.
0.0	0.144745874692	Does my family like me?
0.0	0.340235501958	Right now, you don't have the -- you have taxes that are too high.
0.0	0.375556812965	Look, we have waiting lists for veterans that are -- that are leaving because of the sequester where we're gutting the military.
0.0	0.0277462445194	But look...
0.0	0.444219109162	There was a minimum wage at the state level, and some places went higher.
0.0	0.0723752838202	We have to do something.
0.0	0.0454648148401	And there's a lot.
0.0	0.432706196737	We have a world that's out of control and has grown dangerous and a president that is weakening our military and making our foreign policy unstable and unreliable in the eyes of our allies.
0.0	0.415379868764	But, more importantly, to train a Sunni-led force in Syria to take out ISIS with our support...
0.0	0.165655547235	He is a good man.
0.0	0.259590460781	Probably, I don't know -- you people write the stuff.
0.0	0.148387907024	Yeah, but let me respond...
0.0	0.403354841311	The FCC jumping in now and saying, "we're going to put 400 pages of regulation over the Internet," is going to create massive problems.
0.0	0.301141846875	He just writes out an order, executive order.
0.0	0.256273170158	We don't even know that we have the cards, because our leaders don't understand the game.
0.0	0.245176370115	It's why you see the pharmaceuticals getting together.
0.0	0.537122610337	I'm running for president because our economy is rigged because working people are working longer hours for lower wages and almost all of new wealth and income being created is going to the top one percent.
0.0	0.303846258605	Now, what I think is that right now we have got to do our best in developing positive relations with Russia.
0.0	0.371858496508	Three times, she refused to answer the question, because she refuses to be held accountable for anything that goes wrong.
0.0	0.320571989589	But they will not be paying, Martha, any private insurance.
0.0	0.224441276012	You've got to give people hope.
0.0	0.397618950933	Governor Huckabee's exactly right, we need to honor the promises made to our seniors, but for younger workers -- look.
0.0	0.245683431939	And -- and -- and the last piece of this, Maria, is this.
0.0	0.174265637055	We saw what happened in Egypt.
0.0	0.292227208347	I just don't believe that this country's days are going to be deeply -- you know, going down.
0.0	0.160820792329	Folks, we've got to wake up.
0.0	0.137384094796	We just can't do it any longer.
0.0	0.143933503243	Kathie, this was not merely theory in Maryland.
0.0	0.524919011241	Yes, I do believe that we must end corporate loopholes, such that major corporations year after year pay virtually zero in federal income tax, because they're stashing the money in the Cayman Islands.
1.0	0.251957683105	And he says, the president's appointee, that crime is going up because of this.
0.0	0.161292772974	We did a lot to help.
0.0	0.280575314332	And Bernie Sanders will tell them that it's because of the rich.
0.0	0.240345225732	What I've always said is that this issue does need to be solved.
0.0	0.210823793763	But what my parents did accomplish is they were able to send both of their sons to college.
0.0	0.153237567299	Today, I'm 60, I'm not married, I don't have any kids.
0.0	0.0735079175498	That is an egregious act.
0.0	0.232635440248	You ought to just be able to get over it, get used to it...
0.0	0.286405613011	John, this is another one of those examples.
0.0	0.363841125435	As you know, he came to Vermont to campaign for me when he was a senator.
0.0	0.31270659735	... and I know Bernie, and I can promise you he's not going to be president of the United States.
0.0	0.372246070839	The student loan problem has been created by government.
0.0	0.118589600781	I've done it.
0.0	0.303246717528	In fact, Washington said that democracy requires a virtuous people.
0.0	0.114832855582	It ain't going to happen.
0.0	0.451154290146	I am proud that I was the first member of Congress to take Americans over the Canadian border to buy breast cancer drugs for one-tenth the price they were paying in the United States.
0.0	0.397551518608	First of all, we recognize that we have a rigged economy, as you've indicated.
0.0	0.341661620797	And frankly, it just came out, and in Iowa now, as you know, Ted, in the last three polls, I'm beating you.
0.0	0.0939483949415	It can happen.
0.0	0.385610590041	And in whatever way the three of us can we need to move this agenda forward and begin to deal with the gun lobby and the intimidation that they present.
0.0	0.43120650641	Reinstating Glass- Steagall is a part of what very well could help, but it is nowhere near enough.
0.0	0.443382052897	Well, we have treated the drug-addicted in our prisons and we released them in to the community, and our recidivism rate is less than 20 percent.
0.0	0.316813722032	Young people for whom getting involved in politics is as, you know, it's like going to the moon.
0.0	0.393648614087	She admitted she had sent e-mails to her family saying, "Hey, this attack at Benghazi was caused by Al Qaida-like elements."
0.0	0.253181843697	It's the strongest pro-worker immigration plan.
0.0	0.283898721993	Secondly, a policy on recruiting and hiring, and then more resources for -- for training.
0.0	0.0724218833067	So I don't think...
0.0	0.173314976659	This isn't the governments money.
0.0	0.0226720661381	Yeah.
0.0	0.210290277283	But they're killing us economically.
0.0	0.21912258365	And they don't buy their guns from a gun store.
0.0	0.195122327077	I want to take off from that point and argue the same thing.
0.0	0.0679648245363	I'm proud of my family.
0.0	0.125312345032	I said, "Is he intelligent?"
1.0	0.976730942311	There aren't enough good-paying jobs, especially for young people.
0.0	0.265807242016	There are ways to retrain the 50 and 51-year-olds, because they've got great value.
1.0	0.957367055452	Someone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander in chief and someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi can never be president of the United States.
0.0	0.371888361241	I think that was one of the worst foreign policy blunders in the more than history of the United States.
0.0	0.14700686161	This is our time and our opportunity to do that.
0.0	0.161551517914	Such a nasty -- such a nasty question, but thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.393119298454	And I believe that one of the big failings in that region is a lack of human intelligence.
0.0	0.320878886304	They can't -- when they order the product and when they finally get the product it is taxed.
0.0	0.285725003018	But this election is not about our pedigree, this is an election about people that are really hurting.
0.0	0.268025500998	Like rich kids, they deserve to get a free education.
0.0	0.471579032598	And I used to say it, there are ships at sea, and this was during the worst crisis, that were loaded up with oil, and the cartel kept the price up, because, again, they were smarter than our leaders.
0.0	0.445185429204	And if that means taking on Wall Street, I have a plan that is tough and comprehensive and praised by a lot of folks who say it goes further than what both Senator Sanders and Governor O'Malley are proposing.
0.0	0.224827685442	They're concerned that Washington is so dysfunctional it is holding them back.
0.0	0.34732612907	They attacked us in San Bernardino two weeks ago.
0.0	0.379817424477	They don't care about American workers, they just care about bringing as many people in so they can get as many votes as they can.
0.0	0.355291523195	And if we capture any of these ISIS killers alive, they are going to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we're going to find out everything they know, because when I'm president, unlike Barack Obama, we will keep this country safe.
0.0	0.277857619926	The officer who told the victims of the San Bernardino killings that he would take a bullet before them.
1.0	0.438322924507	I have looked at -- I have looked at the legislation that Senator Sanders has proposed, and basically, he does eliminate the Affordable Care Act, eliminates private insurance, eliminates Medicare, eliminates Medicaid, Tricare, children's health insurance program -- puts it all together in a big program which he then hands over to the states to administer.
0.0	0.422730586628	Because he understands that I'm committed to a fair, and level playing field for every energy source without lobbyists, and without Washington picking winners and losers.
0.0	0.107330486446	Wait a minute.
0.0	0.226186066769	This mandatory sentencing, a very bad idea.
0.0	0.341206011431	I think it was a mistake to expand Medicaid everywhere in Ohio and across the country.
1.0	0.396343005238	He said, "we don't have leverage with China to get a better deal on Iran because we need them to lend us money to continue operating our government."
0.0	0.372944889577	So I think we need radical changes in the funding of higher education.
0.0	0.318823204175	We were proud of them on graduation day, but we're going to be proud every month for the rest of our natural lives.
0.0	0.432548668005	... and here's the critical point, Maria -- the business flat tax enables us to abolish the corporate income tax, the death tax, the Obamacare taxes, the payroll taxes, and they're border-adjustable, so every export pays no taxes whatsoever.
0.0	0.145076731173	Our next president...
0.0	0.222534742496	So there are people watching tonight in business.
0.0	0.369974218342	Truth is that far more blacks get stopped for traffic violations.

0.0	0.06087455101	I'm a fighter.
0.0	0.12986894426	But you know what we did in Maryland?
0.0	0.22691792572	As we all remember, Senator Obama, when he ran against me, was against the war in Iraq.
0.0	0.316677585648	Well, that creates an environment that's toxic in our own country.
0.0	0.0745453942142	So you know what?
0.0	0.0167656232527	No accomplishment.
0.0	0.0165577652614	We can't.
0.0	0.253682714131	I think President Obama has set a great example.
0.0	0.12201444034	Well, I would really appreciate that.
0.0	0.190549061964	We should be supportive of that effort.

0.0	0.200576638084	You have a problem with ISIS.
0.0	0.263523180396	For the people who say we can't do it, I say hell no, we can do it together.
0.0	0.447244730113	And a mom of a service member of ours who served two duties in Iraq said, Governor O' Malley, please, when you're with your other candidates and colleagues on stage, please don't use the term 'boots on the ground'.
0.0	0.238284281444	They will never make America great again.
0.0	0.206481439254	But furthermore, what we have got to do, I'm sorry, yes, I do believe that we have got to do everything that we can, and it will not happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.372896573233	Trying to get Iran and Saudi Arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter.
0.0	0.214718078936	That means education.
0.0	0.415119224124	The first one would be to my good friend, Bibi Netanyahu, to reassure him we will stand with the State of Israel.
0.0	0.179340128674	I don't think we're at war with all Muslims.
0.0	0.332282658791	You know, I won two record elections.
0.0	0.207319162034	So listen, this is the difference between being a governor and a senator.
0.0	0.347075851096	But realistically, even if they do, the money is flowing.
0.0	0.236750938458	This is not some small scale group.

0.0	0.0507245198697	That's American citizenship.
0.0	0.133697864087	If I was president, I'd say, "Congratulations.

0.0	0.178455154956	There have been some good recommendations about what needs to happen.
0.0	0.333705034534	I put together a coalition, including Arabs, with respect to Libya and a coalition to put sanctions onto Iran.
0.0	0.39809947936	Since he has changed his mind on amnesty, on health care and on abortion, I would just ask, what are the principles by which he will govern?
0.0	0.111135285174	This is a complicated issue.
0.0	0.085920970374	Yes.
0.0	0.250566233139	We were behind where we were today.
0.0	0.423504971951	We have one House member from Vermont, three candidates in the race.
0.0	0.176301440357	I would not want to go to that point.
0.0	0.406590060894	I am very proud, if my memory is not correct -- I think I am -- that I have a lifetime -- and I've been in Congress a few years -- a lifetime 100 percent pro-choice voting record.
0.0	0.350035923525	So it's unfair to say in total...
0.0	0.404124227496	But let me also tell you, one of the issues has got to be the integration of both community and police.
0.0	0.108798253335	What are the rules on who gets to follow up.
0.0	0.251232279461	I have a debt to America I'll never repay.
0.0	0.123523906371	They are ripping us.
0.0	0.312653710567	And number two, if we find out they're developing a nuclear weapon and we know how to get to it, we're gonna go take it out.
0.0	0.189684850423	We want to be the United States of America.
0.0	0.19768941656	But we are where we are right now.
0.0	0.213230831951	But I think to suggest that I have voiced criticism, this blurb that you talk about, you know what the blurb said?
0.0	0.28363781876	You know, I became a grandmother 15 months ago, and so I spent a lot of time thinking about my granddaughter's future.
0.0	0.160374374674	Wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.412661598338	Hey, I'm in the United States Senate, and anyone who doesn't think that there is an enormous amount of waste and inefficiency and bureaucracy throughout government would be very, very mistaken.
0.0	0.433543433656	We have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9/11, and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks, yet we see the terrible attack in San Bernardino and know that we haven't done enough.
0.0	0.394153007405	Well, first, let's remember why we became part of a coalition to stop Gadhafi from committing massacres against his people.
0.0	0.655890543212	I have...
0.0	0.193615156641	And then, of course, 9/11 happened, which happened before there was an invasion of Iraq.
0.0	0.336032977564	If you listen to the State of the Union the other night, he described them as a bunch of guys with long beards on the back of a pickup truck.
0.0	0.655890543212	No, no.
0.0	0.320673379513	I mean, literally, the Senate -- what is it, like a French work week?
0.0	0.255112661851	I'll give you another example.
1.0	0.976138620227	And yet they are seeing almost all new income and all new wealth going to the top 1 percent.
0.0	0.0956897930175	We lose on trade.
0.0	0.389857794249	And many of the fights that are going on are not ones that the United States has either started or have a role in.
0.0	0.0533203785972	When I was 22, my dad died.
0.0	0.386343631597	And they have a desire not simply to conquer the Middle East and to become the dominant power in that region, but ultimately to be able to hold America hostage.
0.0	0.24536161279	Well, first of all, I'm 7 and 0 in my fantasy league.
0.0	0.331788318001	We will rise to challenge of ISIL and we will rise together to the challenges that we face in our economy.
0.0	0.233924943467	Yes, we need to make it easier for parents to refinance.
0.0	0.486602832166	And we won't be using a man like Secretary Kerry that has absolutely no concept of negotiation, who's making a horrible and laughable deal, who's just being tapped along as they make weapons right now, and then goes into a bicycle race at 72 years old, and falls and breaks his leg.
0.0	0.297189505236	I think with this kind of barbarism and nihilism, it's very hard to understand, other than the lust for power, the rejection of modernity, the total disregard for human rights, freedom, or any other value that we know and respect.
0.0	0.381926140372	I have the best courses in the world, so I'd say, you what, if he wants to -- I have one right next to the White House, right on the Potomac.
0.0	0.44926583142	Thousands of thousands -- you look at the number of companies and the number in terms of manufacturing of plans that we've lost -- 50,000 because of China.
0.0	0.229825645088	Bill, here's the interesting position on this.
0.0	0.312389154634	We have a budget closer to $3.5 trillion.
0.0	0.347362785595	I certainly agree with FDR for all the reasons Senator Sanders said.
0.0	0.393068396336	We have to continue to work with the Iraqi army so that they are better prepared to advance on some of the other strongholds inside Iraq, like Mosul, when they are able to do so.
0.0	0.184144474493	Well, I want to know, did you win?
0.0	0.227758977185	You know, I know to a lot of people in the media, this is just a great big game, and we're the players.
0.0	0.222414818315	He's been a negative force.
0.0	0.18105535615	Does he stand up for law enforcement?
0.0	0.320723796882	And when America does not lead, the world is a dangerous and a tragic place.
0.0	0.353171224843	Iran is sponsoring terrorism in many parts of the world, destabilizing areas.
0.0	0.506293863559	And therefore, they don't get the income tax break, but their prices are going to be higher, because the vat tax is embedded in both the prices that business that are charging and in the wages they pay their employees.
0.0	0.424402908447	With respect to the United States, I think our role in NATO, our support for the E.U., as well as our willingness to take refugees so long as they are thoroughly vetted and that we have confidence from intelligence and other sources that they can come to our country, we should be doing our part.
0.0	0.400757986563	So I believe that over the next few years, not tomorrow, but over the next few years, we have got to move the minimum wage to a living wage, 15 bucks an hour.
0.0	0.376455767527	Fred Thompson was the other one, a man who had spent a lot of time on that screen.
0.0	0.39339228541	I want to go back for a second thought on this issue of income inequality.
0.0	0.358701896683	Fired, never hired again and probably shunned in their community.
0.0	0.308408891243	This is the same old stuff since I left.
0.0	0.0215634838556	I was not that candidate.
0.0	0.452850512244	Today in America we have more people in jail than any other country on earth, 2.2 million people.
0.0	0.020761801089	And there should be some regulation.
0.0	0.257137663939	Recognize that the caliphate is what gives them the legitimacy to go out on a jihadist mission, so we need to take that away from them.
0.0	0.35665860736	Because we can't just save the American Dream, we can expand it to reach more people, and change more lives than ever before.
0.0	0.506316262743	In fact, American consumers pay the highest prices in the world for drugs that we help to be developed through the National Institute of Health and that we then tested through the FDA.
0.0	0.456039199244	And I spent my entire lifetime balancing federal budgets, growing jobs, the same in Ohio.
0.0	0.273172019133	I looked into the eyes of moms and dads who would do anything in their power to protect our country's values and our freedoms.
0.0	0.390340839583	But if you want someone who has a proven, effective leadership, that was a governor of a state, that transformed the culture there, elect me so I can fight for the American people and change the culture in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.0596392703802	And that is what they told me when I was in Jordan in November.
0.0	0.334233597578	We have a lot of work to do with Iran before we ever say that they could move toward normalized relations with us.
0.0	0.190743610429	Wait a minute, who in their 16th month?
0.0	0.379969765241	You look at California, you look, frankly, at Paris where there's a -- the strictest no-gun policy of any city anywhere in the world, and you see what happens: 130 people dead with many to follow.
0.0	0.407175652257	You know how much money we spent on polio last year in America?
0.0	0.172322538405	If I'm president, there won't be stupid deals anymore.
0.0	0.340431603972	People have invested a lot of energy into that.
0.0	0.243616960416	At least he's honest enough to call himself a socialist.
0.0	0.283787328725	They've got to quit sponsoring Hezbollah and Hamas.
0.0	0.284087304831	Our country is in serious trouble.
1.0	0.353517427732	Right now, think of this: We owe China $1.3 trillion.
0.0	0.319178433282	That's why George Romney, Mitt's dad, was eligible to run for president, even though he was born in Mexico.
0.0	0.109171687484	You get a lot of them that are overrated.
0.0	0.23471238903	And so Senator Graham is right about this.
0.0	0.0773442473158	And he got nasty.
0.0	0.264332958137	We cannot let things get farther down the road, like we did with North Korea.
0.0	0.12594187583	It's their money.
0.0	0.375563140186	But, the real issue, I think, that the Senator is injecting into this is that if you had a Super PAC, like President Obama has, which now says it wants to support me.
0.0	0.341090491736	And one of his little boys said to him, "Dad, what happens if Donald Trump wins and we have to move out of our homes?"
0.0	0.191136234555	But it could be he'd want to be cool, and he'll wait until the next day.
0.0	0.32100133777	That's the establishment telling us to hide our conservative principles to get the left and the media to like us.
0.0	0.314941620716	That's what they do, whether it's the San Bernardino attack or if it's these tragedies that take place, I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is.
0.0	0.0869059478512	That's right.
0.0	0.378860480868	And I believe that we can springboard off of this new U.N. resolution, and we should create, as Secretary Clinton indicated, and I agree with that, that there should be a political process.
0.0	0.111379373136	And they're all over the place.
0.0	0.240212766894	And secondly, when you talk about me being on the board of Lehman Brothers, I wasn't on the board of Lehman Brothers.
0.0	0.223188580747	Meanwhile, the rich get richer.
1.0	0.415577509783	Becky, it is the height of hypocrisy for Mrs. Clinton to talk about being the first woman President, when every single policy she espouses, and every single policy of President Obama has been demonstrably bad for women.
0.0	0.368108174562	I believe that actually affordable college, debt-free college is the goal that we need to attain as a nation.
0.0	0.371933073776	I plead that it's very difficult when you deal with ISIS and organizations like that whose behavior is so barbaric and so vicious that it doesn't seem to have any purpose other than lust for killing and power and that's very difficult to put ourselves in the other shoe.
0.0	0.349720802575	But everything will be filed eventually with the government, and we don't extensions or anything.
0.0	0.156221095568	We need to get realistic about this.
0.0	0.322769189672	I think what our campaign is indicating is that the American people are tired of establishment politics, tired of establishment economics.
0.0	0.10367234322	So under President Trump, here's what would happen:
0.0	0.157483235008	You know, it's real estate.
0.0	0.152399007867	I'm totally open to a tariff.
0.0	0.340095492891	Let me just say on taxes, how long have we been talking about tax reform in Washington, D.C.?
0.0	0.189980199831	Two points.
0.0	0.245881609519	And I was on the front lines of that, looking into the eyes of my neighbors...
0.0	0.0869059478512	Right.
0.0	0.354754543458	You have to ban the people who are trying to hurt us.
0.0	0.394395828363	I like Marco too, and two years ago, he called me a conservative reformer that New Jersey needed.
0.0	0.15870379748	And Ben, you're a terrible surgeon.
0.0	0.271393138489	You know, we -- we agree that we've got to get unaccountable money out of politics.
0.0	0.272082895363	Well, if the law would change, yeah.
1.0	0.937195614781	In the past he has called him weak.
0.0	0.353292730223	We agree that Wall Street should never be allowed to wreck Main Street again.
0.0	0.470486236977	Two of them were among the most highly decorated -- they weren't allowed on a military base to have guns.
0.0	0.0876838024152	My point is this.
0.0	0.339057571885	Look, the truth is that a powerful nation like the United States, certainly working with our allies, we can overthrow dictators all over the world.
0.0	0.222595855529	You will have welcomed Heidi and our girls, Caroline and Catherine, into your homes.
0.0	0.261844167148	It took -- it took an arm and a leg to be able to set up a 401(k).
0.0	0.514463250888	...is the lowest personal rate any candidate up here has, and what it would also enable us to do is for every citizen to fill out their taxes on a postcard so we can eliminate the IRS.
0.0	0.0652529917261	I have to tell you.
0.0	0.281153068167	All these other people want to cut the hell out of it.
0.0	0.112488052703	They don't know what they're doing.
0.0	0.179686658102	We must insist on assimilation -- immigration without assimilation is an invasion.
0.0	0.1968175327	I'm never going to change my tune.
0.0	0.291032393956	We're on the verge of being the first generation of Americans that leave our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.0618186919978	That was before he was running against me.
0.0	0.405403993894	I guess the one I -- I would pick is the fact that I was part of a very small group that had to advise the president about whether or not to go after Bin Laden.
0.0	0.229602186705	So I have nothing at all critical of him.
0.0	0.15091167019	And they got a killer in San Bernardino in posing as a fiance.
0.0	0.371381220842	I don't know and with all due respect to the secretary, Wall Street played by the rules?
0.0	0.184044863903	You don't serve us.
0.0	0.180741778303	Enough said.
0.0	0.341856943466	How about Obamacare, a certified job killer?
0.0	0.237674513772	... of $50 billion...
0.0	0.31512691209	That's why I've been leading the fight to stop it.
0.0	0.280483618489	I was governor on September 11th, and I'm proud of my leadership in bringing New York through that time.
0.0	0.161271352124	This is revolutionary for education in America.
1.0	0.431324573788	I have voted time and again to -- for -- for the background check, and I want to see it improved and expanded.
0.0	0.144219245897	Let me tell you who Larry Tribe is.
0.0	0.0479371435484	Very valuable.
0.0	0.246565616569	We must keep America safe from this threat.
0.0	0.539270630911	Well, to put that in a context, Judy, I think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top one-tenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled.
0.0	0.280935818916	I used the laws of the country to my benefit, I'm sorry.
0.0	0.150388899823	And they're tired of being ripped off by everybody in the world.
0.0	0.328024634643	It is hard to find someone in my generation that thinks Social Security will be there for us.
0.0	0.240886220466	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.145087581143	It goes away.
0.0	0.462931129616	And remember the $5 billion Web site?
0.0	0.00430451372677	Thank you.
0.0	0.160973717171	It really is important that we go forward on this.
0.0	0.423668718062	We have a $19 trillion bipartisan debt and it continues to grow as we borrow money from countries that do not like us to pay for government we cannot afford.
0.0	0.253371061553	We will work with our Sunni allies.
0.0	0.411837790676	They're anxious about the fact that they are working incredibly long hours, they're worried about their kids, and they're seeing all the new income and wealth -- virtually all of it -- going to the top 1 percent.
0.0	0.305321169793	They're taking money from Social Security and they're going to spend it on the military and they're going to spend it on domestic spending.
0.0	0.262356049919	It costs me $3.
0.0	0.473162445218	It was country after country without making the investment in human intelligence to understand who the new leaders were and the new forces were that are coming up.
1.0	0.983587284073	And we were able to put our city on the path for the biggest reduction in crime of any major city in America over the next ten years.
0.0	0.268330752621	Let me agree with much of what the secretary and the governor have said.
0.0	0.191228480023	But I think they will see a very good option here.
0.0	0.317515590113	But we allowed people to keep health care.
0.0	0.463885313363	It's tax-free -- a huge advantage for our farmers and ranchers and manufacturers -- and every import pays the 16 percent business flat tax.
0.0	0.110095799373	That is who I'm fighting for.
0.0	0.337641730922	We just heard an argument back and forth that we can't solve immigration.
0.0	0.388428746174	I have gone time and time again to take on the vested interests who would keep women's health care decisions the province of the government instead of women ourselves.
0.0	0.476349857765	Twenty-four months ago, 36 months ago, you did not have a group of radical crazies named ISIS who were burning people in cages and recruiting people to enter our country legally.
0.0	0.239901460026	Well, let me -- let me first of all talk a little bit about my experience.
0.0	0.422127828184	Now, the fact is, what this president has done is invited Russia to play an even bigger role, bring in Vladimir Putin to negotiate getting those chemical weapons back from Assad, yet what do we have today?
0.0	0.413711684976	Well, let me tell you one thing that I am the only guy: The only guy that has consistently fought the Clinton machine every election I was ever in over the past 26 years.
0.0	0.391334312776	I was a mayor for eight years, worked very closely with a great police department.
1.0	0.464676854682	But just think about this-- since we last debated in Las Vegas, nearly 3,000 people have been killed by guns.
0.0	0.077842879225	I don't like that.
0.0	0.482688178389	Until we have a president of the United States that gets up every day and goes to the Oval Office with the intent purpose of securing that border, and there's not anybody on either one of these stages that has the experience of dealing with this as I have for over 14 years with that 1200-mile border.
0.0	0.414086477422	And when you have insider information, which apparently has been the case, where people use that information and use big data to try to take advantage of it, there has to be some regulation.
0.0	0.132125621968	I know this, I certainly am.
0.0	0.112488052703	They don't know what they're doing."
0.0	0.258470721348	So I want to explain why this is not in America's interest to react with this kind of fear and respond to this sort of bigotry.
0.0	0.0608196793253	Well, thank you.
0.0	0.329178580022	Number one, if they violate it, we need to move against them.
0.0	0.237562413631	And I agree with much of what the Secretary and the Governor have said.
1.0	0.058089736358	We passed it after 9/11.
0.0	0.358506090177	That's why as commander in chief, I will take on ISIS, not only because it keeps us safe, but because it allows us to absolutely conduct our religious affairs the way we find in our heart and in our souls.
0.0	0.3528769503	And, people are sick of believing that the government is never going to really address this.
0.0	0.263143398175	I know it isn't something you just hope people will do and I've worked on that...
0.0	0.344428856312	We have to provide the NATO support to back up the mission that is going on.
0.0	0.242377019153	Let me hear if there's any difference between the Secretary and myself.
0.0	0.182456504964	They all want me to support them.
0.0	0.0181152466481	We have losers.
0.0	0.0172616416064	Creativity.
0.0	0.272200470829	I'm very proud that NARAL endorsed me because when it comes to it we need a leader on women's issues.
0.0	0.244955696412	I want to use that same up here, whatever it may be to make America rich again and to make America great again.
0.0	0.170099194815	I mean, Chris will know about that.
0.0	0.257952948757	Well, John, let me concur with you and with all Americans who are shocked and disgusted by what we saw in Paris yesterday.
0.0	0.289704747482	And what I have said is I will not throw us further into debt.
0.0	0.274353310316	As governor, we continued to work together.
0.0	0.274861079001	They understand that there's a national security risk.
0.0	0.208330963193	So I don't think you can paint with a broad brush.
0.0	0.314332717281	He pushed through, and he passed the Dodd-Frank regulation, the toughest regulations since the 1930's.
0.0	0.14908157469	It's not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.260133032653	Well, there are so many, I don't know where to start.
0.0	0.400950222775	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the free enterprise system.
0.0	0.382137479774	I am a little skeptical about your governor actually caring enough about higher education to make any kind of commitment like that.
0.0	0.257322913971	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.482865172447	(BELL RINGS) ... and there's a reason, when Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer came after our right to keep and bear arms, that I led the opposition, along with millions of Americans -- we defeated that gun control legislation.
0.0	0.478952906082	And my record was one of cutting taxes each and every year.
0.0	0.162065217219	And by those standards, we're not doing particularly well.
0.0	0.37942252351	Number one, the people negotiating don't have a clue.
0.0	0.350166218413	ISIS, now, is the major priority.
0.0	0.286990196144	I'm asking folks not just to join my campaign, but join a cause.
0.0	0.381162440443	I cannot tell you how much our nation is threatened and how we need a commander in chief who understands the threats to this nation.
0.0	0.222499568402	What else we can do is that we should believe in science.
0.0	0.227540919961	But Secretary Clinton, you've been on three sides of this.
0.0	0.380993267815	We need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources, but from sources overseas, that can be a real-time fusion effort to get information where it's needed.
0.0	0.246456975315	This is an incredibly complicated region of the world.
0.0	0.173022663919	They always keep our equipment.
0.0	0.252831027576	And I know that term gets my Republican friends nervous.
0.0	0.309280603154	It's a blessing that we're living longer, so we have to increase the retirement age to reflect that blessing.
0.0	0.461253710605	Now, Ford announces a few weeks ago that Ford is going to build a $2.5 billion car and truck and parts manufacturing plant in Mexico.
0.0	0.172805471071	It has not been in effect during the administration of Barack Obama.
0.0	0.383519645715	But the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with Iran, maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world, yes, that is something I want to achieve.
0.0	0.232706112379	And, I think there should be no mandates, and no subsidies whatsoever.
0.0	0.256032703004	I will stop Iran from getting nuclear weapons.
0.0	0.429971156601	We have ended the terrible situation that people with pre- existing conditions were faced with where they couldn't find at any affordable price health care.
0.0	0.108865923881	I hope the Supreme Court upholds them.
0.0	0.266094515376	First of all, Nikki this afternoon said I'm a friend of hers.
0.0	0.275158814569	And I think we've got to be really thoughtful about how we're going to afford what we proposed, which is why everything that I have proposed I will tell you exactly how I'm going to pay for it; including college.
0.0	0.123316031354	Our president doesn't have a clue.
0.0	0.249635006318	But I do take what Alan Krueger said seriously.
0.0	0.344924873533	I may not be your dream candidate just yet, but I can assure you I am Hillary Clinton's worst nightmare.
0.0	0.413367239065	We need to bring together our European and our Sunni Arab allies, and we need to develop a strategy together to take on ISIS every place that it is around the world, so that together, all of us can take ISIS out, destroy it, and then move on to come back to our country, protect our homeland security and make sure that the American people are safe.
0.0	0.364589241373	It's called the value added tax.
0.0	0.395966107093	I just think there's got to be a way, and I would hope that our tech companies would work with government to figure that out.
0.0	0.419262310058	Obviously, in the first, we do have to have a -- an American-led air campaign, we have to have Arab and Kurdish troops on the ground.
0.0	0.157317123437	We're running surpluses.
0.0	0.103974475255	This is a war for the soul of Islam.
0.0	0.493529856874	We have to invest in the local partnerships, and the best place to intervene, the best indicator of when a person is actually on the verge of killing themselves because of an addiction, is at the hospital.
0.0	0.00430451372677	Thank you.
1.0	0.299131422872	And, that's with zero percent interest rates.
0.0	0.327774633937	We're closing hospitals, we're closing wards, we're closing so many because the states want to save money.
0.0	0.655890543212	...
0.0	0.231788214609	I'd suggest people take a look at it.
0.0	0.204511763585	And so, you go the extra mile.
0.0	0.208542148006	Lehman Brothers was not a big bank.
0.0	0.26257781807	I have a plan that I've put forward to go after ISIS.
0.0	0.125090703901	I just left Indonesia -- bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb.
0.0	0.276082085625	Can I share this quick story?
0.0	0.308762335616	But the good news is the next commander-in-chief is standing on this stage.
0.0	0.241242447346	It's time for real substance and real experience.
0.0	0.0701440937714	And he is a proud American Muslim.
0.0	0.452019747309	For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses closing than starting.
0.0	0.357730532985	I have the largest bank in the world as a tenant of mine.
0.0	0.397699561801	I mean, you looked at Bush, it took him five days to answer the question on Iraq.
1.0	0.956698497879	We are now doing an independent internal investigation to see who else was involved.
0.0	0.285100421027	Now, when it mattered, he stood up and took on Wall Street.
0.0	0.114609013351	Here's the bottom line.
0.0	0.237185883617	If somebody put me on their homepage, they did it without my permission.

0.0	0.269235869667	It's perfectly legal in this country to change your mind.
0.0	0.109420991186	Go ahead.

0.0	0.303932102285	We've worked hard our whole life to provide a better family -- a better life for our family.
0.0	0.464303740925	We cannot fix things in this country -- the Social Security, the border, balancing the budget, getting wages to grow faster -- unless we lead as conservatives, but we also invite people in from the other party.
0.0	0.128026888787	They can have it anyway you want.
0.0	0.0865268044193	Well, I did.
0.0	0.383328559226	That's the way it should be, and I'm going to continue to reach out to thank all my online contributors for everything they are doing for me, to encourage them and help me do more just as Senator Sanders is.
0.0	0.205331318117	So, I mean this may seem like a bit of an arcane discussion.
0.0	0.269637553667	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.228936288235	That has to be enforced absolutely with consequences for Iran at the slightest deviation from their requirements under the agreement.
0.0	0.156036255436	I'm just saying.
0.0	0.156524459027	Take it to the bank.
0.0	0.247921994359	We now finally are where we need to be.
0.0	0.180751360878	We need to rebuild our families.
0.0	0.364289990183	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.20424690323	And let me tell you what the answer better not be.
0.0	0.0490972991161	Both served.
0.0	0.269159757842	It had missed, before I had arrived, expectations for nine quarters in a row.
0.0	0.176496664662	And yes, I was fired over a disagreement in the boardroom.
0.0	0.421274869392	In fact, just last week, I introduced the Life at Conception act, which would say that the 14th amendment would defend an individual even in the womb.
0.0	0.357796122657	One of the best things that was done, and George W. Bush did this and I give him credit, was to reach out to Muslim Americans and say, we're in this together.
0.0	0.238111266975	I don't want campaign contributions from corporate America.
0.0	0.358510171991	We do that, this country would be safe and secure again not only from criminals but from the terrorist who threaten us as well.
0.0	0.336647168224	Now, who are the people who are hurt by that?
0.0	0.201812014942	If a soldier has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.195209170368	I'll give you a fact.
0.0	0.229386146122	Well, let me tell you what the country should really be worried about.
0.0	0.283623599646	I am the only person on this stage who has actually...
0.0	0.143555374142	My patients are beside themselves.
0.0	0.383130338517	But we have to restore policing that will actually protect the communities that police officers are sworn to protect.
0.0	0.111128498851	I'm happy to answer the question...
1.0	0.0900920902447	We owe Japan more than that.
0.0	0.374988771296	How do we utilize our intellect rather than allowing the government to use its, quote, "intellect," in order to help us to be able to live healthier and better lives?
0.0	0.410235544789	If you look at a single mom buying groceries, she sees hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent.
0.0	0.0791998576981	The Obama administration.
0.0	0.17076863848	You know, I've always had a great deal of respect.
0.0	0.410090589792	Everybody said it was going to be three hours, three and a half, including them, and in about two minutes I renegotiated it so we can get the hell out of here.
0.0	0.219262310734	His first election and his re-election.
0.0	0.30517681009	And you've seen a little bit of this emerging in the -- in the African Union and the things that they have done to better stabilize Somalia.
0.0	0.058989320747	Thank you for that question.
0.0	0.33297136821	There was nobody to talk to and it really did give me an insight into the very difficult problems presidents face.
0.0	0.0745453942142	We know about the Belgians.
0.0	0.376631838569	I'm also going to take a bottle of White-Out with me to get started on all those executive orders that Mr. Obama has put his name to.
0.0	0.204719067129	Let's get rid of Assad later.
0.0	0.10830351608	Fine, I'll take it.
0.0	0.0487418198525	That's off the table...
0.0	0.21221558368	I never said that.
0.0	0.329581900365	My friend Kashif, who is a doctor in Maryland; back to this issue of our danger as a democracy of turning against ourselves.
0.0	0.0725843908026	You're right.
0.0	0.246145336864	If you stack that up it would be a three-story building.
0.0	0.139957718955	John, I think somewhere between...
0.0	0.168940187133	It became popular after the attack in Paris, and San Bernardino.
0.0	0.20953375407	And I had to confront the possibility of being a single parent.
0.0	0.329989799228	The endorsements that I am proud of are leading conservatives like Iowa's own Congressman Steve King, who is a national co-chairman of my campaign.
0.0	0.249735955727	That's why I've entered this race, and I think I have the experience to do it.
0.0	0.272318466042	That's wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country.
0.0	0.191321335364	Why in God's name does Wall Street...
0.0	0.437441722784	For too long -- no, for too long, what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our people's jobs, and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us.
0.0	0.274918995847	I believe that all of our kids should go into an income-based repayment plan.
0.0	0.0571175341824	And universities.
0.0	0.413406261165	And that's why this study, which shows that if you can believe it today, for white working class people between 45 and 54, life expectancy is actually going down.
0.0	0.468514592767	Almost 60 percent of American people now need to hire an expert to understand their taxes.
0.0	0.365866736752	We have to end -- education has to be local.
0.0	0.19305827533	Get rid of the fraud.
0.0	0.0865741777251	Thank you very, very much.
0.0	0.241298743205	We'll be filing it right on time.
0.0	0.10567044687	Just a little bit.
0.0	0.31380189921	So we need new leadership -- yes.
0.0	0.430026297932	Why not go to Congress and in a bipartisan way, begin to deal with the process of mental health issues so that people that are spiraling out of control because of mental health challenges don't have access to guns.
0.0	0.378063276687	You know, we're building on Pennsylvania Avenue, the Old Post Office, we're converting it into one of the world's great hotels.
1.0	0.945098803371	You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don't agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements.
0.0	0.574325906319	So beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given -- bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money.
0.0	0.349050086014	Well, we're going to have to redo the way the prescription drug industry does business.
0.0	0.36957130117	I trust Iowans, Granite staters (ph), people in South Carolina, people in Nevada, to start this process out.
0.0	0.0898079496299	It is not tough talk.
0.0	0.366353027847	I believe we stand together to address the real issues facing this country, not allow them to divide us by race or where we come from.
0.0	0.447805814775	We're going to suspend and repeal every executive order, every regulation that cost American jobs and is -- is -- is impacting our freedom.
0.0	0.34782753346	We need, and only the three of us will do this, nobody on the Republican side will even admit there's a problem.
0.0	0.158523850661	So was Ted, but now he says it wasn't so.
0.0	0.398393447851	We got a military that needs equipment all over the place.
0.0	0.282253908267	And so when we talk to our allies and we give them our word, in a Christie administration, they know we're going to keep it.
0.0	0.339699440119	I'm asking people to support me because I think I'm the most qualified, experienced, and ready person to be the president and the commander- in-chief.
0.0	0.0695809195613	Let me...
0.0	0.437989607051	Tonight we have a different debate than the debates that we have been allowed to have so far, because tonight is different because of this reason, that in the course of this presidential campaign America has again been attacked by jihadi terrorists, American lives taken from us.
0.0	0.164061280317	Now Maria, listen.
0.0	0.231154135666	Who do you know will defend life, marriage and religious liberty?
0.0	0.32932469438	We can create a situation where wages begin to rise.
0.0	0.12102051087	Those are all really positive developments.
0.0	0.361195258204	...incentives for people to keep people healthy, rather than giving the incentives to treat them when they're sick?
0.0	0.0786221939926	You just can't do it.
0.0	0.248362328371	Yesterday, the president stunningly admitted this.
0.0	0.253717233299	I know what it's like to owe that money, and we've worked hard.
0.0	0.173974188991	And I do carry on occasion, sometimes a lot.
0.0	0.268683827202	...in the world for people...
0.0	0.422994316616	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.0933148407727	It's not going to happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.271844664641	Number one, he won't want to give up his lifestyle."
0.0	0.429516198718	It was the most highly sought after -- or one of them, but I think the most highly sought after project in the history of General Services.
0.0	0.213366344699	Maria, let me clear something up here.
0.0	0.270594857597	We need to be on the side that keeps Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.371678387115	If you're running for president of the United States and you don't understand that we need more American ground forces in Iraq and that America has to be part of a regional ground force that will go into Syria and destroy ISIL in Syria, then you're not ready to be commander in chief.
0.0	0.352969331507	We'll hire 20,000 new border agents instead of 20,000 new IRS agents.
0.0	0.105000852095	We were attacked from Afghanistan.
0.0	0.346620905972	And worse -- worse yet, to be honest with you, Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster.
0.0	0.2082110009	...is paid -- played fairly.
0.0	0.116387106303	And it's an honor to have everybody here.
0.0	0.334324101413	And it is from the lessons from history that we do this because if we allow this to fester, we're going to have Islamic terrorism, multi-generations of it all across this country.
0.0	0.370786234048	The Libyans turned out for one of the most successful, fairest elections that any Arab country has had.
0.0	0.389731014503	And after four or five years in Brooklyn, I ventured into Manhattan and did a lot of great deals -- the Grand Hyatt Hotel.
0.0	0.382979835825	We can slap on sanctions alone, on day one, but it's not gonna be anywhere near as effective.
0.0	0.404079087976	I also said that we should take increased numbers of refugees.
0.0	0.306647022374	I'm tired of seeing what's going on, between the border where the people flow over; people come in; they live; they shoot.
1.0	0.979717810207	We're spending $80 billion a year locking up fellow Americans.
0.0	0.378176976766	And this is one of the myths that the left perpetrates on our society, and this is how they frighten people and get people to shut up.
0.0	0.23710936176	I think that what we're facing with ISIS is especially complicated.
0.0	0.0918526055885	Don't know that.
1.0	0.0937090072333	I didn't have an involvement with them.
0.0	0.436950217198	And I would hope, Senator Sanders, that you would join the Democrats who are trying to close the Charleston loophole, that you would sponsor or co-sponsor legislation to remove the absolute immunity.
0.0	0.240017691044	Well, let me just -- let me just say, once again...
1.0	0.963136552026	In 1988, just to set the record straight governor, I ran for the U.S. House.
0.0	0.339435250309	And I am very grateful for all my predecessors and my successors because each of them not only did what she could to support her husband and our country but often chose to work on important issues that were of particular concern.
0.0	0.423815889157	Next thing that we do, real unemployment -- official unemployment, 5 percent, real employment 10 percent, youth unemployment, off the charts.
0.0	0.137746407748	Again, with all do respect to Secretary Clinton...
0.0	0.545492784516	And I believe I can, because I have a proven record, a record of accomplishment, a record of cutting taxes, of shrinking the government, of reforming education, of challenging the status quo, eliminating career civil service protections, shrinking the government workforce by 11 percent, but leading the nation in job growth.
0.0	0.451916186836	I think we ought to give Ukraine offensive weapons and I think we ought to fight them on the economic basis because Putin is a one- horse country: oil and energy.
0.0	0.40683737058	But I think it's important to understand there's a significant difference that I have with Senator Sanders about how best to provide quality, affordable health care for everyone.
0.0	0.288687723848	The only reason why you're doing it now is because we're running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.
0.0	0.343432110156	And I ask everyone in America to call Congress tomorrow and say enough is enough; no more debt.
0.0	0.215701662266	Now I am the only candidate up here that doesn't have a super PAC.
1.0	0.951993824173	As soon as we learned that they looked at that information - we fired that person.
0.0	0.267840560947	And, I can tell, some of the candidates, they went in.
0.0	0.56504678878	Trillions of dollars have gone from the middle class and working families to the top one-tenth of one percent who have doubled the percentage of wealth they now own.
0.0	0.0381701516054	What about hydroelectric power?
0.0	0.130143604885	But it's a lot safer.
1.0	0.313975945773	Two hundred children have been killed.
0.0	0.37893900565	People can promise you something, I delivered in the blue state of New York.
0.0	0.412363380415	We need to be very well aware of the fact that China and Russia are using technology to attack us, just as ISIS is using technology to recruit those who would murder American citizens.
0.0	0.389726148985	I am convinced because I see how he works with his attorney general, not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.271331622548	And that's what we need to be doing to the best of our ability in our country.
0.0	0.263745845462	Next, we have to talk to our adversaries, and we have to make sure they understand the limits of our patience.
0.0	0.122498615769	They're absolutely false.
0.0	0.346098670236	The president wants to do things without working with his Congress, without working with the legislature, and without getting the consent of the American people.
0.0	0.151134685964	Well, I -- if I might.
0.0	0.414343932085	The fact is that there was a great effort made by the Obama administration and others to really send a clear message, because we knew that so many of these children were being abused, being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border.
0.0	0.486168319382	And I give you my word, if I am elected president, no service man or service woman will be forced to be on their knees, and any nation that captures our fighting men will feel the full force and fury of the United States of America.
0.0	0.38191067049	Manufacturing will flow back into this country.
0.0	0.40318001329	Barack Obama got his massive tax increase, and there was no spending cuts.
0.0	0.338781047398	Saudi Arabia without us is gone.
0.0	0.5	But I did pass a more progressive income tax and asked the highest-earning people to pay another 14 percent.
0.0	0.133822819191	We have to rebuild our infrastructure.
0.0	0.0748832303432	No, it's your record.
0.0	0.318313446882	I watch the speeches of these people, and they say the sun will rise, the moon will set, all sorts of wonderful things will happen.
0.0	0.300379061105	We don't need to raise taxes to get this done.
0.0	0.438448185415	I think half of the -- more than half of the people in my own state of Vermont, my guess here in New Hampshire, are gun owners.
0.0	0.207326142288	But I'm not deciding that anybody's got to make these decisions the way that I do, on the basis of what I do.
0.0	0.655890543212	Megyn?
0.0	0.341814471502	We have people that have no incentive to work.
0.0	0.139324512057	We say "we're gonna protect."
0.0	0.368090047266	Well, they're the ones not listening to the scientists today, because doctors say that at 20 weeks that is a viable life inside the womb.
0.0	0.361410369735	I am not asking Wall Street or the billionaires for money.
0.0	0.254269631979	People were shocked, Trump got it.
0.0	0.0561293110059	They're a scam.
0.0	0.351958532506	Why do -- why, over her political career has Wall Street been a major -- the major campaign contributor to Hillary Clinton?
0.0	0.370898667012	And -- and I would note indeed, the reason I said that is I was asked -- my friend Donald has taken to it as (ph) advance playing Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the USA", and I was asked what I thought of that.
0.0	0.00430451372677	Thank you.
0.0	0.206895148679	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.489142953154	I don't think you expand entitlements when so many people are dependent on government and when the money the federal government is offering is going to be taken away from you after just a couple of years.
0.0	0.347910212205	We need to address our security issues, we need to address the economic issues around the kitchen table.
0.0	0.290454946367	He is not the only one.
0.0	0.164539561373	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the Constitution.
0.0	0.289367622964	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.383163745278	If we are not successful, if we continue the same old, same old of Washington being run by corporate lobbyists and big-money interests, nothing changes.
0.0	0.235758033654	Get rid of the waste and abuse, but save it.
0.0	0.357552542539	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.178313988602	We talked about criminal justice reform.
0.0	0.303004493805	It is a different, fundamental military strategy than what we've seen from Barack Obama.
0.0	0.405814183539	And my analysis is, that you are going to get more taxes out of middle class families.
0.0	0.322718681778	I want to go back to what we were talking about earlier, this budget deal in Washington.
0.0	0.152203473376	They'll all come back.
0.0	0.176394815102	They don't know if it worked.
0.0	0.0134026313108	She was naturalized.
0.0	0.358192030692	Now, the challenge we're seeing today is that the Supreme Court is being converted into some type of political body.
0.0	0.0706115866947	There's give and take.
0.0	0.0382720041916	This stuff is fantasy.
0.0	0.134913976876	We don't eliminate Medicare.
0.0	0.167722681705	It takes away discretion from judges.
0.0	0.085920970374	Yes.
0.0	0.183161495248	ISIS has brought down a Russian airliner.
0.0	0.133035525195	Good evening.
0.0	0.210055024877	And somebody walked in and shot them, killed them.
0.0	0.244172056859	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.157325379442	If there was a -- and you know I'm not bringing a suit.
0.0	0.2764366782	It's the New York Times, they are always wrong.
0.0	0.389307284976	Well, first let me address the tax issue because it's related to the entitlement issue and I want to thank you for holding a substantive debates where we can have debates about these key issues on taxes.
0.0	0.338233349135	You blindfold the American people so that they cannot see the true cost of government.
0.0	0.202842538912	I've been passionate my whole life about the Constitution.
0.0	0.360718680285	And then he cut and run because it wasn't popular amongst conservatives, I guess.
0.0	0.299841570191	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.0935338129306	We haven't done so.
0.0	0.397103288658	When the Social Security program was started in the 1930s, not very many women worked.
0.0	0.248871771954	But if we don't know right and wrong, I think we have lost our way.
0.0	0.371367749807	We actually took action to do these things and as president, I have put forward 15 strategic goals that will make wages go up again for all American families.
0.0	0.00430451372677	Thank you.
0.0	0.518431311789	But the greatest gains, percentage-wise, for people, are gonna be at the lower end of our plan, and here's why: because in addition to a general personal exemption, we are increasing the per-child tax credit for working families.
0.0	0.5	And you wanted to know the numbers, the Tax Foundation, which has scored every one of our plans, shows that this plan will allow the economy to generate 4.9 million jobs, to raise wages over 12 percent, and to generate 14 percent growth.
0.0	0.126921298745	The Europeans have moved on.
0.0	0.0825152072016	We hate all the Muslims, because all of the Muslims are terrorists.
0.0	0.295899571496	You know, need to stop allowing political correctness to dictate our policies, because it's going to kill us if we don't.
0.0	0.331190223868	It's "give me options on how I can make it harder for law-abiding people to buy guns."
0.0	0.05021131099	They're right about that, but I'm doing it.
0.0	0.186532860062	We need security.
0.0	0.399750271179	So I put together this statement, and the only reason I'm telling you about it today is because we really do have to get going, because if we have another three or four years -- you know, we're at $8 trillion now.
0.0	0.402327599493	And you put me on that stage against her next September, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.567569393588	If we were to raise the marginal rate to 45 percent for people earning more than a million dollars and if we tax capital gains essentially the same we do earnings from hard work and sweat and toil, you could generate $800 billion over the next ten years and that would do so much good for affordable college, debt-free college, cutting youth unemployment in half, investing in our cities again.
0.0	0.292609628617	I'm very much against the government being involved in every aspect of our lives, you know?
0.0	0.400039620051	On day one in the Oval Office, I would make two phone calls.
0.0	0.286953210854	(inaudible), the great majority of Republicans and Americans believe in a hopeful future.
0.0	0.0635359695305	But they're not good.
0.0	0.269340110906	Let me do that but let me pick up on an issue, a very important issue that we have not yet discussed.
0.0	0.0593673078039	They throw down asphalt, and they throw.
0.0	0.391014976775	Because for the last 24 hours, with those issues being so urgent to people as they tune in tonight, wondering how they're even be able to buy presents for their kids.
0.0	0.45869200151	This is one of the areas I've disagreed with Senator Sanders on, who has called for Iranian troops trying to end civil war in Syria, which I think would be a grave mistake.
0.0	0.0438922815299	We have problems with Russia.
0.0	0.270483074888	And so in no way have I ever said that I don't embrace my father or love my father or appreciate everything that he has done for the country.
0.0	0.271556545505	That's where crime is happening in these cities where they don't enforce the immigration laws.
0.0	0.103743611667	... and I'll tell you why.
0.0	0.0599640396104	Think about it.
0.0	0.118052229993	The answer is yes.
0.0	0.392760765965	This president every chance he has ever gotten has tried to undermine the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.229277085669	Our country doesn't win anymore.
0.0	0.244172056859	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.205159720859	I love the Chinese people but they laugh themselves, they can't believe how stupid the American leadership is.
0.0	0.0630954008014	There are other racial discrepancies.
0.0	0.355706217139	But the average person takes out about $350,000.
0.0	0.354195272834	And we got to fight like crazy so people can think the American dream still exists, because it does, with rising wages, with full employment and with everybody in America -- and I mean everybody in America -- having an opportunity to realize the American dream of having a better life than their mother and their father.
0.0	0.286993805162	And I'm the one that made all of the right predictions about Iraq.
0.0	0.151111958962	And, you look at the questions -- "Donald Trump, are you a comic-book villain?"
0.0	0.43222250836	Because I don't think we should be imposing new big programs that are going to raise middle class families' taxes.
0.0	0.1571096637	I waited and I got the scars to show for it.
0.0	0.143179427046	We warned about the 9/11 attack before the 9/11 attack occurred.
0.0	0.351396164974	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.0157865421276	It's nice.
0.0	0.37290076675	I watched that town hall meeting with the Democrats the other night, and I heard Hillary Clinton asked a direct question by an Iowan, and that's what Iowans like to do.
1.0	0.271920796407	A lot of people up there can't get jobs.
0.0	0.0865268044193	... Well, no, no.
0.0	0.421891346214	Well, you just -- you just listed a litany of discredited attacks from Democrats and my political opponents, and I'm not gonna waste 60 seconds detailing them all.
1.0	0.0850114441971	Don't believe the 5.6.
0.0	0.295779889691	We're going to do a tax cut for all Americans.
0.0	0.098594943086	How do we decide on who gets to follow up?
0.0	0.443501648372	And it's because of the flip-flopping, political approach of Washington that both of my two colleagues on this stage have represented there for the last forty years.
0.0	0.0728499190467	He was young.
0.0	0.0865514241798	That was a terrible mistake.
0.0	0.309329149463	I will run on my record all day long.
0.0	0.00430451372677	Thank you.
0.0	0.214978809306	And it's not too much to ask of our generation after everything our parents and our grandparents did for us.
0.0	0.351241896638	You come into La Guardia Airport, it's like we're in a third world country.
1.0	0.968334863893	We have the world's best military, even though he's done everything he can to diminish it.
0.0	0.170129738082	Socialist and government dependent.
0.0	0.153179468526	Total propaganda.
0.0	0.231379073497	It is a tragedy for my state of Vermont.
0.0	0.0887291085708	Syria is a mess.
0.0	0.270190618231	Turns out that the African-American community and the Latino community were hit especially hard.
0.0	0.355592582936	You know, I think, again, both of us share the goal of trying to make college affordable for all young Americans.
0.0	0.222335014434	Well, this is what I would say.
0.0	0.370101488345	I met recently with some members of the Chaldean Christian communities and the wait times are a year, 18 months, 24 months.
0.0	0.508161955236	Three million women have fallen into poverty under this administration.
0.0	0.416134161926	I agree with President Obama who used executive orders to protect families because the Congress, the House was unable or refused to act.
0.0	0.220226799892	That's a part of the problem and I am going right at them.
0.0	0.29802325039	Most importantly, I think I understand leadership, which sometimes requires a tough call in a tough time.
0.0	0.453518986132	As Americans, we have shown ourselves to have the greatest military on the face of the planet, but we are not so very good at anticipating threats and appreciating just how difficult it is to build up stable democracies, to make the investments and sustainable development that we must as a nation if we are to attack the root causes of these sorts of instability.
0.0	0.259106439916	I mean, let me be honest with the people who are watching at home.
0.0	0.299139271688	But if that's the best the New York Times has got, they better go back to the well.
0.0	0.114941739208	Let it be for everybody.
0.0	0.224919425836	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.125173527684	And that's what you expect from a leader.
0.0	0.322043824471	So if you happen to be right, you could get the top job at the end of the day.
0.0	0.197382846656	I hope you will make a decision soon on this.
1.0	0.226031440129	They can't get jobs, because there are no jobs, because China has our jobs and Mexico has our jobs.
0.0	0.452752014337	So I have proposed debt free tuition, which I think is affordable and I would move a lot of the Pell Grant and other aid into the arena where it could be used for living expense.
0.0	0.395110378768	And I was going to tell you, whether I'm president or not, we better make it clear to the Saudis that we're going to support you, we're in relation with you just like we were in the first Gulf War, but you've got to knock off the funding and teaching of radical clerics who are the very people who try to destroy us and will turn around and destroy them.
0.0	0.26448138231	I said, "Oh, wait a minute, that's terrible.
0.0	0.112488052703	They don't know what they're doing.
0.0	0.392266682024	We have a strategy and a commitment to go after ISIS, which is a danger to us as well as the region... SANDERS (?
0.0	0.242675094455	We need somebody who can lead.
0.0	0.372240427333	I actually agree with Governor O'Malley about the need for common sense gun safety measures.
0.0	0.429660454474	I just read today in the New York Times, $250,000 for a 30 second ad.
0.0	0.245711819574	Look these are the things that we did in own state through the recession.
1.0	0.392119332054	We spent $2 trillion in Iraq, $2 trillion.
0.0	0.454971573353	You're looking at the -- at the man who introduced and fought on the floor as a freshman senator and passed the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 over two President Clinton vetoes.
0.0	0.208899520236	Well, obviously, you don't understand my views on homosexuality.
1.0	0.953571837768	Ronald Regan opposed the value tax because he said it was a way to blindfold the people, so the true cost of government was not there there for them.
0.0	0.344845896021	And this deal is giving him a pathway to a bomb, a missile to deliver it, and money to pay for it all.
0.0	0.371836658433	But you know what, you can make a middle class wage, you have decent health care, decent benefits.
0.0	0.189067141095	We need to figure this out together.
0.0	0.232039719654	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.160501900902	Whoever heard of this?
0.0	0.205981872283	We used to have victories, but we don't have them.
0.0	0.135396518505	You want me to answer that question?
0.0	0.212846084124	We also need a nominee, a candidate who will endorse our own principles.
0.0	0.257690906512	If you want someone who's not going to divide Washington, but gets things done, then you should make me your president.
0.0	0.116428407754	But, you know what we're not telling them?
0.0	0.375839822787	So this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement.
0.0	0.0650381095921	No, I think they won't.
0.0	0.211635888562	We have people that aren't smart.
0.0	0.0861464133329	Look, that's who I stand up for.
0.0	0.42731994389	I think the last eight years in the private sector have allowed me to see government from the outside, and I think that is a positive thing.
0.0	0.0840829769452	If that's not hypocrisy, I don't know what hypocrisy is.
0.0	0.0446602970305	So I would -- I would be willing to do that.
0.0	0.113828861557	The threat is Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.430543560634	The law itself requires a background check, but that didn't fulfill their part of the bargain within the time that they were supposed to do.
0.0	0.406841806794	That's why we embraced free enterprise, and it made us the most prosperous people in the history of the world.
0.0	0.125240999762	It's extraordinarily wrong.
0.0	0.432002180155	Now, you can support one now that's very low.
0.0	0.0873582185728	That's all I'm saying.
0.0	0.40199534039	You know, one of our biggest national security issues is the world looks at us some time, and we look at each other and say, why can't we solve problems?
0.0	0.237562413631	And I agree with much of what the secretary and the governor have said.
0.0	0.435560887793	But the first duty of the next president of the United States is to fix the mess at the Department of Veterans Affairs.
0.0	0.149790035128	There are a lot of factors involved in that.
0.0	0.246887056869	2016 is going to be a fight between conservatism, and a Democrat party that is undermining the very character of this nation.
0.0	0.294507209681	We have to show that we can march to a balanced budget.
0.0	0.208822620226	Nobody can solve it like me.
0.0	0.235647827456	He said, "You know, I make great product."
0.0	0.397745377733	Where basically, businesses now will have to pay a tax, both on the money they make, but they also have to pay taxes on the money that they pay their employees.
0.0	0.199200300291	-- the issue is who is going to get it done.
0.0	0.418661149515	But it was not on a second filing with FDIC and yes, I made a paperwork error disclosing it on one piece of paper instead of the other.
0.0	0.475904015466	We don't need the Federal Government to be involved in this, because when they do we create a $1.2 trillion debt.
0.0	0.30461189893	What you need to do is free up interest rates.
0.0	0.445083792887	We've got 11 million undocumented people in this country.
0.0	0.173022663919	They always keep our equipment.
0.0	0.655890543212	What do we do?
0.0	0.235390409563	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.42545411372	That expertise needs to spread all across the government and there needs to be much more cooperation with our private sector.
0.0	0.0255323075687	SuperPacs are a disaster.
0.0	0.224042609571	So let's focus on what this election is really going to be about.
0.0	0.264156189922	When it comes to ISIS, we will not weaken them, we will not degrade them, we will utterly and completely destroy ISIS
0.0	0.214085392131	Let me just jump in.
0.0	0.218452965273	There are hundreds of things like that.
0.0	0.221109746147	Well, that's a real question.
0.0	0.456694314436	I know that he has said in the two previous that he wants to take on this immunity issue because we need to send a strong message to the gun manufacturers, to the sellers, to the gun lobby.
0.0	0.380078991586	But now, that light is dimming a little, after seven years of Barack Obama.
0.0	0.0255323075687	It is a disaster.
0.0	0.0618196492708	I'm the only person...
0.0	0.346787564341	We can use it to break up the banks, if that's appropriate.
0.0	0.301405793179	There are loads of great ideas, great conservative ideas from wonderful think tanks about how to reform the tax code.
0.0	0.302492004611	Now, on that tariff -- here's what I'm saying, China -- they send their goods and we don't tax it -- they do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.268764402188	And somebody like a Trump comes along and says, "I know the answers.
0.0	0.346208857704	If we're going to have a coalition, we're going to have to have a coalition not just of people in the western part of the world, our European allies, but we need the Saudis, we need the Egyptians, we need the Jordanians, we need the Gulf states.
0.0	0.355472744458	We should use the debt ceiling, as precisely to Don, to force upon them budgetary reforms.
0.0	0.339684767251	We need to break the Washington cartel, and the only way to do it is to end all the subsidies and all...
0.0	0.316544728825	And I also know that -- and I'm glad to see this -- Senator Sanders has really moved in face of the facts about what we're confronting in our country.
0.0	0.443754489439	Under my plan, no business, big or small, will pay more than 25 percent flat rate on their business income.
0.0	0.327808448782	It's one of the biggest problems our country has.
0.0	0.264545180987	What we need to do is destroy ISIS.
1.0	0.978459525386	As I understand it, the African-American community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse.
0.0	0.379070343303	Some do, but many Americans are dying to have an opportunity to grow and to create something inside this economy.
0.0	0.227969762226	I lead the opposition against it.
0.0	0.209863113159	But actually I am.
0.0	0.308848783921	And then the Government steps in to try and solve the problem and we get a little further down to that progressive vision that Hillary Clinton is talking about.
0.0	0.116019967259	I think he is right.
0.0	0.205328969669	It did not come from our Judeo-Christian roots, I can tell you that.
0.0	0.655890543212	She did.
0.0	0.24037449528	And when our staffers said, "whoa, what's going here?"
0.0	0.329861028381	This is a grassroots campaign and, you know, when I ran for senate in Texas, I told the people of Texas that I'm not going there to go along to get along.
0.0	0.232849563293	Well I think a lot of people are understandably reacting out of fear and anxiety about what they're seeing.
0.0	0.517065073452	CLINTON: Judy, I think that the best analysis that I've seen based on Senator Sanders plans is that it would probably increase the size of the federal government by about 40%, but what is most concerning to me is that in looking at the plans -- let's take healthcare for example.
0.0	0.225085145806	We're going to save Social Security, and we're going to save Medicare.
0.0	0.300282092509	President Obama's policing commission came out with some.
0.0	0.511703422222	And we have to support Sunni-Arab and Kurdish forces against ISIS, because I believe it would be not only a strategic mistake for the United States to put ground combat troops in, as opposed to special operators, as opposed to trainers, because that is exactly what ISIS wants.
0.0	0.212906090908	I think that is the real key here.
0.0	0.554396767885	Our wages are growing faster than the national average, and I've cut taxes more than any sitting governor in this state -- $5 billion, including no taxes on small business and killing the death tax.
0.0	0.440876785959	We'd rebuild infrastructure that would also create jobs in this country, and we'd work with the states to do it the right way, to do it more efficiently and more effectively.
0.0	0.336984720016	Judy, one area very briefly...
0.0	0.3565325914	And I'll note that California senator -- Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said, if she could say to Mr. America and Mrs. America, "give me your guns, I'm rounding them up," she would.
0.0	0.203978292271	And so, when we look at these complex problems, I wish it could be either/or.
0.0	0.366778947632	Well, let me first describe Iran because they're not just a normal nation state.
0.0	0.267959841528	First off, we can do all the great speeches we want but you're not going to succeed unless there is a consensus.
0.0	0.225809553645	They are trying to attack us here in America.
0.0	0.10224362355	So I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.264500637446	So the federal solution would be the Life at Conception act which is an act that would federalize the issue.
0.0	0.301812023653	That can be done without profiling people.
0.0	0.250124045628	The number of women --
0.0	0.216470910452	It worked for Reagan and it works for our team in Ohio.
0.0	0.145120565482	We overcame all of the crowds that were coming down there.
1.0	0.20019832404	They're bringing drugs.
0.0	0.136789653028	This is a remarkable and horrifying fact.
0.0	0.273342687103	My 750,000 donors have contributed more than a million and a half donations.
0.0	0.3291255463	ISIS has now attacked a western democracy in -- in France.
0.0	0.655890543212	Do it.
0.0	0.160839953698	You want to know what carpet bombing is?
0.0	0.314986994537	And people at home are saying they've got a problem, listen to them.
0.0	0.0704347845628	He sure did.
0.0	0.379635219643	You know, Obama has presented the American people with a false choice every time.
1.0	0.30830468282	It allows President Obama to borrow unlimited amounts of money.
0.0	0.173825608263	We have been talking about it for decades.
0.0	0.2881595824	I know we can do this because we're still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.296555695276	I will spend every ounce of energy to stop it.
0.0	0.415046819569	It increases the per child tax credit, because I didn't read about this in a book.
0.0	0.150677482244	I think -- I'm not going to say that everybody is in agreement.
0.0	0.318923271129	Because we have to stop doing things for some people, but for this country, it's destroying our country.
0.0	0.0532351401993	That's the difference.
0.0	0.655890543212	No, I have not.
0.0	0.380927322586	The Iranians getting more of a presence in Syria, linking with Hezbollah, their proxy in Lebanon, would threaten Israel and would make it more difficult for us to move on a path to have a transition that at some point would deal with Assad's future.
0.0	0.204137658343	... the fact is, Neil, let's think about -- let's think about -- and I want to maybe -- I hope the president is watching tonight, because here's what I'd like to tell him.
0.0	0.306609459179	... the mandates and have a simple flat tax.
0.0	0.314608204257	I want to speak to all our fighting men and women.

0.0	0.208000442851	Bret, we're just starting.
0.0	0.0664495800428	Our symbol is the Statue of Liberty.
0.0	0.452468306198	But I also understand, when a law enforcement official charged with the responsibility of preventing attacks -- to go back to our early questions, how do we prevent attacks -- well, if we can't know what someone is planning, we are going to have to rely on the neighbor or, you know, the member of the mosque or the teacher, somebody to see something.
0.0	0.124913608674	And I would not support those.
0.0	0.171754863763	They're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.29451106134	But at the end of the day, no doubt, the Affordable Care Act is a step forward.
0.0	0.181358115801	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.244172056859	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
1.0	0.294964993328	I think we need to stop taking our advice from economists on Wall Street...
0.0	0.297414467922	Terrorism is on the run, China, Russia is advancing their agenda at warp speed, and we pull back.
0.0	0.229448829936	And we need to make that very clear to everybody.
0.0	0.138541065146	But when you're a governor, you have to admit it.
0.0	0.0496172506562	A step forward.
0.0	0.378424341565	But, here is a pledge I've made throughout this campaign, and it's really not a very radical pledge.
0.0	0.244968326709	I've got the backbone, I've got the band width, I've got the experience to get us through this.
0.0	0.350897201214	You have gotten a whole lot of money over the years from Wall Street.
0.0	0.365521728601	I didn't get a phone call from Bill Clinton before I jumped in the race.
0.0	0.375723452965	And so, now that, I think, you know, we have resolved your data, we have agreed on an independent inquiry, we should move on.
0.0	0.443871596276	For example, talking about polls, a poll recently came out, overwhelming majority of the American people say we should strengthen the instant background check.
0.0	0.297566121461	Folks, we have a problem here with the leadership in Washington, but I'll tell you another problem.
0.0	0.252022446077	I'll bring back our jobs, and I'll bring back our money.
0.0	0.401649975083	Do you remember when he ran for president of the United States, and he was a candidate, and he went and said, "These Americans with traditional values, they are bitter people, and they cling to their guns and to their religion."
0.0	0.101163510034	I said no.
1.0	0.315475067855	They just built a hotel in Syria.

0.0	0.280512936421	Obama broke every rule of negotiation.
0.0	0.265465628451	I think the times are different now.
0.0	0.184371810886	So I'm going to keep making that case.
0.0	0.275965295428	Because of all the federal mandates and federal laws, it was too expensive.
0.0	0.391413141438	The question always is, what works better, the private marketplace or government?
0.0	0.445306148656	If we elect Hillary Clinton, the next four years will be worse than the last eight, and our children will be the first Americans ever to inherit a diminished country.
0.0	0.327499085321	We need to take a new approach of taxing -- reforming how we tax, and reforming the regulations in our -- in our country before it's too late.
0.0	0.455475973657	John, I don't think that there is a crisis at the state or local level that really you can point to and say, therefore, I am prepared for the sort of crises that any man or woman who is commander in chief of our country has to deal with.
0.0	0.215012573165	And I agree with Senator Sanders on that.
0.0	0.338152002501	We put in place mandatory work fair (ph).
0.0	0.373924998537	I will deliver for the American people if I have the privilege of leading this country.
0.0	0.243118195109	I was ready to lead, but I wasn't ready to run.
0.0	0.0775243260378	We can do that.
0.0	0.180711962062	I know the bad ones.
0.0	0.409029044372	In many ways, a college degree today is equivalent to what a high school degree was 50, 60 years ago.
0.0	0.00430451372677	Thank you.
0.0	0.25492777409	My mother's dream -- and she died very young, but my mother's dream for her whole life was to be able to get out of that rent-controlled apartment and own a home of her own.
1.0	0.963419791162	Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan.
0.0	0.377486796598	Our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.121461673657	I think it's a two-pronged issue.
0.0	0.655890543212	No.
0.0	0.471299844383	You know, it's -- it's a fact that if you can pay for a $79 one-way ticket to Orlando, and you can escape the challenges of a declining economy and high crime rates, you move to Orlando.
0.0	0.305499553453	And I went to one of these Turkish refugee camps right on the border of Syria.
0.0	0.169804871432	You've got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.272509195677	So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.0966665490188	They will -- some will follow.
0.0	0.266174133742	But probably that was the most challenging because there was no certainty attached to it.
0.0	0.089265855907	It's real estate.
0.0	0.131370201086	But Secretary Clinton is wrong.
0.0	0.0546606228292	Bill.
0.0	0.424872284732	And I would hope in the midst of all of this discussion, this country makes certain that we do not turn our backs on the men and women who put their lives on the line to defend us, and that we stand with them as they have stood with us.
0.0	0.179266080367	That is not protected religious belief.

0.0	0.260833290787	We have to come together as a country.
0.0	0.3884301487	But yes, there is more collaboration required between private sector companies and the public sector.
0.0	0.248578868725	And let me say this also.
0.0	0.356475637886	Good company.... one of the early things I would do, probably before I even got in -- and I wouldn't even use -- you know, I have -- I know the smartest negotiators in the world.
0.0	0.0986123728156	Hillary Clinton cannot be president.
0.0	0.21459116256	I would invite him, I actually would say.
0.0	0.401573025316	You find a Democrat that's for cutting taxes -- cutting spending ten dollars, I'll give them a warm kiss.
0.0	0.242533254835	And I'll allow putting that tariff or whatever he's saying here...
0.0	0.299940690727	You know, I've never really brought this up unless asked the question, but I have responded to the question.
0.0	0.273934225843	We need to get a bipartisan commitment to work together on this.
0.0	0.0384079409917	Martha, thank you.
0.0	0.159219877747	Well, thanks for having me.
0.0	0.381429121143	No, I oppose it because you're taking money from the entitlement and then spending it immediately on other items.
0.0	0.421102946166	Marco stood today, standing on this stage Marco supports legalization and citizenship for 12 million illegals.
0.0	0.371542628806	The increasing globalization without any real safety valve for people to have a better life.
0.0	0.44488223392	We have to end crony capitalism in Washington, where the lobbyists and the powerful can get tax breaks and tax credits, and the American people don't get laws in their interest.
0.0	0.275840670984	He's been a good governor, and he's a heck of a lot better than his predecessor that would have bankrupted New Jersey.
0.0	0.222960072342	The problem is we never get it done.
0.0	0.271607409208	Because I think we have to get to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.35180413153	I do believe that people who are trying to come to the United States -- this country has a right to know who they are and why they are coming.
0.0	0.479510227259	And I'm going to tell you this, we need to use the benefit of our law enforcement people across this country, combined with our intelligence people across this country.
0.0	0.413632831122	But the truth of the matter is, if we want wages to go up, we've got to get 11 million of our neighbors out of off the book shadow economy, and into the full light of an American economy.
0.0	0.165731247039	I'm asking you for your vote.
0.0	0.131647118571	This was a question on entitlements.
0.0	0.302331708247	Good question, but I want to tell you, my great concern is that we are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job.
0.0	0.655890543212	Why?
0.0	0.120342608695	...Then I'll buy you a tequila...

0.0	0.510119490872	What this campaign is not only about electing someone who has the most progressive agenda, it is about bringing tens of millions of people together to demand that we have a government that represents all of us and not just the 1 percent, who today have so much economic and political power.
0.0	0.219032375281	Look, this is a tragedy for New Hampshire.
0.0	0.402839453039	This president has failed, and when I'm in the Oval Office, police officers will know that they will have the support of the president of the Untied States.
0.0	0.320476066465	I have a way to pay for it that actually makes the wealthiest pay for it...
0.0	0.252516325747	I find -- I mean, it's just a very different, you know, historical perspective here.
0.0	0.198892617688	I know that because I buy the product."
0.0	0.411074025331	And that would I think give the American public a bit more of a sense of security about who is being processed and who might end up coming as refugees.
0.0	0.394364375159	My heart, like all of us in this room, John, and all the people across our country, my hearts go out to the people of France in this moment of loss.

0.0	0.337474879126	Maybe we should focus on quality education with well-paid faculty members.
0.0	0.472357486891	Well, first of all, we're running a $2 billion dollar surplus, we're not having a revenue problem right now.
0.0	0.319467463008	Hillary Clinton stored classified information on her private server.
0.0	0.310670929915	And I think the reason he did is because immigration is sort of an example of what's broken and what's wrong in Washington, D..C.
0.0	0.23890781116	And they consorted with Barack Obama to steal from Social Security.
0.0	0.333982393522	I think it's a big thing that our party needs to be part of, and I've been a leader in Congress on trying to bring about criminal justice reform.

0.0	0.29639673281	I chaired the National Commission on Homeland Security Committee for United States.
0.0	0.433779903016	And that's how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America.
0.0	0.16580546637	It's virtually useless.
0.0	0.31971783794	The rate -- the rate -- the rate is gonna be much closer to 15 percent.
0.0	0.303817337358	They should be able to walk in the door tomorrow and get a variety of treatments that work for them.

0.0	0.415007858526	If you believe that our country's problems and the threats that we face in this world can only be met with new thinking, new and fresh approaches, then I ask you to join my campaign.
0.0	0.108982538506	We need that thinking.
0.0	0.167948616537	They wouldn't be there except for us.
0.0	0.0869059478512	That's not right.
0.0	0.33998659635	Come on, that's just not -- you scare senior citizens with that.
0.0	0.198832766631	We have to get the remaining 10.
0.0	0.355725580315	It came out recently they have equipment that is 30 years old.
0.0	0.336096424137	And where we are right now is we have got to stand up to the Trumps of the world who are trying to divide us up.
0.0	0.263305720561	And that's the way my parents came legally in 1956.
0.0	0.137608570815	I want to be in -- I want America to be the best...
0.0	0.116229165433	And we should be a welcoming nation.

0.0	0.339822184453	Because I think if you only think about the coalition abroad you're missing the main point, which is we need a coalition here at home.
0.0	0.311023994908	If it's not me in the position, it's one of these politicians that we're running against, you know, the 400 people that we're (inaudible).

0.0	0.0900562161669	But I want to go further.
0.0	0.39346532333	We now have some good models about how better to provide employment, housing and education.
1.0	0.953611615146	And the reason I said that is because the FBI director told the American people, told Congress, that he could not guarantee he could vet them and it would be safe.
0.0	0.277087817675	We called Ben, he was with me 100%.
0.0	0.198881193091	We're going to create a border.

0.0	0.168677191331	Government is the enemy.
0.0	0.1959213238	But look, we didn't know what was happening next.
0.0	0.228522767356	And the last piece is this.
0.0	0.310005748237	It's poor people and middle class.
0.0	0.278565831334	It has too much economic power.
0.0	0.455009672903	Well, first of all, under President Jeb Bush, we would restore the strength of the military.
0.0	0.365967010711	This is a part of the world where the United States has tried to play two different approaches.
0.0	0.0332986378527	Alright.

0.0	0.387286352712	Our labor participation rate was the worst since 1978.
0.0	0.344580117834	And, you know, I do think it's important to do exactly what Senator Sanders said, and that is to start talking about the issues that the American people really care about, and that they talk to each of us about.
0.0	0.445721613903	I think we need major reform in the military, making it more cost effective, but also focusing on the real crisis that faces us.
0.0	0.655890543212	...
0.0	0.216702544655	So, I represented New York, and I represented New York on 9/11 when we were attacked.

0.0	0.455586968184	And second, the First Amendment Defense Act, which is protecting religious liberty, if it's not passed by then, which I suspect it won't, because the president will veto it, I will institute an executive order to make sure that people of faith are not being -- not being harassed and persecuted by the federal government for standing up for the religious beliefs.

0.0	0.266215791069	We need to embed with -- with the Iraqi military.

0.0	0.085920970374	Yes.
0.0	0.427684045628	Yes, I believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on Wall Street, that they are a Wall Street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession -- Great Depression.
0.0	0.0783325839971	And here's what's going to happen.
0.0	0.365710148231	Let me tell you that, in this country -- in this country, people are concerned about their economic future.
0.0	0.116645204721	Look, here is the reality, folks.
0.0	0.26395084376	We have to provide financial support to them.
0.0	0.337524736276	Yes, they have to stop trying to destabilize the Middle East, causing even more chaos.
0.0	0.137705441782	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.195181590293	And it's not just a question for parents and grandparents to answer.
0.0	0.384204575005	Look, we are fighting for every vote that we can get from women, from men, straight, gay, African-Americans, Latinos, Asian-Americans.
0.0	0.297465371938	Well, Maria, I'm glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what's going on in the world.
0.0	0.24504401707	I think it's a wonderful that that businesses start a 401(k).
0.0	0.185680673004	We will win on everything we do.
0.0	0.390430465708	We're going to have a three-bracket tax code, 10, 15 and 25 percent.
0.0	0.091264715746	We saw it in the blimp.
0.0	0.158460547419	Now, it's very interesting.
0.0	0.387536127025	Our country deserves no less, because all of the other issues we want to deal with depend upon us being secure and strong.
0.0	0.228516326452	Never been done before, never been done since.
0.0	0.350798594059	But I'm not worried about my finances, I'm worried about the finances of everyday Americans who today are struggling in an economy that is not producing good paying jobs while everything else costs more.
0.0	0.430203815508	But accommodating 65,000 refugees in our country today, people of 320 million, is akin to making room for 6.5 more people in a baseball stadium with 32,000.
0.0	0.309116465812	And we need to do that throughout the country.
0.0	0.408558630888	They want American soldiers on the ground fighting them, giving them many more targets, and giving them a great recruiting opportunity.
0.0	0.236429520734	And I make a lot more than the average American.
0.0	0.0775243260378	And we can do it.
0.0	0.435727479136	And for my part, I have demonstrated the ability to have the backbone to take on Wall Street in ways that Secretary Clinton never, ever has.
0.0	0.238019989564	You know why three?
0.0	0.201260707707	The government has lied to you and they have stolen from you.
0.0	0.0168182296393	So did you, Marco.
0.0	0.389876227114	It was a company that had grown into a bloated, inept bureaucracy that cost too much and delivered too little to customers and shareholders.
0.0	0.38911867585	We've got Social Security that's going to be destroyed if somebody like me doesn't bring money into the country.
0.0	0.265513893617	You also have to get rid of all the deductions and all the loopholes.
0.0	0.247739954055	Now we're having smaller families.
0.0	0.25370232929	Give people a chance.
0.0	0.265666588719	So you know the New York Times and I don't have exactly have the warmest of relationships.
0.0	0.315552749588	Well, look, I believe that we've made great progress as a country with the Affordable Care Act.
0.0	0.395456770444	We both believe there has to be more money going into the Social Security system.
0.0	0.00430451372677	Thank you.
0.0	0.229404462687	And they came back with 23 recommendations.
0.0	0.193919490809	Nobody can do that like me.
0.0	0.40111616755	And we have to cut off the flow of foreign funding and foreign fighters.
0.0	0.518495672545	I wanna tell you, in my state, we took Medicaid, the hardest program to control, and we took it from a 10 percent growth rate to 2.5 percent without taking one person off the rolls or cutting one single benefit.
0.0	0.211493075246	It's not the evil rich people.
0.0	0.281396403118	America is best when we work in collaboration with our allies.
0.0	0.268389650933	I know we have a president who wants to do whatever he wants to do, and take his pen and his phone and just tell everybody what he thinks is best.
0.0	0.37959948019	But those Muslim countries are going to have to lead the effort.
0.0	0.33949355549	... the fact is -- the fact is the reason why that no one wants to answer entitlements up here is because it's hard.
0.0	0.308008893938	Caucus for me on Monday night because if I am your nominee, I will unite this party and I will defeat Hillary Clinton and when I'm president, America's light will shine again and the 21 century will be a new American century.
0.0	0.128059054644	We're up 400,000 jobs.
0.0	0.363978201261	And the fact of the matter is if we give them a mission and we don't tie their hands behind their back, they can get it accomplished.
0.0	0.0595908644227	In addition to that...
0.0	0.229683309892	You know, I want to go back for a moment to what we were just talking about.
0.0	0.149242678519	Mark my words.
0.0	0.318884016251	And now they are beating us economically.
0.0	0.295927859116	And with respect to my own husband, I am probably still going to pick the flowers and the china for state dinners and stuff like that.
0.0	0.353637321793	People have been paying it for years.
0.0	0.257037135269	But the real -- but I think we have to get back to what this election has to be about.
0.0	0.255130592467	But the reason America is a great country, the reason is because our compassion is in our laws.
0.0	0.138427672607	The most mistreated people.
0.0	0.290943074509	We have gutted our ability to detect the next attack.
0.0	0.128752344567	He's weak on immigration.
0.0	0.327855014072	We ought to be working to improve it and prevent Republicans from both underming it and even repealing it.
0.0	0.304663740971	I have so many Web sites, I have them all over the place.
1.0	0.975689552662	Barack Obama actually had the poison pill to stop it then.
0.0	0.349456387987	And the reason for that is we've got to deal with the elephant in the room, which is the greed, recklessness and illegal behavior on Wall Street.
0.0	0.296957739292	We need to end minimal sentencing.
0.0	0.0918526055885	He didn't know.
0.0	0.464386645083	Somebody who, yes, votes right, but much more than that, leads the efforts to protect the hard-fought gains that women have made, that, make no mistake about it, are under tremendous attack, not just by the Republican presidential candidates but by a whole national effort to try to set back women's rights.
0.0	0.293935218735	You see something that's suspicious, you call law enforcement and let law enforcement make those decisions.
0.0	0.329455845244	And in fact, in Obama administration, we did not meet with anybody without conditions.
0.0	0.305398559711	You know, you had Herbert Hoover before that saying, no, we got to only worry about the deficit.
0.0	0.148983766703	That was not, as I understand it, the secretary's position.
0.0	0.491966450951	But if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things, including corporate taxes, and including the capital gains taxes, you make that amount up pretty quickly.
0.0	0.200726457374	And you combine that with reforms of our welfare system.
0.0	0.0517874089761	I introduced...
0.0	0.393655717665	If we were to expand Medicaid, for every uninsured person we would cover, we'd kick more than one person out of private insurance or remove their opportunity to get private insurance.
0.0	0.375593969307	Let us actually go to zero- based budgeting so we know where the money is being spent.
0.0	0.44543674227	And in that capacity, I met with just an extraordinary group of people from World War II, from korea, vietnam, all of the wars.
0.0	0.341684399215	So we always have to balance liberty and security, privacy and safety, but I know that law enforcement needs the tools to keep us safe.
0.0	0.366007812819	In fact, after it happened, the president called my husband -- he called all the former presidents and he said to Bill, "Well I assume Hillary has told you about this."
1.0	0.986082634598	You used to support a 500 percent increase in the number of guest workers, now you say that you're against it.
0.0	0.273468275168	No, I've never made a promise like that.
0.0	0.445935550217	About every two weeks, he holds a press conference talking about how he can't wait to restrict people's access to guns.
0.0	0.259221579337	You know, all of these politicians that I'm running against now -- it's so nice to say I'm running as opposed to if I run, if I run.
0.0	0.298421008468	That's the kind of leadership this country needs.
0.0	0.394341381732	And I took on the drug companies and I took on the insurance companies to try to get us universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.408304306884	Well, why do they make millions of dollars of campaign contributions?
0.0	0.516721309243	Last week in a CNN town hall, the Senator told a questioner that the questioner would spend about $500 dollars in taxes to get about $5,000 dollars in healthcare.
0.0	0.153340379322	I know, Bret.
0.0	0.413291434553	A law has been sitting -- languishing, sadly, on Capitol Hill and has not yet been passed, and it would help.
0.0	0.167419544958	And until that happens there's not going to be consensus on this issue.
0.0	0.29795140558	And strengthen our military and take care of our vets.
0.0	0.376519221459	... president of the United States has got to do, and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility, is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe.
0.0	0.0850114441971	They don't believe in any of that.
0.0	0.25458286875	And let me make a final point on this.
0.0	0.413565753171	Ultimately, we have got to say as a nation, Secretary Clinton, is health care a right of all people or is it not?
0.0	0.303756206182	... you had two 110-story buildings come crashing down.
0.0	0.0482873516562	It's what they call it.
0.0	0.184049404274	There's a big question mark on your head.
0.0	0.447982681279	And we need to be focused and lift the rules of engagement so we're not sending our fighting men and women into combat with their arms tied behind their backs.
0.0	0.313342417886	The idea of 401(k)s. I have a small business that I set up.
0.0	0.0745453942142	And you know what?
0.0	0.342403913079	We're not going to fix what ails our economy, we're not going to make wages go up for everyone by either trying to replace American capitalism with socialism -- which, by the way, the rest of the world is moving away from -- nor will we fix it by submitting to sort of Wall Street-directed crony capitalism.
0.0	0.213538435326	to save a company.
0.0	0.217753642046	Here's the thing that I would ask Donald Trump in all seriousness.
0.0	0.0754890776484	The Syrians should stay in Syria.
0.0	0.5	And, Jim, you know full well that in the seven years I was U.S. attorney we went after pharmaceutical companies.
0.0	0.23326592633	The only way we're going to defund Planned Parenthood is have a pro-life president.
0.0	0.365237216517	You didn't see these kind of ideas being batted around, and being batted around in a way that's civil and smart and that's trying to help to inform the voter out there.
0.0	0.329739515342	But the bottom line is we must have virtue, we must have a religious bearing as a nation.
0.0	0.386271059186	You know, the annual Medicare budget is over $600 billion.
0.0	0.207416752371	And they wonder whether somebody is getting something to -- keeping them from getting it.
0.0	0.196170561353	Good luck making something out of this mess."
0.0	0.361618381775	Well, I wish you would have asked that question years ago when they broke it.
0.0	0.0975465936037	And who's compromised and who is principled.
0.0	0.253729115268	He was unable to answer the question, is Iraq a good thing or bad thing?
0.0	0.197309433385	Ask Boeing.
0.0	0.106684970232	So there might be an occasion if we did overturn Roe v. Wade -- Roe v. Wade nationalized the issue.
0.0	0.169125360152	And that's why Ronald Reagan said that it was a blindfold.
0.0	0.0983023143776	Oh, I'll talk about that, too.
0.0	0.400128752541	We have 30,000 fewer state bureaucrats than the day I took office.
0.0	0.321978278003	But without the tools, without the support that was needed to that.
0.0	0.255094365824	You can get it at $2.99 on Amazon.
0.0	0.204626455234	I'm going to support you, and I think that is absolutely appropriate.
0.0	0.655890543212	Not at all.
0.0	0.179823423549	China doesn't pay the tariff, the buyer pays the tariff.
0.0	0.283622088154	This is why, fundamentally, we have to take our government back.
0.0	0.395595719919	That will create a true 50-state national marketplace which will drive down the cost of low-cost, catastrophic health insurance.
0.0	0.381488167228	Now, in fact, what we have got to do -- and I think there is widespread agreement here -- is the United States cannot do it alone.
0.0	0.194840847433	I couldn't have said it better myself.
0.0	0.340373448311	When that battle was waged, my friend Senator Rubio chose to stand with Barack Obama and Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer and support amnesty.
0.0	0.449622706529	Half of American seniors would be in poverty without a Social Security check.
0.0	0.392446863576	But they all said, a lot of the pundits on television, "Well, Donald will never run, and one of the main reasons is he's private and he's probably not as successful as everybody thinks."
0.0	0.292648111784	We have to go after price gouging and monopolistic practices and get Medicare the authority to negotiate.
0.0	0.277604592694	America is best when we are actually standing up to evil in this world.
0.0	0.194695163124	Well, yes, indeed.
0.0	0.389340274635	... you know, the -- the -- the fact of the matter is -- you know, if we fix the taxation system, make it absolutely fair, and get rid of the incredible regulations -- because every regulation is a tax, it's a -- on goods and services.
0.0	0.179388747097	And they're going to tell us where the terrorists are.
0.0	0.313315608443	We also have to build a coalition at home.
0.0	0.252719283773	Support community banks and credit unions.
0.0	0.253671822985	Then he'll call all sorts of political people, and I'll say, "Sorry, fellas.
0.0	0.167592142908	But the president leads in this regard.
0.0	0.655890543212	No.
0.0	0.417777536492	You joined the Senate in voting to get rid of Gadhafi, and you asked that there be a Security Council validation of that with a resolution.
0.0	0.36223598431	The second thing I said is we need to add reforms, not just increase the numbers, but add reforms.
0.0	0.279591684423	I'm joined tonight by two daughters, Tara and Grace.
0.0	0.185540257127	That is a pledge that I'm making.
1.0	0.337144572374	2,300 sophisticated vehicles, they ran, and the enemy took them.
0.0	0.33557685232	You can trust me to do the following: that when I get on change with Hillary Clinton, we won't be debating about the science, we'll be debating about the solutions.
0.0	0.118652446368	It's going in and that's going to be it, going into Tennessee.
1.0	0.989076587272	Who denies that African-American youth unemployment, real, is over 50 percent.
0.0	0.276708441507	No interest," because I don't need anybody's money.
0.0	0.194284845278	We got nothing but problems.
0.0	0.252163360625	We're going to make a really dynamic economy from what we have right now, which is not at all dynamic.
0.0	0.293069539081	We can take many of those same procedures, we can apply it to Medicare.
0.0	0.322973926879	Because part of this is the startup challenges that this system is facing.
0.0	0.319863106029	Yeah.  TRUMP R 15 75 0 N So I finally got it over there and they charged me a big tariff.  TRUMP R 15 75 1 N They're not supposed to be doing that.  TRUMP R 15 75 2 N I told them.
0.0	0.250007203021	You're not going to hear a lot of polished political speech from me, but you will hear the truth.
0.0	0.335872821858	And as far as the Syrians are concerned, Al-Hasakah province, perfect place.
0.0	0.195553390667	And I would not stand for that as president of the United States.
0.0	0.39890718638	And in 19 -- and I will tell you this, and I said it very strongly, years ago, I said -- and I love the military, and I want to have the strongest military that we've ever had, and we need it more now than ever.
0.0	0.285995134031	But I would want to agree with something that Senator Sanders says.
0.0	0.346148058974	There are too many opioids being prescribed, and that leads directly now to heroin addiction.
0.0	0.391572713739	I agree, however, it doesn't go far enough, because what it focuses on are the big banks, which Senator Sanders has talked about a lot, for good reason.
0.0	0.315139355956	I hire people, they do a Web site.
0.0	0.214917115811	They issue two-thirds of the credit cards and one-third of the mortgages.
0.0	0.08713968294	I think there is a consensus.
0.0	0.240062690561	It's fine if they come in, but they have to come in legally.
0.0	0.260754904338	We've got the consensus, what we're lacking is political leadership...
0.0	0.655890543212	No.
0.0	0.171696244291	A lot of interesting issues have come together.
0.0	0.257164494468	And if we can do that in Texas, that 12th largest economy in the world, we can do it in America.
0.0	0.655890543212	No.
0.0	0.473055900157	You know, in recent travels around this country, I've encountered so many Americans who are discouraged and angry as they watch our freedom, our security and the American dream slipping away under an unresponsive government that is populated by bureaucrats and special interest groups.
0.0	0.351399896371	So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives.
0.0	0.303990844426	But like all of our problems, there isn't a single one that can't be solved with common sense if you remove the ego and the politics.
0.0	0.409448376311	I think it's great that Senator Sanders, President Obama and I have more donors than any three people who have every run, certainly on the Democratic side.
0.0	0.353027409027	If we -- if we don't act now, we are going to be the first generation in American history that leaves our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.210028642502	Or would you rather take less later on?
0.0	0.47162784981	They built it in about one year, this massive military port.
0.0	0.129879742693	You know, I am by my nature impatient.
0.0	0.129390142501	Take it from your professors...
0.0	0.384838768124	It's their time to bail out the middle class, help our kids be able to go to college tuition-free.
0.0	0.346213615064	Before you get to that, though, Puerto Rico is going to have to deal with the structural problems they face.
0.0	0.132582227738	I have a problem with that, Martha.
0.0	0.42037385371	And the fact is those jobs are critical, they're hard working members of the middle class and they need to be paid attention to because they're Americans and they carry the load.
0.0	0.224320227681	It's like a tariff, but here's the difference: if we impose a tariff, China responds.
0.0	0.0172523048492	But I was born here.
0.0	0.295738972242	I'm not talking about now, I'm talking about in the future they're building massive plants in China because China does not want Boeing building their planes here, they want them built in China, because China happens to be smart the way they do it, not the way we do it.
0.0	0.356417528265	... and I think -- you know, Governor -- Jeb, you -- the attack that -- the authorization that Barack Obama asked for was not against ISIS.
0.0	0.292856837313	Now, let me ask you a question everybody, and, this is for the guy, you know, who owns a landscaping business out there.
0.0	0.281815081364	There's never going do be perfect bill.
0.0	0.372251621978	Yes, well, roughly.
0.0	0.345936641444	I released 34 years of tax returns...
0.0	0.11002285396	We have made it easier to do that, not harder.
0.0	0.386344077022	Second of all, and the reason I believe in a health care for all program, we need to understand that addiction is a disease, not a criminal activity.
0.0	0.188970018252	We have people that are morally corrupt.
0.0	0.302187469494	And the world, no doubt is a better place without him.
0.0	0.143662952612	... Chris, keep it coming...
0.0	0.20265750315	We need to deal with ISIS in the caliphate.
0.0	0.128536336835	He's a major Hillary Clinton supporter.
0.0	0.286113265508	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.289998891163	Let's put the gun makers and sellers on notice that they're not going to get away with it.
0.0	0.25658083604	That's what I understand is the request from the international...
0.0	0.266678081225	By the way, speaking of my family, Melania, Barron, Kai, Donnie, Don, Vanessa, Tiffany, Evanka did a great job.
0.0	0.197912226351	Yes, they've got to get out of Syria.
0.0	0.0525582663573	That's American capitalism.
0.0	0.0636243880176	I don't have a super PAC.
0.0	0.363475094155	We have to lead a coalition that will take back territory from ISIS.
0.0	0.482721528822	And just like Social Security and unlike the Republicans, I think we should actually expand Social Security and increase average monthly benefits.
1.0	0.509714838328	Not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama and the big government economy, the median wage for women has dropped $733.
0.0	0.058827185902	They don't have a clue.
0.0	0.156972925774	I kind of miss Donald Trump.
0.0	0.321763759566	And then we need to shut down -- we need to shut down their mechanisms of funding and attack their command-and-control centers.
0.0	0.0933301540182	They go to Harvard.
0.0	0.0986502454718	And who can blame them?
0.0	0.491415786326	I believe that we need to cut these taxes down, we need to be on a roadmap to balancing the budget, and we need to send power, money, and influence, the welfare department, the education department, job training, infrastructure, Medicaid, all of that out of Washington back to the states so we can run these programs from where we live to the top, not a one size fits all mentality that they have in Washington.
0.0	0.203588270243	Libya is now a mess.
0.0	0.278137114517	That will never happen when I am president of the United States.
0.0	0.303235432115	If I was a Puerto Rican, I'd vote for statehood so that they have full citizenship.
0.0	0.386788826692	The fact of the matter is he doesn't realize that we now live in the 21st century, and that war is very different than it used to be before.
0.0	0.312390140876	This is the unholy alliance that people need to know about between right and left.
0.0	0.302394540311	As far as the polls are concerned, Iowa, on Monday night you're going to go to a caucus site and you'll be the first Americans that vote in this election.
0.0	0.274056068366	And that's why they have it in Europe, because it is a way to blindfolded the people, that's what Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.524173086528	In my own state, after the children in that Connecticut classroom were gunned down, we passed comprehensive gun safety legislation with background checks, ban on assault weapons, and Senator, I think we do need to repeal that immunity that you granted to the gun industry.
0.0	0.30170158294	It was 25 years ago, and I came by defeating the Democratic incumbent.
0.0	0.0359773926074	I agree with them.
0.0	0.155584361247	That can be done.
0.0	0.103199080568	All of these are very difficult issues.
0.0	0.204033418523	And the problem today is there's no confidence in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.422770385001	It is very clear there will be no progress on this issue in any way, shape or form, until you prove to the people of this country that illegal immigration is under control.
0.0	0.112186605704	I've laid out...
0.0	0.382694436646	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.0201508994259	That's a dictatorship.
0.0	0.00430451372677	Thank you.
0.0	0.417075107871	When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York.
0.0	0.338227526277	People came back from Iraq and Afghanistan without legs, without arms.
0.0	0.406685815755	But the issue for us is to have a Congress that stands up and says not only no, but "Hell no" to this money going to a regime that is going to use it for terror, Susan Rice has said that, and we need to stand up and strongly and clearly tell the ayatollah that -- whoever the next president of the United States is going to be, and I'll promise you, if it's me, the first thing that I will do is tear up that agreement with Iran.
0.0	0.441716308714	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.480957586912	Any connection maybe to the fact that our people pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs?
0.0	0.213694816945	But look at that border with Saudi Arabia.
1.0	0.980256649126	One out of five Americans can't even afford the prescriptions their doctors are writing.
0.0	0.127672581227	There are politics in the boardroom as well.
0.0	0.278391784595	You would say maybe two, maybe four?
0.0	0.404038089588	-- living in extreme poverty is the highest level on record.
0.0	0.299915389858	Every time we send signals like this, we send a signal of weakness, not strength.
0.0	0.219277622845	But bottom line is: The president is right.
0.0	0.411603049708	I deployed the National Guard after I stood on the ramp in Dallas, Texas and looked the president of the United States in the eye and said, "Mr. President, if you won't secure the border, Texas will," and that's exactly what we did.
0.0	0.0454403477276	And that's what we have to contrast.
0.0	0.291270871033	John Kasich, will you insult two people over here?
0.0	0.352012192981	That is what this debate is all about, and I would suggest let's stay focused on those issues -- rather than just attacks directed at each other.
0.0	0.303280038953	That's right, three pages.
0.0	0.467385374364	This is what I think -- this is what many economists believe that one of the reasons that real unemployment in this country is 10 percent, one of the reasons that African American youth unemployment and underemployment is 51 percent is the average worker in America doesn't have any disposable income.
0.0	0.388044675997	... first of all, let me just tell you something -- and you know, because you just saw the numbers yourself -- NBC Wall Street Journal just came out with a poll -- headline: Trump way up, Cruz going down.
0.0	0.329611549053	It is disgraceful, and in a Christie administration, they would know much, much better than to do that.
0.0	0.263725236182	Well, I just want to quickly add...
0.0	0.0414536722995	Absolutely.
0.0	0.257368612041	They're sending us not the right people.
0.0	0.4507507686	First, we should pass the Expatriate Terrorist Act, legislation I've introduced that says if an American goes and joins ISIS and wages jihad against America, that you forfeit your citizenship and you can not come in on a passport.
0.0	0.146940547095	When did we beat Japan at anything?
0.0	0.432643069621	Let me just say, if you're talking about an $18 trillion economy, you're talking about a 15 percent tax on your gross domestic product.
0.0	0.357125459637	The way that things work in the modern era is actually to gather people around the table and figure these things out.
0.0	0.26735526426	But I do believe that is a minimum.
0.0	0.39416918401	More importantly, I want kids in Burlington, Vermont, or Baltimore, Maryland, who are in the sixth grade or the eighth grade, who don't have a lot of money, whose parents -- like my parents -- may never have gone to college.
0.0	0.194733744589	You know, I find it really quite fascinating some of the president's proclamations.
0.0	0.426846914968	First, rather than expand benefits for everyone, I do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs.
0.0	0.203978124556	So when somebody like Donald Trump and others...
0.0	0.372480635671	Our government belongs to all of us, and not just the hand full of billionaires.
0.0	0.373725177063	And, there is no one on this stage better prepared to prosecute the case against Hillary Clinton than I am.
0.0	0.205153339383	But I would say this to you, Bret.
0.0	0.156506766953	Chris I was mentioned in that question.
0.0	0.319967358349	And if you listen to what they say -- and I had a chance over those 11 hours to watch and listen, as well as what I see in their debates -- they are putting forth alarming plans.
1.0	0.353188331085	Twenty-one mass shootings, including one last weekend in Des Moins where three were murdered.
0.0	0.0594279453048	As a Catholic, that's what I want to do.
0.0	0.198015451871	Everybody thought it was a done deal.
0.0	0.104104005667	What a brilliant idea that would be.
0.0	0.300348839009	I'm running hard and I believe I'll be the Republican nominee and I'll be the one best suited to beat Hillary Clinton, who should not be president of the United States.
1.0	0.462077408772	$10.10 was all I could get the state to do by the time I left in my last year.
0.0	0.160133728752	Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.397322900418	And when I left, we were stronger, we were safer, and we were more united than at any time in my lifetime.
0.0	0.336958797338	We can make a stronger program.
0.0	0.255069088849	I congratulate Secretary of State John Kerry and the president for working on this agreement.

0.0	0.375514366705	I saw you on the Senate floor flip your vote on crop insurance because they told you it would help you in Iowa, and last week, we all saw you flip your vote on ethanol in Iowa for the same reason.
0.0	0.307821298859	That is like asking the arsonist to come and pour more gas on the fire.
0.0	0.0515945529102	But it will be...

0.0	0.314244354361	Anybody who tells me that we need every penny and every one of those is in a fantasy world.
1.0	0.983740664754	I have more donations from students and teachers than I do from people associated with Wall Street.

0.0	0.352781709186	If I am president of the United States, we're going to send soldiers back to Iraq, back to Syria, to keep us from being attacked here and keep soldiers in Afghanistan because we must.
0.0	0.150080518748	But people have to be alert.
0.0	0.422585320411	We'll have mandatory E-verify, a mandatory entry/exit tracking system and until all of that is in place and all of that is working and we can prove to the people of this country that illegal immigration is under control, nothing else is going to happen.
0.0	0.178513340583	It's a problem all over the world.

0.0	0.242277494657	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.

0.0	0.270357970935	How about talking about the substantive issues the people care about?

0.0	0.394174487794	They attacked us in Philadelphia last week.
0.0	0.408880545389	It seems to me that given our history as a nation that has been a beacon of hope for the oppressed, for the downtrodden, that I very strongly disagree with those Republican candidates who say, you know what, we've got to turn our backs on women and children who left their home with nothing, nothing at all.
0.0	0.521574514061	They've given out $140 million of bonuses to Veterans Department employees, including reducing the waiting lists, without giving veterans care.
0.0	0.110865743439	... he's really doing some bad...
0.0	0.333907113178	I do agree that in particular, Turkey and the Gulf nations have got to make up their minds.
0.0	0.364633705595	So if you're having Medicare for all, single-payer, you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing.
0.0	0.0199668435832	It is why we have to simplify.
0.0	0.299320442729	I've heard a lot about me in this debate, and I'm going to keep talking and thinking about all of you because ultimately, I think the president's job is to do everything possible, everything that she can do to lift up the people of this country.
0.0	0.268413171074	I think he was probably the most honest man in politics that we've ever seen in a generation.
0.0	0.355705606056	So he had to leave the Situation Room after hearing from the small group advising him and he had to make that decision.
0.0	0.32238080325	At the core of that resolution is an agreement I negotiated in June of 2012 in Geneva, which set forth a cease-fire and moving toward a political resolution, trying to bring the parties at stake in Syria together.
0.0	0.403150018854	The fact is what we need is someone on that stage who has been tested, who has been through it, who has made decisions, who has sit (ph) in the chair of consequence and can prosecute the case against Hillary Clinton on...
0.0	0.273616544963	Hillary Clinton has never been responsible for those kind of decisions where they were held accountable.
0.0	0.276970431944	Well, the only thing - the only thing I can go on Senator Sanders...
0.0	0.0107276206506	): Secretary...
0.0	0.226289701718	And I think that's a bad idea for the following reason.
0.0	0.290440651279	I think we're on the verge of the greatest time, and I want to fix the things to let people rise up.
0.0	0.147370200961	You should stick with it and that's exactly what happened.
0.0	0.358935097196	And I agree about the role that he played both in war and in peace on the economy and defeating fascism around the world.
0.0	0.307917643761	And I wanted to add one other thing, John, and I think it's important for all of us on this stage.
0.0	0.1276454771	Well, sure.
0.0	0.246006906801	OK, just so you understand -- I know so much about trading about with China.
0.0	0.44881092362	And that's why I've offered a specific program to the people of America tonight to address the fundamental problem of getting our country growing again, getting our economy growing, wages up, opportunities for people.
0.0	0.235273745159	We expand Medicare to all people.
0.0	0.204798343256	Well, I mean, I was talked about in the question.
0.0	0.244172056859	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.266151170244	I -- I've been for pausing on admitting the Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.466901943215	If my memory is correct, I think when we saw children coming from these horrendous, horrendously violent areas of Honduras and neighboring countries, people who are fleeing drug violence and cartel violence, I thought it was a good idea to allow those children to stay in this country.
0.0	0.334120711579	You come to back to this country and you have LAX, disaster.
0.0	0.404993460801	What I am very happy in this campaign that we have had rallies with tens of thousands of people, mostly young people.
0.0	0.186125044773	But what happens if, God forbid, the next Barack Obama takes over, and the next Nancy Pelosi, and the next Harry Reid...
1.0	0.451625196133	But two of our counties actually went to $12.80 and their county executives, if they were here tonight, would also tell you that it works.
0.0	0.424007372965	I have said that we could leave it to the states but I've also introduced a federal solution as well.
0.0	0.134287563967	And, I'll tell you something else.
0.0	0.464950142711	But view is those trade policies have enabled corporate America to shut down in this country, throw millions of people out on the street.
0.0	0.368385433234	Yes, we've lied to the American people about Social Security, and Medicare.
0.0	0.0519754881784	I think you're --
0.0	0.311051099922	And we rebuilt downtown Manhattan, and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved New York and loved New Yorkers.
0.0	0.302765261072	Illegal immigration is beyond belief.
0.0	0.145175145436	So I've watched the politicians.
0.0	0.295460274446	But this cannot be an American fight, although American leadership is essential.
0.0	0.193575060052	Do the $12 and you would index it.
0.0	0.386999165662	I have worked with President Obama for the last seven years.
0.0	0.373090810491	I want those kids to know that if they study hard, they do their homework, regardless of the income of their families, they will in fact be able to get a college education because we are going to make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.144154927156	Of course not.
0.0	0.121492834011	There won't be any -- you can get it.
0.0	0.0967684760577	They do whatever what they do, OK.
0.0	0.261031715829	The big corporations have the scale to deal with all of this.
0.0	0.454854417573	But bottom line now, is in America, in the year 2015, any person who has the ability and the desire should be able to get an education, college education, regardless of the income of his or her family.
0.0	0.242442352629	I did a lot of great deals, and I did them early and young.
0.0	0.482021607391	Just as we require every major department, every county to report its major crimes, we should require police departments to report their discourtesy, brutality, excessive force.
0.0	0.429871202482	At the same time, we know that in many parts of our country police officers are bridging those divides and they're acting heroically.
0.0	0.333998944344	Americans are tired of hearing this debate -- want to go to, what are you going to do about illegal immigration?
0.0	0.0918774390307	That's what the political revolution is about.
0.0	0.276987644446	I watched the video of Senator Rubio.
0.0	0.211931653738	We have artificially low interest rates.
0.0	0.25849962887	I would choose Nelson Mandela for his generosity of heart, his understanding of the need for reconciliation.
0.0	0.243585739121	In fact, we need to -- wait a minute -- we need vigilance.
0.0	0.393559902318	Spent the first seven years of his life in Fascist Italy, under Benito Mussolini.
0.0	0.35996893614	But I know the negotiators in the world, and I put them one for each country.
0.0	0.0801898831891	It is not because of the tax writeoff.
0.0	0.0496172506562	It is a step forward.
0.0	0.309156600796	And that's what I hear from some people, "we'll do nothing and it will just be fixed."
0.0	0.363049014124	But the ideal scenario is to train Americans to do the work so we don't have to rely on people from abroad.
0.0	0.260967015852	Have a no fly zone in Syria and create safe zones to deal with the refugees.
0.0	0.202004833501	Just because this is not an esoteric argument.
0.0	0.414496505611	What kind of signal does that send to the rest of the world that the United States is a serious player in creating peace and security?
0.0	0.202768989024	And they'll be proud, and they'll love it, and they'll make much more than they would've ever made, and they'll be -- they'll be doing so well, and we're going to be thriving as a country, thriving.
0.0	0.4262572334	And now since this happened" -- it's up in the prison area -- "my husband and I are finally in agreement, because he wanted the guns.
0.0	0.146681078773	A terrible sight.
0.0	0.320868820305	We need to make sure that we do everything across all kinds of energy: natural gas, oil, absolutely.
0.0	0.386452672236	And the reason is, is that I've been a reformer all of my career, fighting to reform welfare, fighting to reform the Pentagon, also being in a position to balance the budget, because that is very, very hard to do.
0.0	0.226461039909	Well, I think there are some differences of opinion here, perhaps between the secretary and myself.
0.0	0.45039873039	I'm the only person on this stage that actually was involved in the chief architect of balancing the Federal Budget.
0.0	0.382732789822	Parents, and sons, and daughters and family members, and as our hearts go out to them and as our prayers go out to them, we must remember this, that this isn't the new face of conflict and warfare, not in the 20th century but the new face of conflict and warfare in the 21st century.
0.0	0.20851847542	We feel like we're being left behind and left out.
0.0	0.0238978152247	Excuse me.
0.0	0.193858771804	You have a big lawsuit over your head while you're running.

0.0	0.0623639401403	... Chris, your questions that you...
0.0	0.259053394081	So, let's stop fooling around about this, let's tell people the truth.
0.0	0.349099985062	No, what I said, Chris, was that the law needs to be followed.
0.0	0.493934395532	We inherited a system that was set up during World War II; 170 million Americans get health insurance right now through their employers.
0.0	0.270941979694	The young officer who was killed responding to the Planned Parenthood murders.
0.0	0.0207956512618	No, I love them.
0.0	0.213206278289	...Rand is exactly right.
0.0	0.376924432147	Make ourselves stronger at home, but also our role in the world, yes, is also to confront evil when it rises.
0.0	0.487802210369	And it is unfair simply to say how much more the program will cost without making sure that people know that, we are doing away with cost of private insurance and that the middle class will be paying substantially less for health care on the single payer than on the Secretary's Clinton proposal.
0.0	0.195029300961	We sent our Texas ranger recon teams.
0.0	0.337539160087	Senator Sanders, from a debate in 2008, quote what I said.

0.0	0.0745453942142	You know that.
0.0	0.378303230597	That comes out to $12,500 for each one.
0.0	0.189684850423	We want to be the United States of America.
0.0	0.399063688214	And to expand on Mr. Carson's -- or Dr. Carson's question, let's face it, we have laws already.
0.0	0.422337503045	According to the FBI and the director of national intelligence, Syria's becoming a perfect platform to strike our nation.

0.0	0.429165535327	I would hope that, given the extraordinary capacities that the tech community has and the legitimate needs and questions from law enforcement, that there could be a Manhattan-like project, something that would bring the government and the tech communities together to see they're not adversaries, they've got to be partners.
0.0	0.0127483360414	John.
0.0	0.405027328538	You know, I recently met with a group of mothers who lost their children to either killings by police or random killings in their neighborhoods, and hearing their stories was so incredibly, profoundly heartbreaking.
0.0	0.374580560485	And hopefully -- you know, Senator Graham, I -- I know where he's going to be on this, but we use Congress, and we use Congress to cut this funding.
0.0	0.109055980004	I believe we are on the path to doing that.
0.0	0.205713318883	No one here is under FBI investigation.

0.0	0.199717565295	That's not some sort of passe you know, antique sort of principle that safeguards our freedoms.
0.0	0.373352482821	Well Maria, thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the New York Times.
0.0	0.248456908404	And yes, it was a very difficult time.
0.0	0.245686432675	But I -- the struggle of single moms is extraordinary.
0.0	0.655890543212	And here's why.
0.0	0.0605787807165	He's wrong.
0.0	0.367243400184	And he stood before the American people and he said, "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself," a profound statement that gave the American people the courage to believe that, yes, we could get out of that terrible depression.
0.0	0.445387770674	That is why I support a $12 national federal minimum wage.
0.0	0.138103374049	Their family is waiting for them.

0.0	0.137434063392	You know, I -- my -- my mother taught me this.
0.0	0.347228827062	The natural next question is who actually has done so.
0.0	0.419794287379	And I would note the other individuals on this stage were nowhere to be found in that fight.
0.0	0.143846318662	But she did say there was anger.
0.0	0.342682031839	And Mr. Trump has a great capacity to use bluster and bigotry to inflame people and to make think there are easy answers to very complex questions.

0.0	0.00430451372677	Thank you.
0.0	0.471177948776	I think it's only fair to put on the record, Senator Sanders voted in the Senate for a resolution calling for ending the Gadhafi regime and asking that the U.N. be brought in, either a congressional vote or a U.N. Security Council vote.
1.0	0.410235544789	If you look at a single mom buying groceries, she sees hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent.
0.0	0.128764493959	Look, I look at our economy as an ecosystem.
0.0	0.280815583793	But you ought to acknowledge the government doesn't do a very good job at it.
0.0	0.313720381102	We need different solutions to solve the problems and to save our nation.
0.0	0.0335095571324	It has to be dealt with.
0.0	0.385628058618	The fact of the matter is, the more our people earn, the more money they spend, and the more our whole economy grows.
0.0	0.320804076292	We need to have everybody in our country focused on watching what happens and reporting it if it's suspicious, reporting what you hear.
0.0	0.2606577101	We need a strategy to destroy ISIS there.
0.0	0.10631613616	How are we gonna -- how are we gonna go back and make it great again?
0.0	0.341738084381	We should make women third-class citizens, that we should allow children to be sexually assaulted, that they are a danger to modern society.
0.0	0.302855974277	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.

0.0	0.318333784332	And I think when you give low-income kids -- African-American, white, Latino kids -- the opportunities to get their lives together, they are not going to end up in jail.
0.0	0.226836162289	This issue touches on two broad issues.
0.0	0.521054356387	And that's why today you still cannot support, as I do, breaking up the big banks and making sure that we pass a modern-day Glass- Steagall, like we had in late 1999, before it was repealed and led to the crash, where so many millions of families lost their jobs and their homes.
0.0	0.0675486812578	That's true.
1.0	0.979531302636	In fact, I think New Hampshire, in state tuition for public colleges and universities, is among the highest if not the highest in the country.
0.0	0.349370577153	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, it is demonstrably true...
0.0	0.0939444310289	We're running.
0.0	0.431296720881	I'm the only one on this stage who has a plan that's actually reduced -- actually going to reduce immigration.
0.0	0.364534879092	We ought to have politicians who not only have government experience but know how the CEOs and the job creators work.
0.0	0.39154837208	We need to lead a force, a Sunni led force inside of Syria.
0.0	0.257442992653	And I believe that Puerto Rico ought to have the right of self-determination.
0.0	0.288549940344	If you're not willing to do that, nobody wants to do it, but if you're not willing to gradually raise the age, you're not serious about fixing either one of them.
0.0	0.289969249586	You've got to keep asking because this is a hugely important issue.
0.0	0.213436662717	We bailed out Wall Street.
0.0	0.220334157344	The guns don't pull the trigger.
0.0	0.396427243177	But we're becoming a third word country, because of our infrastructure, our airports, our roads, everything.
0.0	0.439995981331	And I'll tell you why, last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee, she admitted she had sent emails to her family saying, hey, this attack in Benghazi was caused by al Qaeda-like elements.
0.0	0.243589727629	That is what is going to have to happen, if we want to revitalize and rebuild the crumbling middle class.
0.0	0.0414536722995	Absolutely.
0.0	0.180490304909	And, I will tell you, I love my life.
0.0	0.358599976493	We are at war with people who use their religion for purposes of power and oppression.
0.0	0.483614102011	We're going to combine all commercial activity in business into one place in the tax code and charge it 15 percent, which is going to suddenly make us competitive with the rest of the world.
0.0	0.0462230080772	I changed that.
0.0	0.309672642578	... and 85 percent of gun owners agree.
0.0	0.232046074796	Marco stood with Chuck Schumer and Barack Obama on amnesty.
0.0	0.371663850181	They're building a military island in the middle of the South China sea.
0.0	0.451800133823	You'll create a much better graduation rate at a lower cost, and you won't in debt the next generation with recourse debt on their backs.
0.0	0.36131551357	Let's allow companies to immediately expense.
0.0	0.28343144869	But the final thing I want to say about this is the following.
0.0	0.278590864939	We need to bring people together in Washington.
0.0	0.365836096766	And as someone who's worn the uniform of the country, that's how we build our military back up.
0.0	0.0698156192594	But this is what I do believe.
0.0	0.093813338006	And this summer, we didn't do that.
0.0	0.37310409434	But we have a unique time in America to connect with people all around the world that understand that there's an existential threat against all of them, the Arabs, the Jordanians, the Saudis, the Egyptians, our friends in Europe, including the Turks.
0.0	0.218611725661	And we do need China -- Donald's right about North Korea.
0.0	0.48500999235	I can tell you that as a mayor and as a governor, I learned certain disciplines which I believe are directly applicable to that very, very powerful and most important of all jobs in the United States, the president, whose first and primary duty is to protect the people of our country.
0.0	0.23696007738	The issue now is do we break them ?up do we reestablish Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.0745453942142	You know why?
0.0	0.328725798902	The administration originally said 10.
0.0	0.347798945165	The truth is it is relatively easy for a powerful nation like America to overthrow a dictator but it is very hard to predict the unintended consequences and the turmoil and the instability that follows after you overthrow that dictator.
0.0	0.0591317314833	They're great.
0.0	0.16618234333	So that is not by any stretch a pie in the sky.
0.0	0.463329458927	We shouldn't have the war fighters have their arms tied behind their back as President Obama wanted to do, but they had a chance to show support and it wasn't popular at the time.
0.0	0.316475096443	And what a sad sight that was: Men, women, children forced out of their homes.
0.0	0.315125072562	But I think -- and I say this with due respect -- that I worry too much that Secretary Clinton is too much into regime change and a little bit too aggressive without knowing what the unintended consequences might be.
1.0	0.968092519863	And this is not the first time that he has criticized President Obama.
0.0	0.101531771564	I agree completely.
1.0	0.963163492469	It absolutely has been, and at the time in the context of that was in 2009, and 2010, where the last effort for legalization was an effort done in the Senate.
0.0	0.440476311905	I will do everything I can to make certain that the United States and our brave men and women in the military do not get bogged down in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.
0.0	0.358588520229	But what is particularly insulting, though, is that he is the king of saying, "you're for amnesty."
0.0	0.373908299572	In the 1980s, it was in Beirut, Lebanon, under President Reagan's administration, and 258 Americans, marines, embassy personnel, and others were murdered.
0.0	0.244138684103	This is the only time I've had a chance, let me finish.
0.0	0.388097971868	That, I think, between the two of us demonstrates the strength of the support we have among people who want to see change in our country.
0.0	0.268116620964	Terrorism in this country scares everyone.
0.0	0.354799285637	Is creating much deeper, closer relations and, yes, coalitions within our own country.
0.0	0.317793204534	Of course we have to raise the minimum wage.
0.0	0.219219073159	In fact, sometimes it's not that way...
0.0	0.0418324113475	I was recruited to H.P.
0.0	0.205405542056	And when we talk about Wall Street, let's talk about Wall Street.
0.0	0.260326049304	... that's what you say in a primary.
0.0	0.218656280987	Now that he is, he's changed his tune.
0.0	0.221594659052	He made a deal with Chuck Schumer that he would oppose any conservative amendments.
0.0	0.363094029214	That's what I said to my own public health people.
0.0	0.271295240718	I will continue to have tremendous admiration and respect for Governor Bush.
0.0	0.410338815395	And in talking to a lot of our neighbors who are in that super wealthy, millionaire and billionaire category, a great numbers of them love their country enough to do more again in order to create more opportunity for America's middle class.
0.0	0.305040441226	And when I'm president, we're not just going to have a president that gives a State of the Union and says America is the greatest country in the world.
1.0	0.966093254698	There was a breach because the DNC vendor screwed up, information came to our campaign.
0.0	0.439803047226	What we have to do is put all of our resources through the Department of Homeland Security, through the State Department, through our intelligence agencies, and we have to have an increased vetting and screening.
0.0	0.237313140348	That's the right of people.
0.0	0.357480293121	Well, I would suggest a fair tax system, and that's what we have proposed.
0.0	0.19426845217	And, the fact is, none of them.
0.0	0.0179458472762	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.330890250907	And if people want a more high-minded politics and want to move our country forward, go on to martinomalley.com and help my campaign move our country forward.
0.0	0.268834018224	When you come back to me, I'll share that story.
0.0	0.0119521939187	We did our own rallies.
1.0	0.33417996305	When was the last time you saw a Chevrolet in Tokyo? It doesn't exist, folks.
0.0	0.35982202369	I would say the message that got us the win in Iowa and 10 other states against pretty overwhelming odds, is the message that's going to deliver us in this election.
0.0	0.466725453491	As you've indicated, what is happening in Syria, the number of people, the hundreds of thousands of people who have been killed -- men, women, 20,000 children, the people who are forced to flee their own country -- their own country -- it is unspeakable.
0.0	0.132658616288	We've got nothing.
0.0	0.150967734261	We need to define the enemy.
0.0	0.289585726224	I am certainly, absolutely, willing to look at that bill again and make sure there's a stronger bill.
0.0	0.384045571489	I'm glad he has produced enormous enthusiasm, and, every Donald Trump voter or potential voter, I hope to earn your support.
0.0	0.348374974865	Corporate inversion is one of the biggest problems we have.
0.0	0.383621904569	In Louisiana, instead we're helping people getting better paying jobs so they can provide for their own health care.
0.0	0.290034912283	And I'll tell you what Hillary Clinton has said: Hillary Clinton says she agrees with the dissenters -- the Supreme Court dissenters in the Heller case.
0.0	0.245198037847	Bill, I want to say one more thing about...
0.0	0.287939392281	Maria -- Maria, what you were talking about just now is called corporate inversion.
0.0	0.0599640396104	They think they are.
0.0	0.47823792822	John, listen, let's keep in mind that for one-third of the 60 million Americans on Social Security it represents 90 percent of their income.
0.0	0.211837796472	Well, this whole issue concerns me.
0.0	0.32182623045	That's absurd, and I think people who don't want to fix it, really, or unwilling to take the chance to say, "something has to change," are missing the boat here.
0.0	0.172499206972	Because I don't think the American people are all that interested in this.
0.0	0.40059300651	I also am very committed to getting the price of drugs down.
0.0	0.466793511473	I believe that when we have some 300 million guns in this country, I believe that when we have seen these horrific mass killings, not only in San Bernardino, but in Colorado and movie theaters in Colorado, I think we have got to bring together the vast majority of the people who do in fact believe in sensible gun safety regulations.
0.0	0.344127398756	But I wouldn't even waste my time with this one.
0.0	0.384467876258	Our staff found information on our computers from the Clinton campaign.
0.0	0.18894951568	We're going to get more revenue.
0.0	0.291788566657	That makes the world less peaceful, less safe.
0.0	0.360636572191	If you do that, you don't just change the economy, you transform the lives of millions of hurting Americans.
1.0	0.990283374364	We have the highest rate of childhood poverty among almost any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.294347832676	And that's the only way we'll ever balance our budget.
0.0	0.334855134843	We've been the most pro-life state six years in a row.
0.0	0.134140322596	I don't need the rhetoric.
0.0	0.294993688734	First statement is, we tell the billionaire class, "they cannot have it all."
0.0	0.124331245324	Come with me to Iraq and Afghanistan, folks.
0.0	0.181424692628	It's why you see the banks consolidating.
0.0	0.296761148668	And a rebuilt U.S. military is going to destroy these terrorists.
0.0	0.34773132174	Iran is going to take over the Middle East, Iran and somebody else will get the oil, and it turned out that Iran is now taking over Iraq.
0.0	0.417273371209	What's happening in Syria and Iraq is that, because of the failures in the region, including the failure of the prior government in Baghdad, led by Maliki, there has been a resurgence of Sunni activities, as exemplified by ISIS.
1.0	0.977674201847	Look, I have an A plus rating in the NRA and we also have a reduction in gun violence because in Florida, if you commit a crime with a gun, you're going away.
0.0	0.378016163666	We have to be prepared to defend the American people, prepare them for a long war, stand up for the defense of this country, and stand up for the values of this country...
0.0	0.306150030504	We need a president that doesn't just talk a game, but a president that's got real results.
0.0	0.430440472137	And remember this -- I'm credible on this for this reason: Americans for Tax Reform says that I've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history.
0.0	0.340673090342	But Maria, radical Islamic terrorism was not invented 24 months ago; 24 months ago, we had Al Qaida.
0.0	0.238798508038	Is there an area for a safety net?
0.0	0.430396964203	It was our money, and we brought them back to tend to the mentally ill. Because I don't think they ought to live in prison or live under a bridge; to treat the drug-addicted so they're not in an in-and-out-of- the-door policy out of the prisons; and to help the working poor so they don't live in emergency rooms.
0.0	0.397378602595	And so he undermines the Constitution, and he undermines free enterprise by expanding government, and he betrays our allies and cuts deals with our enemies and guts our military.
0.0	0.0363186190759	What's crony capitalism?
0.0	0.292563497353	I have nothing against the passion that my two friends here have about reinstating Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.179794673676	You know, you look at what's going on, you see all the divisiveness and the hatred that goes on in our society.
0.0	0.203287142997	And that's what this economy needs to -- that's what this debate needs to be about.
0.0	0.0760446166418	It ain't complicated.
0.0	0.103939104193	I have more accountants than I have nurses.
0.0	0.405255785669	If a person lives in a seven room house, does the government get to say you don't need seven rooms, we're going to take two of them away?
0.0	0.274537417223	Well, first of all, I've seen polls where I'm beating Hillary Clinton pretty regularly.
0.0	0.401334953525	When it comes to the audit the Fed bill, as Rand knows well, I was an original sponsor of the bill, I'm strongly supportive of it.
0.0	0.0898418561623	And I opposed it.
