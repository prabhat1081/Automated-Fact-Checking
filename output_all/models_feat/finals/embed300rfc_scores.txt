0.0	0.476188225586	It's campaign -- a corrupt campaign finance system.
0.0	0.470328733919	Well, the only thing - the only thing I can go on Senator Sanders...
0.0	0.467351707691	But what we need to do is turn it over to the regional powers to be able to handle that.
0.0	0.410541696185	And Martha...
0.0	0.477995801402	And a rebuilt U.S. military is going to destroy these terrorists.
0.0	0.462377668372	We both have a lot of small donors.
0.0	0.393273670025	Neil...
0.0	0.5	We'll tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money.
1.0	0.6074089126	As I understand it, the African-American community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse.
0.0	0.476962994801	But when we came to Washington, we made a different choice.
0.0	0.464619510424	You see, we usually elect presidents in America that want to change the things that are wrong in America.
0.0	0.468777743286	No Jeb, I don't remember -- well, let me tell you.
0.0	0.460300527974	We both want to get more revenue in.
0.0	0.482113682868	Corporate inversion is one of the biggest problems we have.
0.0	0.5	When you have six financial institutions in this country that issue two-thirds of the credit cards and one-third of the mortgages, when three out of four of them are larger today than when we bailed them out because they are too big to fail, we've got to re- establish Glass-Steagall, we have got to break the large financial institutions up.
1.0	0.5	We have the highest rate of childhood poverty, and we're the only country in the world -- virtually the only country that doesn't guarantee paid family and medical leave.
0.0	0.461129569281	I am not the candidate of Wall Street...
0.0	0.442719288891	It didn't have the votes to pass.
0.0	0.480416552112	It has to be based on what skills you have, what you can contribute economically, and most important of all, on whether or not you're coming here to become an American, not just live in America, but be an American.
0.0	0.460724249742	Our country has tremendous potential.
0.0	0.491839806736	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.425289018533	You can't have a question.
0.0	0.480995143205	No, it would have to go through the Congress, and I know the White House has actually been working with members of Congress.
0.0	0.5	So the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced: a simple flat tax, 10 percent for individuals, and a 16 percent business flat tax, you abolish the IRS...
0.0	0.490318750038	I want to find out why those two young people -- those two horrible young people in California when they shot the 14 people, killed them -- people they knew, people that held the wedding reception for them.
0.0	0.488646845544	And I was proud to get the endorsement of Mayor Walsh of Boston, who has made his struggle with alcoholism a real clarion call for action in this arena.
0.0	0.494954827443	First, we should pass the Expatriate Terrorist Act, legislation I've introduced that says if an American goes and joins ISIS and wages jihad against America, that you forfeit your citizenship and you can not come in on a passport.
0.0	0.478900335639	It will cause the economy to grow, to explode, to create more jobs.
0.0	0.487378689245	So I think we need radical changes in the funding of higher education.
0.0	0.487862988117	Washington gets bigger, taxes get higher, and the American people feel more distance from our government.
0.0	0.367994212245	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.526597510833	These...
0.0	0.5	I'm running for president because we have a campaign finance system which is corrupt, where billionaires are spending hundreds of millionaires of dollars to buy candidates who will represent their interests rather than the middle class and working families.
1.0	0.571877451363	You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don't agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements.
0.0	0.5	Any connection maybe to the fact that our people pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs?
1.0	0.436751903736	It isn't there anymore, Mike.
0.0	0.485100280362	You can't send your troops into harm's way unless you give them every opportunity to be successful.
0.0	0.45602909528	I think we should be for free trade but I think fair trade.
0.0	0.494780282972	Regulations in this country are out of control, especially the Employment Prevention Agency, the EPA, and all of the rules they continue to impose on our economy and hurting us.
0.0	0.465868967625	That's exactly what I'll do as president of the United States.
0.0	0.437102834273	It's become more complicated.
0.0	0.464425450918	Now I am the only candidate up here that doesn't have a super PAC.
0.0	0.485794125094	and they decide, we're going to raise it to 30 percent, plus we're going to raise the income tax to 30 percent.
0.0	0.481684992755	Secretary of state for four years.
0.0	0.463209083127	Get it done, because our -- our children and grandchildren are counting on us to get it done.
0.0	0.471744826781	But then they're going to get a call from the donors or probably from the lobbyist for Ford and say, "You can't do that to Ford, because Ford takes care of me and I take care of you, and you can't do that to Ford."
0.0	0.5	... Of course there will be a limit, but when today you have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, when the middle class is disappearing, you have the highest rate of child poverty of almost any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.459559127876	Now, what does that mean?
0.0	0.474039084451	But what happened is a political vacuum developed.
0.0	0.396675036735	They are not perfect.
0.0	0.5	Almost 60 percent of American people now need to hire an expert to understand their taxes.
0.0	0.399233474212	I agree with them.
0.0	0.478296644971	We have systemic racism and injustice and inequities in our country and in particular, in our justice system that must be addressed and must be ended.
0.0	0.443478927625	Let me say this.
0.0	0.436026764183	We needed 60.
0.0	0.489764554765	The great failing of these last 10 or 15 years, John, has been our failing of human intelligence on the ground.
0.0	0.526597510833	Megyn?
0.0	0.321389529923	Thank you.
0.0	0.5	And we won't be using a man like Secretary Kerry that has absolutely no concept of negotiation, who's making a horrible and laughable deal, who's just being tapped along as they make weapons right now, and then goes into a bicycle race at 72 years old, and falls and breaks his leg.
0.0	0.484417863604	We need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources, but from sources overseas, that can be a real-time fusion effort to get information where it's needed.
0.0	0.455636573517	It was a different situation in Afghanistan.
0.0	0.456514813625	That's why I ask for your support for president.
0.0	0.479021045977	Americans are tired of hearing this debate -- want to go to, what are you going to do about illegal immigration?
0.0	0.441127666198	It's great to be back.
0.0	0.478584437247	It's a blessing that we're living longer, so we have to increase the retirement age to reflect that blessing.
0.0	0.42791611791	... and I'll tell you why.
0.0	0.461308353074	Let me -- let me answer your question on the Sun-Sentinel editorial today.
0.0	0.48911079246	I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators -- back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.
0.0	0.48203560217	And -- and I would note indeed, the reason I said that is I was asked -- my friend Donald has taken to it as (ph) advance playing Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the USA", and I was asked what I thought of that.
0.0	0.466412002158	Right there, right next to the plant.
0.0	0.488910337528	Marco made the choice to go the direction of the major donors -- to support amnesty because he thought it was politically advantageous.
0.0	0.467974192912	Let me tell you, everybody, when they say they want to give it to you for free, keep your hands on your wallets because they're coming to you to pay for it.
0.0	0.490402374286	And now what we have is a whole stretch now, of the coast of Libya, 100 miles, 150 miles, that has now become potentially the next safe haven for ISIL.
0.0	0.476432811729	We're on the verge of being the first generation of Americans that leave our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.483114604767	I didn't get a phone call from Bill Clinton before I jumped in the race.
0.0	0.46663458501	So count me in as somebody who will not be listening to Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.48065967883	And unlike President Obama, where he refuses even to use the term of what's going on, he can't use the term for whatever reason.
0.0	0.488386176238	And they have a desire not simply to conquer the Middle East and to become the dominant power in that region, but ultimately to be able to hold America hostage.
0.0	0.471335657952	But in order to bring about the changes that we need, we need a political revolution.
0.0	0.526597510833	No.
0.0	0.492973496938	If it's Medicare for all, then you no longer have the Affordable Care Act, because the Affordable Care Act, as you know very well, is based on the insurance system, based on exchanges, based on a subsidy system.
0.0	0.473933680563	In fact, frankly, he's complaining about the fact that we're losing some of the most talented people.
0.0	0.5	So we pay for this by do demanding that the wealthiest people and the largest corporations, who have gotten away with murder for years, start paying their fair share.
0.0	0.469713950267	We've already got a great talker in the White House.
1.0	0.580772567047	They knew that they were talking about trying to take our country and attack it.
0.0	0.39847947423	No, not at all, absolutely not.
0.0	0.402032515142	How great is that?
0.0	0.474475861553	Well, I think that they're be pretty smart, because I think a lot of the states will do the right thing, and I think those states that don't will pay a heavy penalty.
0.0	0.465900087726	There's so much work that can be done, so much we've learned to do better.
1.0	0.62166478878	When President Obama came into office we were losing 800,000 jobs a month, 800,000 jobs a month.
0.0	0.480779971517	Middle class may notice it when they get to the cash register.
0.0	0.486595485568	I agree, however, it doesn't go far enough, because what it focuses on are the big banks, which Senator Sanders has talked about a lot, for good reason.
0.0	0.467878097262	I did it as the chairman of the Budget Committee, working with Senator Domenici.
0.0	0.5	I would like the federal government to offer $10 billion over ten years to work with states, and I really applaud Governor Hassan for taking up this challenge and working with the legislature here to come up with a plan.
0.0	0.434883528543	My oldest daughter's a teacher.
0.0	0.427468777651	So I don't think...
0.0	0.469764487557	They have to come into this country legally.
0.0	0.489038525221	We're borrowing a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.461410964925	Not the change we need at a time we need it.
0.0	0.481440753177	But I have no argument with anyone making up her mind about who to support.
0.0	0.5	If we want to create jobs for the folks that you're talking about, who are having trouble getting off government benefits, primarily because of their low skill level, there is no better way -- it's worked for 100 years in America -- putting people back to work in manufacturing is it.
0.0	0.460973984944	And it's just not going to work.
0.0	0.487341990381	Let me tell you something, when you see thousands upon thousands upon thousands of children being murdered in the womb, I can't think of anything better than that.
0.0	0.479122752383	And where we are right now is we have got to stand up to the Trumps of the world who are trying to divide us up.
0.0	0.410138393004	I will do that.
0.0	0.469900319502	But it is a general economic issue.
0.0	0.485216934259	Secondly, to go after and dismantle their global network of terrorism.
0.0	0.474867291717	Here's what I would do Neil, I would appoint an Attorney General and I would have one very brief conversation with that Attorney General.
0.0	0.409638274041	(inaudible).
0.0	0.478038538332	Secondly, as it relates to Iran, we need to confront their ambitions across the board.
0.0	0.478859488412	And as president, I will rebuild the military and keep this country safe.
0.0	0.475352894803	I sell tens' of millions of (inaudible).
0.0	0.48002277761	We have more Americans out of work or just Americans who quit looking for work for 40 years.
0.0	0.5	And then on top of that, we've got a corrupt campaign finance system in which millionaires and billionaires are pouring huge sums of money into super PACS heavily influencing the political process.
0.0	0.392877911014	There's -- look, there's --
0.0	0.409638274041	(inaudible).
0.0	0.463484842327	And I'm going to tell you, that it -- I'm going to suggest to you here tonight, that you can't do on the job training.
0.0	0.483907845014	But Maria, radical Islamic terrorism was not invented 24 months ago; 24 months ago, we had Al Qaida.
0.0	0.437459820564	Just a little bit.
0.0	0.419024579961	And it's the most regressive tax there is.
0.0	0.471680607248	The government ought to wear a striped shirt and just make sure the game...
0.0	0.483423977978	I'm also going to take a bottle of White-Out with me to get started on all those executive orders that Mr. Obama has put his name to.
0.0	0.422301430922	Yes.
0.0	0.460120761156	And so that is part of the reason why this is so difficult.
0.0	0.492926200058	We will rebuild the military to make sure that it is a solid force, not to be the world's policeman, but to make sure that in a peaceful world, people know that the United States is there to take care of our own national interests and take care of our allies.
0.0	0.5	I tried (ph), early in my marriage, explaining to my wife why someone named Sallie Mae was taking $1,000 out of our bank account every month.
0.0	0.405171745201	A step forward.
0.0	0.479380053273	And I recognize -- I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa.
0.0	0.475280114463	And here's the problem in this country right now.
0.0	0.477019341816	We also want to dominate this from a commercial side.
0.0	0.382885531678	It's a joke.
0.0	0.480209688079	And the problem, Maria, is that the military is not ready, either.
0.0	0.463206917579	We have been debating right here the core difference between conservatism and progressivism.
0.0	0.455801175982	And I'm saying we have to get to the bottom of it.
0.0	0.488172377359	If we had guns in California on the other side where the bullets went in the different direction, you wouldn't have 14 or 15 people dead right now.
0.0	0.458319790443	The economy was really booming.
0.0	0.47825883484	In terms of my faith, look, all I say is that when I study scripture, I know that people who live in the shadows need to have a chance.
0.0	0.414581441943	And guess what?
0.0	0.482708292649	You know I understand why Donald made the comments he did and I understand why Americans are feeling frustrated and scared and angry when we have a president who refuses to acknowledge the threat we face and even worse, who acts as an apologist for radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.404468067381	So I have voiced criticisms.
0.0	0.474752851945	Get the lawyers off the damn backs of the military once and for all.
0.0	0.460055946275	Common Core should -- it is a disaster.
0.0	0.489366079182	Bottom line here is, in the year 2015, we should look at a college degree the same way we looked at a high school degree 50 or 60 years ago.
0.0	0.5	And so much of what we did -- to force competition, to use technology, to stand down the special interest groups -- can you imagine taking Medicaid from 10 to 2.5 percent?
1.0	0.5	$10.10 was all I could get the state to do by the time I left in my last year.
0.0	0.467795908613	It's not just Wall Street.
0.0	0.488423403516	And Turkey, by the way, did a very decent thing, providing what was reasonable housing and conditions for those people.
0.0	0.454077922939	Everybody is really doing some bad fact...
0.0	0.480282912992	So I know something about economic anxiety and living in a family does not have sufficient income.
0.0	0.462191675377	Here is where we are with public education.
0.0	0.473720840657	They've got to quit sponsoring Hezbollah and Hamas.
0.0	0.47283854309	Well, one of us ran against Barack Obama.
0.0	0.5	But if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things, including corporate taxes, and including the capital gains taxes, you make that amount up pretty quickly.
0.0	0.46519869223	So yes, you're going to hear a lot of talk about tax reform --
0.0	0.429898753981	Right.
0.0	0.449787420923	You know, we all have our own individual interpretations of our faith.
0.0	0.5	You'll create a much better graduation rate at a lower cost, and you won't in debt the next generation with recourse debt on their backs.
0.0	0.5	Mine is the only plan that saves over $1 trillion and that's why I'm answering your question.
0.0	0.429898753981	That's right.
0.0	0.442269079865	Their family is waiting for them.
0.0	0.475535090949	I want a government so small I can barely see it.
0.0	0.438668003327	The Shi'a-Sunni split.
0.0	0.491384126407	And it is a fact that the net immigration from Mexico and South has basically zeroed out.
0.0	0.462961050677	And thirdly, to do more to keep us safe.
0.0	0.470608188084	And so -- and I've always made that clear about that cover story.
0.0	0.448015298971	You know, Ted didn't show up.
0.0	0.491576458725	The Kurds have been asking us to arm them for three years.
0.0	0.445521119914	And that's not what's happening now.
0.0	0.422889465113	Thank you very much.
0.0	0.494660735248	And every time we give Iraq equipment, the first time a bullet goes off in the air, they leave it.
0.0	0.489128425235	But now, that light is dimming a little, after seven years of Barack Obama.
0.0	0.491221084716	Do you remember when he ran for president of the United States, and he was a candidate, and he went and said, "These Americans with traditional values, they are bitter people, and they cling to their guns and to their religion."
0.0	0.438521819494	And when they let me down, if they let me down, I never forgive.
0.0	0.462319651307	I have many friends that deal with China.
0.0	0.484078768938	The days for the Clintons in public housing are over.
0.0	0.460068069683	There is a pretty excruciating process that refugees go through.
0.0	0.410541696185	No, Martha, I would not.
0.0	0.457911632879	I said, "They send it back?"
0.0	0.437227788064	I love Donald Trump.
0.0	0.49242132928	They have now created a safe haven in the vacuum that we allowed to be partly and because of our blunders, to be created to be created in the areas of Syria and Iraq.
0.0	0.462573597788	He's in favor of Common Core.
0.0	0.461931413352	And they wanted to make sure it got built.
0.0	0.47479867732	But I like to be unpredictable so that people don't know exactly... (LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.476891654042	Donald Trump actually seized on it when he talked about immigration.
0.0	0.470219175277	This is incredibly complicated, because we've got Iran as a big player, in addition to Russia.
0.0	0.456870383828	I want to talk to the folks at home.
0.0	0.482902121132	We need major, major reforms of a very broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.483782133322	This has gone on 50 or 60 years where the United States has been involved in overthrowing governments.
0.0	0.437916651633	I hope the Supreme Court upholds them.
0.0	0.49032762177	The only way we're are going to be able to move forward after two migratory crises with minor, after two unconstitutional executive orders, the only way forward on this issue is to first bring illegal immigration under control.
0.0	0.45583707741	We know this for a fact.
0.0	0.490251265045	And you put me on that stage against her next September, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.437190989671	Again, Americans murdered.
0.0	0.488907981208	I think that there are many other reasons why it has in addition to what happened in the region, but I don't think that the United States has the bulk of the responsibility.
0.0	0.476615179967	And maybe the back door is the wrong door, and I understand what Apple and others are saying about that.
0.0	0.483173177612	Both Democrats and Republicans have gotten us in the mess we're in -- $18 trillion of debt, a bad deal with Iran, we're not staying with Israel.
0.0	0.478078833101	We actually passed a living wage.
0.0	0.526597510833	...
0.0	0.453937837122	But I believe in the Teddy Roosevelt philosophy.
0.0	0.5	And we need to hear the voices of those men and women and boys and girls who feel like strangers in their own country and do whatever is necessary to not only deal with the immediate problems within the criminal justice system, but more opportunities, more jobs, better education so that we can begin to rebuild that very valuable asset known as trust.
0.0	0.413566827013	I really am.
0.0	0.457277210336	Yes, they've got to get out of Syria.
0.0	0.406508006029	We need a doer, not a talker.
0.0	0.458041107795	That's not the America that I've ever known.
0.0	0.410138393004	They will not.
0.0	0.444615961186	And no matter what your faith is, that's what I want you to be able to do.
0.0	0.485754507193	And now many of these candidates want to cut it.
0.0	0.489827395025	And, I'll note finally, Chris, there is a reason that Iowa's Congressman Steve King, perhaps the fiercest defender of farmers in this state, is sharing my campaign.
0.0	0.408221861198	This stuff is fantasy.
0.0	0.5	I agree, we need better -- we need to rein in the over- prescribing, but I have put forward on my -- in my plan a $12 billion federal investment.
0.0	0.489220423198	And they've come pretty close to that without federal government assistance.
0.0	0.464676229796	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.494849694149	We can put America back on track on a growth level and a growth rate that we've never seen in the history of this country.
0.0	0.465728808623	I said, "Oh, wait a minute, that's terrible.
0.0	0.494754673559	I will tell you, you could win a bet at a bar tonight, since we're talking about fantasy football, if you ask who the top three states in America are that produce solar energy: California and Arizona are easy, but number three is New Jersey.
0.0	0.480234901284	If you take donations from Wall Street, you can't be independent.
0.0	0.470033688239	And if I misrepresented those results or those projections in any way, I was held criminally liable.
0.0	0.492220969451	That is why we have troops in Iraq that are helping to train and build back up the Iraqi military, why we have special operators in Syria working with the Kurds and Arabs, so that we can be supportive.
0.0	0.377302701734	It's not crass.
0.0	0.421146299043	But here's what's going to happen:
0.0	0.471375615653	I think the only argument is are we a sovereign country, are we not allowed to choose who comes in, when they come in and how they come in?
0.0	0.460126890761	Let's talk about something that happened this week in the news.
0.0	0.466232578242	But, I don't believe that Washington should be picking winners and losers.
0.0	0.476520220409	Is there going to be any change in the House with new leadership?
0.0	0.464592460768	But also, I can't fake anger.
1.0	0.611437007113	In fact, I think New Hampshire, in state tuition for public colleges and universities, is among the highest if not the highest in the country.
0.0	0.478825293137	I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would.
0.0	0.477401892883	Sure, because there has been three different investigations and proven that I knew nothing.
0.0	0.452585254032	Hey look, he never had a chance.
1.0	0.569302299003	Secondly, I never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.484754009371	And I appreciate greatly Senator Sanders' voting record.
0.0	0.478685954363	And it is a -- the kind of criticism that we've heard from Senator Sanders about our president I expect from Republicans.
0.0	0.462856375761	I'll advertise my Web site as well.
0.0	0.436827888405	They're laughing at us, at our stupidity.
0.0	0.445714117426	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.468439953085	They want everyone in this country to follow their religious beliefs the way they do.
0.0	0.412151779281	That's off the table...
0.0	0.468533631316	We're rebuilding many countries.
0.0	0.452586219106	If they want to accept our values and our laws.
0.0	0.494719272063	But Jeb is also right that, if we just impose a tariff, they'll put reciprocal tariffs, which will hurt Iowa farmers and South Carolina producers and 20 percent of the American jobs that depend on exports.
0.0	0.440667219486	We're laughed at all over the world.
0.0	0.475213323888	That sounds like people are afraid the president's going to take their guns away.
0.0	0.486397233833	We have to continue to work with the Iraqi army so that they are better prepared to advance on some of the other strongholds inside Iraq, like Mosul, when they are able to do so.
0.0	0.47998116151	When that battle was waged, my friend Senator Rubio chose to stand with Barack Obama and Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer and support amnesty.
0.0	0.484440601736	Well, look the Joint Terrorism Task Force needs resources and tools.
1.0	0.507528509677	And I have assets -- big accounting firm, one of the most highly respected -- 9 billion 240 million dollars.
0.0	0.445111005752	You gotta be creative and imaginative.
0.0	0.456422482773	How stupid are these politicians to allow this to happen?
0.0	0.473723195129	Bush is totally in favor of Common Core.
0.0	0.47231994659	We need a strategy to destroy ISIS there.
0.0	0.395033125926	HEMMER: Wow.
0.0	0.389975372381	She did it for convenience.
0.0	0.417507118262	I hate to hear it."
0.0	0.479549194211	We need a ground force in Iraq and Syria, and America has to be part of that ground force.
0.0	0.411955118679	You're welcome.
0.0	0.422207733101	And you know what?
0.0	0.475745849981	I've been to Ferguson, I've been trying to look for solutions to our criminal justice problem.
0.0	0.488931163385	It would just -- you absolutely have to get involved with China, they are taking so much of what we have in terms of jobs in terms of money.
0.0	0.47765763345	We now have a 73,000-page tax code.
1.0	0.605893319245	They would give more tax breaks to the super-wealthy and corporations, not to the middle class.
0.0	0.470122366923	If we don't know who you are, or why you're coming, you will not get into the United States.
0.0	0.471403566931	You know, when President Obama was elected, I said, "Well, the one thing, I think he'll do well.
0.0	0.475808233075	And that's why they have it in Europe, because it is a way to blindfolded the people, that's what Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.460969614772	It's fine if they come in, but they have to come in legally.
0.0	0.479196575472	We need to make sure that we do everything across all kinds of energy: natural gas, oil, absolutely.
0.0	0.470187102132	And I used it to pay off my loans.
0.0	0.456570473635	So they clearly think I'm going to do what I say I will do and you can look at what I did in the Senate.
0.0	0.486861994133	Well, there is no question that some people go overboard when it comes to trying to make profits, and they don't take into consideration the American people.
0.0	0.436143893778	Do we still have values and principles?
0.0	0.375960462366	Appreciate it.
0.0	0.484467239245	This is about more than replacing a D with an R. We need a leader who will help us take our government back.
0.0	0.472305737369	You're not going to be able to ram down the throat of the American people your approach.
0.0	0.490722901622	As a former mayor and a former governor, there was never a single day, John, when I went to bed or woke up without realizing that this could happen in our own country.
0.0	0.476872792814	So let's demand open trade but fair trade in this country.
0.0	0.493394330911	So, in terms of refugees, I believe that the United States has the moral responsibility with Europe, with Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia to make sure that when people leave countries like Afghanistan and Syria with nothing more than the clothing on their back that, of course, we reach out.
0.0	0.457246945281	I would invite him, I actually would say.
0.0	0.491139625099	It's always a solution of the left to create more Government from the Federal Government.
0.0	0.460492092643	So let's set the facts straight.
0.0	0.412165101177	I would change them.
0.0	0.494775120137	Unfortunately, Governor Christie has endorsed many of the ideas that Barack Obama supports, whether it is Common Core or gun control or the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor or the donation he made to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.479880362883	And listen, there is a real difference between Marco's tax plan and mine.
0.0	0.470633572447	He needs to recognize that those kinds of things are in fact an existential threat to us.
0.0	0.49111532516	You have to be hit by a tractor, literally, a tractor, to use it, because the deductibles are so high, it's virtually useless.
0.0	0.5	But at the end of the day, Wall Street today has enormous economic and political power.
0.0	0.433542921916	They don't believe in any of that.
0.0	0.485086925159	Could we loan you $4 billion"?
0.0	0.467834058455	We're going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education.
0.0	0.488501638637	A person who, in fact, has a long experience in foreign-policy issues, which is different from many of the other governors and prospective governors who are running.
0.0	0.477637773495	And if you listen to what they say -- and I had a chance over those 11 hours to watch and listen, as well as what I see in their debates -- they are putting forth alarming plans.
0.0	0.452549985707	We disagreed on the war in Iraq.
0.0	0.445325780054	He was the only Republican that didn't show up for it.
0.0	0.462700102962	So I said to myself, you know, nobody's ever going to know unless I run, because I'm really proud of my success.
0.0	0.486747867918	I will deliver for the American people if I have the privilege of leading this country.
0.0	0.480675122242	First, to go after them and deprive them of the territory they occupy now in both Syria and Iraq.
0.0	0.488731684904	Seventy percent of our population lives bi-coastally).
0.0	0.460502091395	Just because this is not an esoteric argument.
0.0	0.490237153737	But I look forward to signing that bill into law as president and auditing the Fed and providing needed accountability at the Federal Reserve.
0.0	0.471559221324	Rand's amendment was not the right way to do it.
0.0	0.417240963776	No problem.
0.0	0.462899526651	Make our police officers proud of what they do but more important than that, let them know how proud we are of them."
0.0	0.472565468397	Our country is in serious trouble.
0.0	0.442723388449	They were smarter than our leaders.
0.0	0.468131858127	Yeah, but the rule includes equal -- got it.
0.0	0.472012257437	Under -- under Barack Obama and the proposals of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and others, they've tried it their way, and it has failed miserably.
0.0	0.462558104649	But I would say this to you, Bret.
0.0	0.526597510833	...
0.0	0.5	And in that capacity, I met with just an extraordinary group of people from World War II, from korea, vietnam, all of the wars.
0.0	0.488362665332	We have got to demilitarize local police departments so they do not look like occupying armies.
0.0	0.464745914853	Well, this whole issue concerns me.
0.0	0.476267940495	None of these instances that the president points to as the reason why he's doing these things would have been preventive.
0.0	0.478344505975	So if you happen to be right, you could get the top job at the end of the day.
0.0	0.5	I will cut this government down to size and hold it accountable, simplify the tax code, roll back the regulations that have been spewing out of Washington, D.C. for 50 years.
0.0	0.507058112452	After those four years of looking back and being prepared, the preparation to be the most powerful individual in the world requires an extraordinary amount of work: not just having been the governor of the 12th largest economy in the world, which I might add, we added 1.5 million jobs during that period of time over that 2007 through 2014 period, a period when America was going through the most deep recession it had been through since the Great Depression.
0.0	0.491993657468	It was the most highly sought after -- or one of them, but I think the most highly sought after project in the history of General Services.
0.0	0.47769525005	It's a private-sector solution that believes in freedom, not Obamacare that believes in government control.
0.0	0.475648134737	So ladies and gentlemen...I am officially running...... for president of the United States, and we are going to make our country great again.
0.0	0.48944251065	... in addition to that, we go ahead and we take the oil from them, their source of revenue.
0.0	0.49496084242	It will lead to even greater war in this world.
0.0	0.491436414945	We have 30,000 fewer state bureaucrats than the day I took office.
0.0	0.485641870742	And Megyn, it's best not to talk anymore about back doors and encryption, it will get solved, but it needs to be solved in the situation of the White House with the technology folks.
0.0	0.445171092534	We can do a wall.
0.0	0.485389509814	Had that actually -- that same columnist wrote a column comparing me to an evil demonic spirit from the move, "It Follows" that jumps apparently from body to body possessing people.
0.0	0.475243986012	And with respect to my own husband, I am probably still going to pick the flowers and the china for state dinners and stuff like that.
0.0	0.48438805534	I've done it once in Washington, with great jobs and lower taxes.
0.0	0.478242360647	But now as I travel the country, people say what I feel.
0.0	0.458665849426	We're going to create a border.
0.0	0.441858976657	Our next president...
0.0	0.480067845928	Not only -- not only do I apologize to Secretary Clinton -- and I hope we can work together on an independent investigation from day one -- I want to apologize to my supporters.
0.0	0.484201657447	I was a person who has dealt extensively with these homeland security issues.
0.0	0.459865838924	They elected moderate leaders.
0.0	0.401632010466	So I'm doing great.
0.0	0.5	$2.5 billion, it's going to be one of the largest in the world.
0.0	0.489455018853	Number one, our goal is to crush and destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.4838143367	Chris, I would note that that the last four questions have been, "Rand, please attack Ted.
0.0	0.47459943831	They discussed how -- how hard it is to sell tractors in China, because all the regulatory barriers.
0.0	0.483244962312	But as Bill said earlier, Roe v. Wade, it's has been the law for 42 years, and I don't think we should continue to try to change it.
0.0	0.489854030104	Well, first of all, if a company gets caught doing that, they should never be able to use the program again.
0.0	0.362866226325	Ford.
0.0	0.402100300456	With all the candidates, why me?
0.0	0.386124609134	I can't do it.
0.0	0.359967529749	): Secretary...
0.0	0.433704747838	That is exactly...
0.0	0.475437003092	Examine our records, pray on it and I will be honored if you and your family will come caucus for us on Monday night.
0.0	0.470569195298	But I think we have got to get our foreign policies and priorities right.
0.0	0.455463904531	It is going to be amazingly destructive.
0.0	0.478846232142	And I'll tell you what a weakness is of this country: there are a lot of people who are sick and tired because Washington does not play by the same rules that the American people have to play by.
0.0	0.475927900468	But they're going to have incentive to work, because the greatest social program is a job.
0.0	0.41376665074	And that is what we have done in Ohio.
0.0	0.470315018048	Well, John, let me concur with you and with all Americans who are shocked and disgusted by what we saw in Paris yesterday.
0.0	0.474032296335	We've got to stop this culture of government dependence.
0.0	0.451916170078	You will have welcomed my dad to preach at your churches.
0.0	0.485620653456	I have made the decisions that need to be made as a governor to protect us and as president of the United States, no one will keep this country safer than I will.
0.0	0.43986753555	I mean, you know...
0.0	0.468966595192	I do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination to succeed President Obama.
0.0	0.466881811572	But their leaders are much smarter than our leaders, and we can't sustain ourself with that.
1.0	0.468099864657	They can't get jobs, because there are no jobs, because China has our jobs and Mexico has our jobs.
0.0	0.466782225835	In fact, I'd love him to leave early and play, that would be a very good thing.
0.0	0.458759334157	Let me just jump in.
0.0	0.463442652799	And it's not the folks on Wall Street.
0.0	0.423669605617	See, here's the thing.
0.0	0.488176276311	... we have the tools in federal law to do this now.
0.0	0.483682881696	Our legal immigration system from now on has to be merit-based.
0.0	0.433359799384	You know, I see a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist.
0.0	0.5	And it's why I've continued to focus on the fact that we need to declare war on the four big cost drivers because 80 percent of all medical costs in this country are chronic disease.
0.0	0.478206374731	And we have people that are controlled by special interests.
0.0	0.466112111668	But I want to talk -- I want to talk about something else, because Secretary Clinton I think made some interesting and good points.
0.0	0.478578948029	But I'll tell you what would have happened, if we had not joined with our European partners and our Arab partners to assist the people in Libya, you would be looking at Syria.
0.0	0.476959743673	So I think that we need to build on the work of the policing commissioner that President Obama impaneled.
0.0	0.494969808969	And then in addition to that, the American people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.418456283923	They're not good.
0.0	0.469162339503	We must keep America safe from this threat.
0.0	0.452566338924	Look, what we need on this issue is not more polls.
0.0	0.480355797202	Wait a minute, he has basically used his answer to impune my integrity.
0.0	0.483054471432	And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, because I've been a leader on these issues.
0.0	0.458035604827	We have tremendous people.
0.0	0.5	So under my compact, the federal government will match money that the states begin to put back in to the higher education system.
0.0	0.398716182033	They expect to have it.
0.0	0.473418539035	Well, Maria, I'm glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what's going on in the world.
0.0	0.464372336036	I'm not that much of a socialist compared to Eisenhower.
0.0	0.469645199829	I'm deadly serious about doing this job the right way.
0.0	0.418768915286	That's American capitalism.
0.0	0.488707426597	And we have to cut off the flow of foreign funding and foreign fighters.
0.0	0.451531943684	We don't eliminate Medicare.
0.0	0.461237366328	As far as the wall is concerned, we're going to build a wall.
0.0	0.430242673826	But I did want to -- I wanted to follow up.
0.0	0.468751438442	So I just truly, with all my heart belief, I like everybody on the stage.
0.0	0.477604720935	And I also have detailed plans to fix the mess in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.485818059563	So if Ms. Davis wanted to step aside and get rid of her ability to be able to do that, there should be someone else in that office who it didn't violate their conscience so they could follow the law of the state of Kentucky.
0.0	0.438753205444	But we don't see it happening at all.
0.0	0.474709528057	I have talked to some of the young kids with tears rolling down their cheeks, are scared to death that today they may or their parents may be deported.
0.0	0.428977039905	And that doesn't have to be true.
0.0	0.491932903825	One of them is a statewide use of deadly force.
0.0	0.423896306088	They're not wrong.
0.0	0.421461485094	That's for sure.
0.0	0.476860264892	They're going to take away thousands of jobs.
0.0	0.415135030754	This is an emergency.
0.0	0.432668701649	We're dying.
0.0	0.482671331256	Let me tell you that, in this country -- in this country, people are concerned about their economic future.
0.0	0.478147015718	I want to speak to all our fighting men and women.
0.0	0.477396106485	I think America can only live up to its potential when we make sure that every American has a chance to live up to his or her potential.

0.0	0.5	We have arrived at a point in our nation's history where the potential of this nation and too many Americans is being crushed by the weight, the power, the cost, the complexity, the ineptitude, the corruption of the federal government, and only someone who will challenge the status quo of Washington, D.C. can lead the resurgence of this great nation.

0.0	0.455986765571	Let me just -- let me respond.
0.0	0.482022468329	We need to be the nation whose enduring symbol is the Statue of Liberty, and we need to act like the great country we are, according to our values.
0.0	0.5	It means that we have to rethink the so-called war on drugs which has destroyed the lives of millions of people, which is why I have taken marijuana out of the Controlled Substance Act.

0.0	0.482590718619	The first thing -- I don't know of anyone who's not in favor of fully vetting people that are trying to come into this country, other than perhaps Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.5	I want to speak to all the moms and dads whose sons and daughters are fighting for this country, and the incredible sense of betrayal when you have a commander-in-chief who will not even speak the name of our enemy, radical Islamic terrorism, when you have a commander-in- chief who sends $150 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, who's responsible for murdering hundreds of our servicemen and women.

0.0	0.468373015122	And we need the right people.
0.0	0.481345109349	And all over New Hampshire, I met grandmothers who are raising children because they lost the father or the mother to an overdose.
0.0	0.490134715961	Ultimately, we have got to say as a nation, Secretary Clinton, is health care a right of all people or is it not?

0.0	0.383745699129	We have losers.

0.0	0.493570327891	We cannot allow safe havens, and as a leader of moral nations around this Earth, we need to come up with new alliances and new ways to prepare for these new sorts of threats, because Martha, this will not be the last region where nation-states fail.
0.0	0.427665380184	It's not going to happen tomorrow.

0.0	0.473054153927	By the way, no nation on earth is more generous than America is.
0.0	0.478591265506	And that free education of extraordinary accomplishment was from first grade to 12th grade.
0.0	0.443088055218	And, folks, we will.
0.0	0.475728063586	What you have now is a very dangerous moment in American history.

0.0	0.486069709688	I was a mayor for eight years, worked very closely with a great police department.
0.0	0.48245728782	I believe we should focus on middle-class families, working families, and poor kids who have the ambition and the talent to go to college and get ahead.
0.0	0.441848631222	And I think this is an important question.
0.0	0.474165696476	My state is doing great across the board.
0.0	0.407984379839	And the reason -- and the reason...
0.0	0.493594350501	You know, when you go into the store and buy a box of laundry detergent, and the price has up -- you know, 50 cents because of regulations, a poor person notices that.
0.0	0.5	For example, talking about polls, a poll recently came out, overwhelming majority of the American people say we should strengthen the instant background check.
0.0	0.483050554944	But I'm not worried about my finances, I'm worried about the finances of everyday Americans who today are struggling in an economy that is not producing good paying jobs while everything else costs more.
0.0	0.427353723003	That is beyond unspeakable.
0.0	0.488151286417	Like we have a -- we have a lot of work to do and we're the only nation on the planet that buries as many of our people from gun violence as we do.
0.0	0.461964971829	But it's a falseness, and that's an authenticity problem -- that everybody he knows is not as perfect as him because we're all for amnesty.
0.0	0.467286836384	And I think Ted Kennedy had a very clear idea about what needed to be done.
0.0	0.443028302014	It continues with regulatory reform.
0.0	0.491791437015	Reinstating Glass- Steagall is a part of what very well could help, but it is nowhere near enough.
0.0	0.395033125926	Wow.
0.0	0.488542917473	If we are not successful, if we continue the same old, same old of Washington being run by corporate lobbyists and big-money interests, nothing changes.
1.0	0.604501899042	Look, I have an A plus rating in the NRA and we also have a reduction in gun violence because in Florida, if you commit a crime with a gun, you're going away.
0.0	0.39847947423	Absolutely.
0.0	0.465092102228	Never been done before, never been done since.
0.0	0.5	Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well.
0.0	0.463845389276	Martha -- I would just repeat that --
0.0	0.489344373573	I mean the fact is, is that they need to put the pressure on and frankly we need to intercepts ships coming out of North Korea so they don't proliferate all these dangerous materials.
0.0	0.441218623612	It's hate action.
0.0	0.449758177189	I'll keep -- I'll keep heading in that direction, believe me.
0.0	0.488010336779	And there's all sorts of ways that can be done at the state, local and federal level to do that.
0.0	0.484446021865	What our nation needs right now is to realize that, while we face a terrible danger, we also face a different sort of political danger.

0.0	0.526597510833	No -- no...
0.0	0.459981284233	Professional politician that can't be trusted.
0.0	0.5	If they hear people running for president who basically shortcut it to say we are somehow against Islam, that was one of the real contributions, despite all the other problems, that George W.

0.0	0.492066250212	The isolationist is the one who wants to continue to follow a foreign policy that has fewer democracies today than when Barack Obama came into office around the world.

0.0	0.462008768603	Well, Neil, I'm glad we're focusing on the important topics of the evening.
0.0	0.492328940724	We rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, our roads our bridges, our rail systems, we create 13 million jobs with a trillion-dollar investment.
0.0	0.474428344418	I said, "I think that number one, I am a nice person.
0.0	0.464772842396	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.473421941402	They believe some are smarter than others, some are better than others, so some are going to need to take care of others.
0.0	0.485671447305	That should be a right of all Americans regardless of the income of their families.
0.0	0.420978161633	But this is what I do believe.
0.0	0.4400664817	And I'm glad that I have a chance to answer this question.
0.0	0.465479352466	And not just green cards.
0.0	0.481901407803	It comes from the right, from the left, from people on all sides of the political spectrum.
0.0	0.458168706884	Because most of the time, they're absolutely correct.
0.0	0.403001681932	I win.
0.0	0.461609507563	I'm worried about bankrupting the American people.
0.0	0.484600133686	You remember Obama a year ago, Yemen was a great victory.
0.0	0.478422230712	And, you know, take advantage of the tremendous opportunities in energy that God has given us, not get involved in these little petty arguments.
0.0	0.451609355448	And yes, I was fired over a disagreement in the boardroom.
0.0	0.478847539389	It's one of the biggest problems our country has.
0.0	0.429898753981	All right.
0.0	0.494271881466	And what you'll find is that I led -- helped lead the effort as a member of the House financial committee against Alan Greenspan, against a guy named Bill Clinton, maybe you know him, maybe you don't.
0.0	0.434383889545	What are you going to do for my kids?
0.0	0.469417280305	Those are two leaders that I admire very much.
0.0	0.453377836143	Let me, you know, again, respectfully disagree with Secretary Clinton here.
0.0	0.474236170486	Because criminals don't buy their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.433965932711	Do you know where I'm going, Kevin?
0.0	0.476907491514	And number two, if we find out they're developing a nuclear weapon and we know how to get to it, we're gonna go take it out.
0.0	0.466787663776	We need -- we need somebody -- we need somebody that literally will take this country and make it great again.

0.0	0.412868148225	They think they are.
0.0	0.484194251657	That is principally an American-led air campaign that we are now engaged in.
0.0	0.439448514279	I'm not fighting that.
0.0	0.481426816527	Now, this takes, David, 18 months to 24 months, two years.
0.0	0.5	I also propose that we can pay for this with a tax on high volume trades and we need to because my dad came to college after World War II on a G.I.
0.0	0.392877911014	Look--

0.0	0.44648412435	I will tell you that.
0.0	0.458650849499	John, I'd like to address this?
0.0	0.482141944792	Well, I think it's perfectly fair to say that we invested quite a bit in development aid.
0.0	0.321389529923	Thank you.

0.0	0.425809474591	That was a terrible mistake.
0.0	0.477645989814	The CEOs of large multinationals may like Hillary.

0.0	0.5	And if I am elected president, to every soldier and sailor and airman and marine, and to every police officer and firefighter and first responder who risk their lives to keep us safe, I will have your back.

0.0	0.475922882088	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.482925451036	But the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, it's to understand what happens the day after.

0.0	0.42997938767	Say again?
0.0	0.486281598318	I saw you on the Senate floor flip your vote on crop insurance because they told you it would help you in Iowa, and last week, we all saw you flip your vote on ethanol in Iowa for the same reason.
0.0	0.430815868371	I like that.
0.0	0.464302755302	Nobody -- I could stand up here all night.

0.0	0.422207733101	And you know what?
0.0	0.487645908145	On day one in the Oval Office, I would make two phone calls.
0.0	0.420152660016	They don't have a clue.
0.0	0.468448951737	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.460435745842	You can go to opensecrets.org and check that.
1.0	0.595957824898	I would note that Art Laffer, Ronald Reagan's chief economic adviser, has written publicly, that my simple flat tax is the best tax plan of any of the individuals on this stage cause it produces economic growth, it raises wages and it helps everyone from the very poorest to the very richest.
0.0	0.468735134359	Just for the record.
0.0	0.5	So, yes, I do believe that when we talk about public education in America, today, in a rapidly changing world, we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities.
0.0	0.483979939579	You've seen middle-class wages go backwards $3,700 during the Obama administration.
0.0	0.459648109474	We must insist on assimilation -- immigration without assimilation is an invasion.
0.0	0.484057938093	So Mexico takes a company, a car company that was going to build in Tennessee, rips it out.
0.0	0.486136334828	It's their time to bail out the middle class, help our kids be able to go to college tuition-free.
0.0	0.5	Obviously, we were distressed when we learned of it, because we have worked very hard -- I said in the beginning of this campaign, we want to reach as many voters as possible, and we have tens of thousands of volunteers doing that, and entering data all the time to keep up with what people are telling us.
0.0	0.491074667767	You know how much money we spent on polio last year in America?
0.0	0.460557328512	That's the difference between China's leaders and our leaders.
0.0	0.455422576477	And we can no longer continue to sweep it under the rug.
0.0	0.479452243606	If these are the kinds of people -- we should use our best and our finest.
0.0	0.473700884356	So this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle.
0.0	0.482851501098	I know that you now have your data back, and that there has been an agreement for an independent inquiry into what did happen.
0.0	0.465805283753	And you should hope that our next president is someone that is influence by their faith.
0.0	0.44737872725	And we will be strong again.
0.0	0.5	We have to put the personnel on that border in the right places; you have to put the strategic fencing in place; and you have to have aviation assets that fly all the way from Tijuana to El Paso to Brownsville, Texas -- 1,933 miles looking down 24/7, with the technology to be able to identify what individuals are doing, and ID when they are in obviously illegal activities or suspicious activities, and quick response teams come.
0.0	0.403348133973	You once had a pension.
0.0	0.486932472791	And it bothers me very much that, rather than working on this issue to resolve it, it has become many press releases from the Clinton campaign later.
0.0	0.469532936857	And I think we've got to be really thoughtful about how we're going to afford what we proposed, which is why everything that I have proposed I will tell you exactly how I'm going to pay for it; including college.
0.0	0.444892822281	But what's wrong is your premise in the question.
0.0	0.463567893422	Number one, we're really good.
0.0	0.477955398154	So, we are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we have to root out in our society.
0.0	0.321389529923	Thank you.
0.0	0.472487155891	But I recall when Secretary Clinton ran against then-Senator Obama, she was critical of him for suggesting that maybe you want to talk to Iran, that you want to talk to our enemies.
0.0	0.472713535277	We've been struggling to get this done since Harry Truman.
0.0	0.465600459264	They beat us all the time.
0.0	0.466755820625	And it's impossible for our people here to compete.
0.0	0.410138393004	But it will be...
0.0	0.414835510659	Bill.
0.0	0.440161661523	So I want to tell you this story.
0.0	0.453984149268	And I do carry on occasion, sometimes a lot.
0.0	0.467641716943	And I make a lot more than the average American.
0.0	0.480834894743	First thing I'd tell the American people, whatever it takes to defend our nation, I would do.
0.0	0.481369553897	You know, no public policy doesn't have, in some cases, negative consequences.
0.0	0.484456692521	And she and I looked at the same evidence coming from the Bush administration regarding Iraq.
0.0	0.469689470788	Yeah (ph), no, I think that's a -- that's a huge mistake, to be closing down mosques.
0.0	0.452010732394	That's what he talked about, the great threat of China.
0.0	0.483808645828	Because they're recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees.
0.0	0.490393630044	And now they see Hillary Clinton proposing a third term of economic policy for our country.
0.0	0.464658096812	Barack Obama wants America to be more like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.473655100314	I am a conservative; I can win this job, I can do this job, I need your help, I need your support.
1.0	0.436183078187	I didn't have an involvement with them.
1.0	0.5	And may I point out that under Ronald Reagan's first term, the highest marginal rate was 70 percent.
0.0	0.475392514828	... and I know Bernie, and I can promise you he's not going to be president of the United States.
0.0	0.462005224748	So when somebody like Donald Trump and others...
0.0	0.490560675692	Imagine a country where the middle class can get rising income again.
0.0	0.482509363389	It's called the value added tax.
0.0	0.471178770084	We can triple the border patrol.
0.0	0.462102674722	We can re-assume our role in the world.
0.0	0.482463788195	We don't have procurement being done for refreshing the equipment.
0.0	0.455672658668	I will not take advice from Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.5	And the net result is the middle class has $2,300 less in their pockets than the day that Barack Obama got elected president.
0.0	0.460543626986	Well, the deal was done.
0.0	0.469710406386	Number -- and that is important for you to know.
0.0	0.461711723107	And I think that's a bad idea for the following reason.
0.0	0.488369107661	So, I think it's absolutely wrong policy for us to be even imagining we're going end up putting tens of thousands of American troops into Syria and Iraq to fight ISIS.
0.0	0.5	Part of the problem that we have currently in the Middle East is that Assad has hung on to power with the very strong support of Russia and Iran and with the proxy of Hezbollah being there basically fighting his battles.
0.0	0.473040837017	Liberty thrives when government is small.
0.0	0.477175958998	Secondly, I don't believe in free tuition for everybody.
0.0	0.430649392952	I don't care.
0.0	0.47501542872	They are anxious on a number of levels.
0.0	0.4931521731	It was our money, and we brought them back to tend to the mentally ill. Because I don't think they ought to live in prison or live under a bridge; to treat the drug-addicted so they're not in an in-and-out-of- the-door policy out of the prisons; and to help the working poor so they don't live in emergency rooms.
0.0	0.477997533272	As a nation, we have to embrace this moment and make our departments more open, more transparent, and more accountable.
0.0	0.427653066064	There's the establishment lane, the anti- establishment lane, and then there's the Kasich lane.
0.0	0.484337116656	How do we utilize our intellect rather than allowing the government to use its, quote, "intellect," in order to help us to be able to live healthier and better lives?
0.0	0.487465589521	Well, for a start it means that police officers should not be shooting unarmed people, predominantly African-Americans.
0.0	0.465708714938	And yet that's the kind of mindset that you need to make this country great again.
0.0	0.481491795091	I am not asking Wall Street or the billionaires for money.
0.0	0.45678864351	Somebody said, "Oh, that's crass."
0.0	0.487078554007	When we saw the breach two months, we didn't go running to the media and make a big deal about it.
0.0	0.454529236353	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.46698421571	We have to stop the money flow.
0.0	0.475993209314	If this country that does not keep its promise to seniors then what promise can this country hope to be trusted to keep?
0.0	0.476114860973	That means we have to work more closely with our great tech companies.
0.0	0.45929936753	I've prosecuted terrorists.
0.0	0.463479398463	Now, he's doing better.
0.0	0.417253515051	He's a bad negotiator.
0.0	0.483575717653	There's a reason Gun Owners of America has endorsed me in this race.
0.0	0.484531627648	You know, I've supported legislation to allow body cameras.
0.0	0.481451162739	That is what this debate is all about, and I would suggest let's stay focused on those issues -- rather than just attacks directed at each other.
0.0	0.437454882502	But here's the best solution of all.
0.0	0.487680454447	The increasing globalization without any real safety valve for people to have a better life.
0.0	0.487427998509	But all of my career, you know, having been raised in -- by a mailman father whose father was a coal miner, who died of black lung and was losing his eyesight; or a mother whose mother could barely speak English.
0.0	0.463407845846	But we're always looking for ways about what more we can do to try to give people a chance to be successful.
0.0	0.409579584442	That's really nice.
0.0	0.468107489789	Well, I don't know about the GOP messaging, but I can tell you about my messaging.
0.0	0.466550056739	Well, but you changed the -- in the book...
0.0	0.449135821818	Well, thanks for having me.
1.0	0.489688543777	In Florida, we have the lowest in-state tuition of any state, because there's accountability, just as John said.
0.0	0.3224134953	That's the negotiator we have.
0.0	0.461379453108	Two quick responses.
0.0	0.47380919982	I think that sets us apart from a lot of what's happening right now on the Republican side.
0.0	0.465257370744	I'm meeting with three of them in the next week.
0.0	0.482167029072	People have invested a lot of energy into that.
0.0	0.483801809342	They are more likely to know what's happening in their families and their communities, and they need to feel not just invited, but welcomed within the American society.
0.0	0.48988441342	I guess the one I -- I would pick is the fact that I was part of a very small group that had to advise the president about whether or not to go after Bin Laden.
0.0	0.413041604625	They're right about that, but I'm doing it.
0.0	0.446142080568	Martha, if I may...
0.0	0.459050125999	Our vets have been abandoned.
0.0	0.494840093473	But nobody can deny that as a wartime leader, he rallied the British people when they stood virtually alone against the Nazi juggernaut and rallied them and eventually won an extraordinary victory.
0.0	0.471526195577	Freedom is personal for me, and I will always keep my word and fight for freedom.
0.0	0.471248327147	For the people who say we can't do it, I say hell no, we can do it together.
0.0	0.436796814441	Jared (ph), Laura and Eric, I'm very proud of my family.
1.0	0.577429631997	Everybody voted for it wanting to see Libya move toward democracy, of course we all wanted to do that.
0.0	0.452623959472	I very much appreciate that comment, Bernie.
0.0	0.477585883614	I cautioned about a quick overthrow of Mubarak, and we now are back with basically an army dictatorship.
0.0	0.453577190915	That's fair game but that's where I'm going to focus.
0.0	0.491946359777	What I am very happy in this campaign that we have had rallies with tens of thousands of people, mostly young people.
0.0	0.426643165927	Your question was you have disagreed...
0.0	0.493181730603	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.481153059608	Guns, in and of themselves, in my opinion, will not make Americans safer.
0.0	0.429898753981	Right.
0.0	0.446272280674	This is our time and our opportunity to do that.
0.0	0.485521194547	Jeb Bush, why have your numbers fallen?
0.0	0.464656697669	I'd suggest people take a look at it.
0.0	0.474082158387	And the world, no doubt is a better place without him.
0.0	0.453860991844	And now I'm building all over the world, and I love what I'm doing.
0.0	0.46812657364	The issue now is do we break them ?up do we reestablish Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.420137533402	... Chris, your questions that you...
0.0	0.482029942259	I think what our campaign is indicating is that the American people are tired of establishment politics, tired of establishment economics.
0.0	0.484141862752	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.454127676875	She never lived to see that.
0.0	0.490420650968	We should be deporting criminals, not hardworking immigrant families who do the very best they can and often are keeping economies going in many places in our country.
0.0	0.453901924542	And that's what i hope, there can be some understanding and cooperation to achieve.
0.0	0.486288915937	That they were going to have to hire 20,000 new IRS agencies to collect it.
0.0	0.441666878343	I really thought that he would be a great cheerleader.
0.0	0.460858337274	You get the Congress, you get the Senate, you get together, you do legislation.
0.0	0.458486691702	You have a big lawsuit over your head while you're running.
0.0	0.494434231085	What Reagan did is he began with tax reform and regulatory reform, unleashing the engine of the American free enterprise system.
0.0	0.469107369427	I think it's a wonderful that that businesses start a 401(k).
0.0	0.451486837517	They've got to be broken up.
0.0	0.486791769435	You know, we can't -- if we're not going to send American troops, which there was never any idea of doing that, then to try to send trainers, to try to send experts, is something we offered, Europeans offered, the U.N. offered, and there wasn't a lot of responsiveness at first.
0.0	0.491610685964	After I'm called by 30 friends of mine who contributed to different campaigns, after I'm called by all of the special interests and by the -- the donors and by the lobbyists -- and they have zero chance at convincing me, zero -- I'll get a call the next day from the head of Ford.
0.0	0.491984352382	Well first of all, I think it's important that when we're running for the highest office in the land that we recognize that we're living in dangerous times and we have to be serious about it, that our words have consequences.
0.0	0.465257913889	I'd sign that executive order.
0.0	0.492565019778	Why are there five even bigger Wall Street banks now, instead of the ten we used to have on Wall Street?
0.0	0.460507559531	So Ford will come back.
0.0	0.45430751283	So one of the things I did, and I said, you know what I'll do.
0.0	0.468559043045	If you want someone who's not going to divide Washington, but gets things done, then you should make me your president.
0.0	0.463988748111	But I just have to tell you that it's best with some of these things not be said.
0.0	0.485400188356	Why don't we just give a chicken in every pot, while we're, you know, coming up -- coming up with these fantasy tax schemes.
0.0	0.474626549905	Marco leaves the IRS code in with all of the complexity.
0.0	0.485827175976	So this is the new type of threats that we're facing and we need to lead as a nation in confronting it and putting together new alliances and new coalitions.
0.0	0.5	John, the world is a very dangerous place, but the world is not too dangerous of a place for the United States of America, provided we act according to our principles, provided we act intelligently.
0.0	0.483644727559	You've got to work with local communities and you've got to work with the federal government.
0.0	0.462393419951	It's not the evil rich people.
0.0	0.457775833941	David, let me give you a little bit of background here.
0.0	0.426191413852	Oh, great.
0.0	0.463561261525	This mandatory sentencing, a very bad idea.
0.0	0.413616956094	He's wrong.
0.0	0.468623322574	But I know that we offered a lot of help and I know it was difficult for the Libyans to accept help.
0.0	0.465766190823	And I was on the front lines of that, looking into the eyes of my neighbors...
0.0	0.431216782049	Go ahead.
0.0	0.5	A 100, 150 years ago incredibly brave Americans said, you know what, working class kids, low income kids should not have to work in factories or on the farms.
0.0	0.482258148929	I'll tell them that we're going to grow the economy so that we can give people better opportunities so they don't have to rely exclusively on benefit types of programs.
0.0	0.437103696488	So Hillary and I have a difference.
0.0	0.489009593444	We also reduced incarceration rates to 20-year lows.
0.0	0.478753143857	You have no disposable income when you are make 10, 12 bucks an hour.
0.0	0.486329022531	In terms of Wall Street, I respectfully disagree with you, madam secretary, in the sense that the issue here is when you have such incredible power and such incredible wealth.
0.0	0.485143281587	Because of a series of disastrous trade policies which have allowed corporate America through NAFTA and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, Secretary Clinton and I disagree on those issues.
0.0	0.487140196314	We can get back in the game to restore order and security for our own country.
0.0	0.462319138213	I lead the opposition against it.
0.0	0.411726076027	Where are you gonna clean it up?
0.0	0.48069437156	We're closing hospitals, we're closing wards, we're closing so many because the states want to save money.
0.0	0.434871634945	Or somebody else.
0.0	0.4729839406	And we're going to be proud every month for the rest of our lives.
0.0	0.482629590373	So John, there's a big difference between leading by polls and leading with principle.
0.0	0.375354588142	There is no other description of it.
0.0	0.5	In fact, American consumers pay the highest prices in the world for drugs that we help to be developed through the National Institute of Health and that we then tested through the FDA.
0.0	0.47459472219	We don't need to raise taxes to get this done.
0.0	0.484748300888	I think one of the heroes in a real quagmire out there, in a dangerous and difficult world, one of the heroes who we should recognize in the Middle East is King Abdullah II of Jordan.
0.0	0.483609539688	How about Obamacare, a certified job killer?
0.0	0.476713650832	And as it relates to all the other organizations, let me give you a good example.
0.0	0.412868148225	I think we should do both.
0.0	0.471370012426	You know, everybody says every election's important, and there's truth to that.
0.0	0.453688319328	People aren't dumb.
0.0	0.460191155524	If I have a weakness, it's that I try to live by the rules.
0.0	0.456106508533	And that's why Monday night, what will happen here in Iowa is so important.
0.0	0.383077601592	And that's what I intend to do.
0.0	0.456296936934	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.484194439666	If we -- if we don't act now, we are going to be the first generation in American history that leaves our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.46980295752	... do I go -- let me go first, and then you can please recognize Rand after.
0.0	0.49227510659	He's missing the whole point, that America's leadership in the world is required for peace and stability.
0.0	0.455189077894	And I think that's the false choice...
0.0	0.482693569778	We hear all this discussion about well, I would do this, or I would do that, when the fact is, the border is still porous.
0.0	0.471378794971	The only reason why you're doing it now is because we're running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.
0.0	0.471009178453	The people don't work for us.
0.0	0.453684010973	I mean, Chris will know about that.
0.0	0.473278772224	And that's why, as president, I will look at communities that need special help and try to deliver that.
0.0	0.465036762198	And there is no reason that you can't be perfectly fair to the gay community.
0.0	0.475176211532	I think, actually, people are looking for that in Washington now.
0.0	0.487361582691	But we have to restore policing that will actually protect the communities that police officers are sworn to protect.
0.0	0.5	And I used to say it, there are ships at sea, and this was during the worst crisis, that were loaded up with oil, and the cartel kept the price up, because, again, they were smarter than our leaders.
0.0	0.477169367799	And Dulce Candy -- a pretty cool name, actually -- that is now an entrepreneur over Youtube is part of that American spirit, and we should celebrate it as conservatives.
1.0	0.591773922407	Under longstanding U.S. law, the child of a U.S. citizen born abroad is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.5	And, sometimes we're held up in contempt by people who write columns, but, I guarantee you to every person on this stage there's something deep inside of us that would cause us to give up our livelihoods and step out on this stage and fight for the people of America.
0.0	0.5	And it's probably not going to happen until we have real campaign finance reform and get rid of all these superpacs, and the power of the insurance companies and the drug companies.
0.0	0.427787736225	But the facts are simple.
0.0	0.476013429718	And they will work with me to get comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.482470925302	That is the fight we have to have, and we have to undo a whole set of things that President Obama has done that get at the heart of his disrespect and disregard for too many Americans.
0.0	0.461180105281	So let's focus on what this election is really going to be about.
0.0	0.451284081642	Whoever heard of this?
0.0	0.479780427736	Let's don't use the term 'boots on the ground'.
0.0	0.480439294947	We grew up in a three-and-a-half-room, rent controlled apartment in Brooklyn, New York.
0.0	0.474874615936	... family leave for a very long time...
0.0	0.469245615291	We have to find out -- many people knew about what was going on.
0.0	0.474623010267	They can solve the problem of North Korea if they wanted to but they taunt us.
0.0	0.466001580611	They are going to have to take on ISIS.
0.0	0.526597510833	It is.
0.0	0.43329662532	It's coming from more than Mexico.
0.0	0.477305826579	And I had commitments to be at a town hall in New Hampshire.
0.0	0.477308279866	They don't believe in building walls and a pessimistic view of the future.
0.0	0.480376064433	The point I'm making is this, the Federal Government should not be in a lot of things.
0.0	0.456208357907	I was a child of Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.455610895884	I would call up the head of Ford, who I know.
0.0	0.446101663975	That is why we need to make...
0.0	0.474139386616	I've heard a lot about me in this debate, and I'm going to keep talking and thinking about all of you because ultimately, I think the president's job is to do everything possible, everything that she can do to lift up the people of this country.
0.0	0.459229703879	Well, first of all, thank you all for having us.
0.0	0.444229006263	We don't have victories anymore.
0.0	0.471689231183	No Wall Street executive has been prosecuted.
0.0	0.473880951473	I have a friend who's a doctor, and he said to me the other day, "Donald, I never saw anything like it.
0.0	0.452133550057	I like how you stand up.
0.0	0.4757946054	And to contrast, even -- there are differences among us.
0.0	0.5	I understand both of these issues, how to build the economy and doing that as a governor who'd built jobs, had cut taxes and also a governor who understands foreign-policy, and that's why I entered this race.
0.0	0.494836271531	Every war you can imaging, we have people at each other's throat and our strength is actually in our unity.
1.0	0.4745398348	And I have liabilities of about $500 million (ph).
1.0	0.620454857101	Our military is a disaster.
0.0	0.48131308608	I do believe that people who are trying to come to the United States -- this country has a right to know who they are and why they are coming.
0.0	0.471891203008	And I was clear about that at the time.
0.0	0.492432396918	John, I was the first person on this stage to say that we should accept the 65,000 Syrian refugees that were fleeing the sort of murder of ISIL, and I believe that that needs to be done with proper screening.
0.0	0.461191648121	You know, Hillary Clinton's always saying how Republicans don't follow science?
0.0	0.457075143738	If that's a blind trust, I don't know.
0.0	0.478982747143	How does that help us?  TRUMP R 15 94 1 N Where is that good?
0.0	0.465937885956	This is the only time I've had a chance, let me finish.
0.0	0.5	So it is possible actually, to find the things that actually work, that we did, increasing drug treatment, using big data to better protect the lives of young people, cut juvenile crime in half, and it's also possible to improve how we police our police.
0.0	0.490723081409	On September 11, my wife was two blocks from the World Trade Center.
0.0	0.444418243237	Barack Obama wants to change America.
0.0	0.441177756537	But we have a serious problem.
0.0	0.511014557353	We're spending over $600 billion a year on the military and yet, significantly less than 10 percent of that money is used to be fighting international terrorism.
0.0	0.489608893331	They've contacted the trafficking networks in the Western Hemisphere to get people in through the southern border.
0.0	0.446756938347	That was not, as I understand it, the secretary's position.
0.0	0.483144285149	But everything will be filed eventually with the government, and we don't extensions or anything.
0.0	0.469223674683	The secretary is right: Our people are fearful.
0.0	0.482477551664	We need to address our security issues, we need to address the economic issues around the kitchen table.
0.0	0.470958125417	We have to provide financial support to them.
0.0	0.459436763957	They like to ask direct questions.
0.0	0.48616666484	Now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world.
0.0	0.476562262354	That can be done without profiling people.
0.0	0.454587576254	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.451967725645	My patients are beside themselves.
0.0	0.475093996451	It's a divided country on guns.
0.0	0.414492961706	We overcame the NRA's objections.
0.0	0.457919853714	They've got nothing but money.
0.0	0.439356904251	It should be what are your substantive positions...
0.0	0.438337573734	Republicans and Democrats alike believe this.
0.0	0.482658844589	And we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid.
0.0	0.474144697321	We need a leader that will fix things and have a proven record to do it.
0.0	0.460574926104	I think they're more interested in what we have to say about all the big issues facing us.
0.0	0.488115705491	And if we do not get our act together and listen to what the scientists say, you're going to see countries all over the world -- this is what the CIA says -- they're going to be struggling over limited amounts of water, limited amounts of land to grow their crops ask you're going to see all kinds of international conflict.
0.0	0.42904003504	Maybe you haven't.
0.0	0.493161665519	So, yes, I do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white Americans -- particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have -- you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is.
0.0	0.5	At that particular point in time, then Americans will believe that Washington is up to a conversation to deal with the millions of people that are here illegally, but not until.
0.0	0.441891415661	Might I respond?
0.0	0.481951890301	If I am president of the United States, we're going to send soldiers back to Iraq, back to Syria, to keep us from being attacked here and keep soldiers in Afghanistan because we must.

0.0	0.463755409618	You learn to constantly evaluate and understand the nature of the threats that you are being faced with.
0.0	0.478371080291	They need to be defeated militarily, and that will take overwhelming U.S. force.
0.0	0.473832149641	I sent a boat over and they actually sent it back.
0.0	0.484883930513	But I certainly think that the United States should take its full responsibility in helping those people.
0.0	0.489297324718	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the free enterprise system.
0.0	0.480773761193	Well, John, I come from the '60s, a long time ago.
0.0	0.482145808059	...10% flat rate...
0.0	0.486457771328	Manufacturing will flow back into this country.
0.0	0.488367508166	You know, just two weeks ago was the 25th anniversary of the first Persian Gulf war.
0.0	0.439226607114	We need more principle.
0.0	0.46618827705	And you combine that with reforms of our welfare system.
0.0	0.466359342387	So this man tells me about the manufacturing.
0.0	0.442501800325	And I ask you to join me in truth and honesty and integrity.
0.0	0.475825960455	Well, you need somebody, because politicians are all talk, no action.
0.0	0.479469504781	This is money that people have confiscated out of their paychecks.
0.0	0.46899229583	And, I can tell, some of the candidates, they went in.
1.0	0.567440837707	It looked like very few women.
0.0	0.474949091728	We have to repeal Obamacare, and it can be -- and -- and it can be replaced with something much better for everybody.
1.0	0.62142611845	The cost of college education is escalating a lot faster than the cost of inflation.
0.0	0.383157735752	It is not a suggestion.
0.0	0.473715721314	First statement is, we tell the billionaire class, "they cannot have it all."
0.0	0.473899982903	We have got to destroy their training camps and recruiting centers.
0.0	0.486088536554	And this is one of the myths that the left perpetrates on our society, and this is how they frighten people and get people to shut up.
0.0	0.485251217824	Our country deserves no less, because all of the other issues we want to deal with depend upon us being secure and strong.
0.0	0.492164102489	At the end of the day, if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, and the governor makes a good point about trade, anti-trade, anti-monopoly activities.
0.0	0.482571155674	And the fact of the matter is if we give them a mission and we don't tie their hands behind their back, they can get it accomplished.
0.0	0.5	And I was determined to do everything that I could to make VA health care the best in the world, to expand benefits to the men and women who put their lives on the line to defending.
0.0	0.445394263822	A brief response.
0.0	0.469879349723	I think the times are much more serious.
0.0	0.467514816542	Germany, many other countries do it already.
0.0	0.464299753991	We both made the identical promises.
0.0	0.474897948874	Nobody, nobody will be pushing us around.
0.0	0.456240030941	And then, of course, 9/11 happened, which happened before there was an invasion of Iraq.
0.0	0.485875792089	And sadly, in America today, in our economy, a whole lot of those poor people are African-American.
0.0	0.484117110294	We need the lawyers(ph) off the back of the war fighters.
0.0	0.486002720121	Now, there is a difference between personal insults and attacks -- between going into the mud with ad hominems and focusing on issues and substance.
0.0	0.475265361996	And Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will say it's those evil rich people.
0.0	0.451425924012	Too often, they give up, they negotiate with themselves.
0.0	0.479863423328	Number one...
0.0	0.472630092412	He might be on one of my courses.
0.0	0.482421897187	When was the last time anybody saw us beating, let's say, China in a trade deal?
0.0	0.483476044989	We've enacted it in our state.
0.0	0.449850160664	You know, maybe they're dumb and they don't know what they're going to get, but I don't think so.
0.0	0.462770147754	You know why three?
0.0	0.486095632503	But what happened at the university there, what's happening at other universities, I think reflects the deep sense of, you know, concern, even despair that so many young people, particularly of color, have...
0.0	0.48363976809	We have a president of the United States that is undermining this country's security and expanding the role of...
0.0	0.450328508563	That's what I've always stood for.
0.0	0.5	And I give Senator Sanders a lot of credit for really lighting a fire under many people -- young, old, everybody -- who sees a chance to be involved and have their voice heard.
0.0	0.485623599846	Now you are a worker, white worker, black worker, who had a decent job, that manufacturing job is gone.
0.0	0.482128406008	The deployments are too high for the military personnel.
0.0	0.464258145982	When -- when we put all the facts down, you'll be able to see that it's not true, it works out very well.
0.0	0.463213478876	I think he has addressed a lot of these issues that have been quite difficult, but he has gone forward.
0.0	0.452505418765	And Ben, you're a terrible surgeon.
0.0	0.462894835748	... and when I'm president, we are keeping ISIS out of America.
0.0	0.4610968672	The talk has got to stop, the action has got to begin.
0.0	0.476629891852	So the federal solution would be the Life at Conception act which is an act that would federalize the issue.
0.0	0.473017037004	As it relates to the super PACs, I have no control over that.
0.0	0.406184627426	And that's not what we did in Maryland.
0.0	0.5	We have $2.5 trillion outside of the United States which we want to bring back in.
1.0	0.60392591341	The average middle-class family will be saving thousands of dollars a year.
0.0	0.429482801055	They all have jobs.
0.0	0.452761814363	I think that's a major accomplishment.
0.0	0.5	That's why I'm running for office because when I become president of the United States, on my first day in office we are going to repeal every single one of his unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.457377916955	Let me put those proposals-- and you're absolutely right.
0.0	0.438161750592	That is absolutely not right.
0.0	0.466708064295	Actually a close friend.
0.0	0.449322000216	I'm just saying.
0.0	0.477394320069	The majority of people in American actually have values and principles and they believe in the very things that made America great.
0.0	0.49091185189	Target the efforts for people that are committing crimes with guns, and if you do that, and get it right, you're going to be much better off than creating a political argument where there's a big divide.
0.0	0.473974677397	And the reason why this war against them is so important is that very basis of religious liberty.
0.0	0.466169548215	And they don't buy their guns from a gun store.
0.0	0.5	We need to solve problems, we need to rebuild our military so we can stand up to radical Islam, we need to get our economy growing much faster by throwing out the corrupt tax code and lowering the rates.
0.0	0.487849262329	But yes, there is more collaboration required between private sector companies and the public sector.
0.0	0.452169767877	My background is different.
0.0	0.425649302147	You're right.
0.0	0.5	We inherited a system that was set up during World War II; 170 million Americans get health insurance right now through their employers.
0.0	0.44991641015	I want this bill to be voted down.
0.0	0.490708042414	Well, first off, let's face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.479059973847	That is some group of people.
0.0	0.487850193246	But I think this is a worldwide -- that the entire world needs to come together to deal with this horrific refugee crisis we're seeing from Syria and Afghanistan, as well.
0.0	0.494566435426	So as a nation we need to increase what we invest in Pell grants.
0.0	0.402210566017	It has to be dealt with.
0.0	0.47881367069	And I wrote a book about this called Immigration Wars.
0.0	0.479531452906	We have people that have no incentive to work.
0.0	0.467943772555	Actually, I'd love to get you to build a wall.
0.0	0.483643926981	The billionaire and the working man, no hedge fund manager pays less than his secretary.
0.0	0.476636319551	I have a way to pay for it that actually makes the wealthiest pay for it...
0.0	0.45063130856	I mean, you know, let's not be naive about it.
0.0	0.465238096019	They come up to my office.
0.0	0.470495063566	But you know, we don't want to put everybody in the same category.
1.0	0.58919033336	What those facts knew was that these folks had weapons.
0.0	0.470570240937	But somehow for decades, nothing really has changed.
0.0	0.429898753981	All right.
0.0	0.482629477355	As you know, he came to Vermont to campaign for me when he was a senator.
0.0	0.467663958462	And -- and -- you know, it goes back to the whole concept of regulations, which are in everything.
0.0	0.5	States need to stop cutting higher education, and we should create a new block grant program that keeps the states' skin in the game, and we should lower these outrageous interest rates that parents and kids are being charged by their own government.
0.0	0.484603880624	He's got probably a four or five percent chance.
0.0	0.453623313035	There's a big question mark on your head.
0.0	0.48315986372	People have been paying it for years.
0.0	0.412868148225	I think what is...
0.0	0.46966842949	I think God has blessed this country with enormous natural resources, and we should pursue all of the above.
0.0	0.468724524952	And if I am president and we get our hands on him, he is standing trial for treason.
0.0	0.440750372276	They don't know what they're doing.
0.0	0.466120283538	So now ISIS has the oil, and what they don't have, Iran has.
0.0	0.478417591728	It's a simple flat tax for everyone.
0.0	0.467836996978	And that's what we have= representing us.
0.0	0.470202247402	And -- and -- and the last piece of this, Maria, is this.
0.0	0.463614612342	We have the U.N. Security Council adopting a resolution that lays out a transition path.
0.0	0.526597510833	Not -- not on that, no.
0.0	0.471795794316	We need to be on the side that keeps Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.470296443904	Why didn't they turn those two people in so that you wouldn't have had all the death?
0.0	0.4826753046	Or how about Boeing right here within a mile?
0.0	0.435886398542	You want me to answer that question?
0.0	0.455923041641	Maria, I assume that I can respond to that.
0.0	0.443724592799	I've gotten to do some incredible things.
0.0	0.478760247573	Of course we have to raise the minimum wage.
0.0	0.434096876033	We didn't spend any.
0.0	0.437096966245	They haven't done that.
0.0	0.487251477243	He appointed Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, someone who has been a radical against the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.
0.0	0.486737171642	We can create a situation for our children to be able to get a decent job to pay down their college debt.
0.0	0.483267689682	We should make women third-class citizens, that we should allow children to be sexually assaulted, that they are a danger to modern society.
0.0	0.464279034591	They are trying to attack us here in America.
0.0	0.47790919198	And also, I've been tested in a way no one else has.
0.0	0.441043793457	Please reconsider, I'll say no.
0.0	0.5	You just see the recent deal announced today or yesterday, more spending, more tax increasing, more regulation.
0.0	0.478379945354	Simply expanding Medicaid does not improve health care outcomes.
0.0	0.455714376357	It needs to be repealed and replaced.
1.0	0.602986248504	But as you've indicated for millions of American workers, people in New Hampshire -- all over America, they're working longer hours for lower wages deeply worried about their kids.
0.0	0.454388251362	Now we hear the tough talk.
0.0	0.482497810429	And for 30 years, the issue of immigration has been about someone who's in this country, maybe they're here illegally, but they're looking for a job.
0.0	0.470668689396	You would say maybe two, maybe four?
0.0	0.461749010663	A bipartisan approach got close.
0.0	0.492309244316	And I would note the other individuals on this stage were nowhere to be found in that fight.
0.0	0.494163030777	As I said before, we are a land of immigrants, but we have to be intelligent about the way that we form our immigration policies, and that's one of the reasons that I have called on us to declare war on the Islamic State because we need to reorient our immigration policies and our visa policies for people who are coming into this country because there are many people out there who want to destroy us.
0.0	0.48710911431	In fact, one of the big banks came to me and said, "Donald, you don't have enough borrowings.
0.0	0.477512513388	And right now, I will be putting up a tremendous -- so far, I've put up less than anybody and I have the best results.
0.0	0.45066674638	But you don't hear that from anybody else.
0.0	0.464543561864	I just don't think it would get the job done.
0.0	0.437350010067	You get a lot of them that are overrated.
0.0	0.5	We cannot fix things in this country -- the Social Security, the border, balancing the budget, getting wages to grow faster -- unless we lead as conservatives, but we also invite people in from the other party.
0.0	0.470494409277	I'm very proud that NARAL endorsed me because when it comes to it we need a leader on women's issues.
0.0	0.463567677546	So I said, "That's OK." I'm proud of my net worth.
0.0	0.436877817648	It is Iran that's the expansionist power.
0.0	0.5	I would just say, I debated then Senator Obama numerous times on stages like this, and he was the recipient of the largest number of Wall Street donations of anybody running on the Democratic side ever.
0.0	0.481178563193	They said they would repeal Obamacare if we gave them the majority.
0.0	0.481570573288	I can't speak for the Koch Brothers, you're referring to a Super PAC that we don't coordinate with, that was set up to support President Obama, that has now decided that they want to support me.
0.0	0.5	We haven't come up with an exact number yet, but it will not be as high as the number under Dwight D. Eisenhower, which was 90 percent.
0.0	0.451072398555	Let me just...
0.0	0.436760924624	They have infrastructure.
0.0	0.482108173344	I think the United States military is operating under rules of engagement that are too strict...
0.0	0.481923980292	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, it is demonstrably true...
0.0	0.474861024619	But we also need to reform Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.457758132087	And we have to lead, if we're going to be successful.
0.0	0.44508772156	We want to build on it and fix it.
0.0	0.412411103324	But I know who the pessimist is.
0.0	0.446736009922	I think I'm actually a very nice person."
0.0	0.489754685653	And we are going to be able to defeat ISIS on the ground there, as well as in this world, because of the Muslim Americans in our country and throughout the world who understand that this brutal and barbaric group is perverting the name of a great world religion.
0.0	0.441940154207	May I respond?
0.0	0.47174226069	But you haven't asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought I'd get that off my chest if you don't mind.
0.0	0.471784751914	She put America's secrets at risk for her convenience.
0.0	0.489575870081	If you look at the numbers, there are actually as many, if not more white communities that are truly being left behind and left out.
0.0	0.444156702768	Secretary Clinton is right.
0.0	0.488238682001	Last I heard, a United States senator had the right to disagree with the president, including a president who has done such an extraordinary job.
0.0	0.4739480571	But the good news is the next commander-in-chief is standing on this stage.
0.0	0.492276578616	We don't need Hillary Clinton's price controls for -- again, does anybody out there think that giving Washington, D.C., the opportunity to run the pharmaceutical industry is a good idea, given how well they have done running the government?
0.0	0.5	I want the Buffett Rule to be in effect, where millionaires have to pay 30 percent tax rates instead of 10 percent to nothing in some cases.
0.0	0.426071298049	I will be ready.
0.0	0.422301430922	Yes.
0.0	0.47969294544	I mean, literally, the Senate -- what is it, like a French work week?
0.0	0.468520110203	I was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came.
0.0	0.474746158023	We could turn off that spigot by charging them tax until they behave properly.
0.0	0.464597031965	So, yes, this has developed.
0.0	0.422301430922	Yes.
0.0	0.457581286483	I never said that.
1.0	0.61977335899	And, it says blanket amnesty, I do not support blanket amnesty...
0.0	0.408800517277	That's the difference.
0.0	0.48873950348	King Abdullah of Jordan, a man I've known for a long time, has been asking for bombs and materiel.
0.0	0.459545374016	Here's the deal, Chris is totally right.
0.0	0.493152141658	I've had the growth code (ph) there for about five years, and it's this specific program.
0.0	0.490101874449	And by the way, it's not just on immigration, you used to support TPA, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.432647827661	What a brilliant idea that would be.
0.0	0.456215513266	What have you got now?
0.0	0.462340445762	He doesn't want to hear the talk about politics Megyn and who is establishment and who is grassroots.
0.0	0.488972123355	I think THAT you can talk about Islamists who clearly are also jihadists, but I think it's not particularly helpful to make the case that Senator Sanders was just making that I agree with, that we've got to reach out to Muslim countries.
0.0	0.5	I've spent my entire life, since I started as a young lawyer for the Children's Defense Fund, trying to figure out how we can even the odds for so many people in America, this great country of ours, who are behind, who don't have a chance.
0.0	0.470824425897	So I want to explain why this is not in America's interest to react with this kind of fear and respond to this sort of bigotry.
0.0	0.489954830795	Here's my promise, at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country.
0.0	0.422547814692	I have a wonderful family.
0.0	0.5	And I want us to be absolutely clear about making sure the insurance companies in the private employer policy arena as well as in the Affordable Care exchanges are properly regulated so that we are not being gamed.
0.0	0.484087605929	We need to use our technological advantages, because what we've warned of is an international guerrilla movement that threatens this country.
0.0	0.45975317405	It's why you see the banks consolidating.
0.0	0.46340902276	If somebody put me on their homepage, they did it without my permission.
0.0	0.480689288775	He's actually a negative force.
0.0	0.453664786873	They can't see the government as an adversary, we can't see them as obstructionists.
0.0	0.471276812939	So, you know, again, the difference between us and the Republicans is night and day.
0.0	0.461229686999	Now, I understand that this is very difficult.
0.0	0.464154692984	I will show you what they do to women.
0.0	0.467307959409	And, I think there should be no mandates, and no subsidies whatsoever.
0.0	0.469387755322	Well, first of all, I'm 7 and 0 in my fantasy league.
0.0	0.463856656532	He was unable to answer the question, is Iraq a good thing or bad thing?
0.0	0.412868148225	Think about that.
0.0	0.457482477722	I think we all support that.
0.0	0.479143547647	And I promise I will never be in a bicycle race.
0.0	0.437304815724	They go to Harvard.
0.0	0.461309688649	This isn't -- this isn't, you know, a different kind of job.
0.0	0.5	The wages that high school graduates receive today are significantly less, whether you are white or black, than they used to be.
0.0	0.39847947423	Absolutely.
0.0	0.419907560859	There's give and take.
0.0	0.481135459964	I may not be your dream candidate just yet, but I can assure you I am Hillary Clinton's worst nightmare.
0.0	0.482452140567	We need comprehensive gun safety legislation and a ban on assault weapons.
0.0	0.488241781228	Well, I was pleased that NATO announced just this week that they're going to start doing patrols in the Mediterranean, in the Aegean, to try to interdict the smugglers, to try to prevent the kind of tragedies that we have seen all too often, also to try to prevent more refugees from coming to the European Union.
0.0	0.480356093798	The media noise will soon be over and it's now for the men and women of Iowa to decide.
1.0	0.5	It is a simple flat tax where for individuals, a family of four pays nothing on the first $36,000.
0.0	0.494051542304	And also -- also, what we should be clear about is we end up spending -- and I think the secretary knows this -- far more per capita on health care than any other major country, and our outcomes, health care outcomes are not necessarily that good.
0.0	0.459214743251	And believe me, Assad is not worth it.
0.0	0.489942183022	They are radicalizing people in the United States, they are conducting attacks around the world.
0.0	0.372039130143	No, John.
0.0	0.387550410317	Yeah.
0.0	0.482694410966	... Mr. Trump believed that in reaction to people's fears that we should ban all Muslims.
0.0	0.430645353185	But, we can't rest.
0.0	0.460943649493	And people said "you can't win, you can't change the culture."
0.0	0.488284151374	So I believe that over the next few years, not tomorrow, but over the next few years, we have got to move the minimum wage to a living wage, 15 bucks an hour.
0.0	0.453181095728	They're killing us.
0.0	0.466176921975	Because Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama.
0.0	0.392404892988	David, thank you.
0.0	0.454294164149	You've got to keep asking.
0.0	0.455551939961	They go to Yale.
0.0	0.482024043054	He said, "there's a chill wind blowing through law enforcement in this country."
0.0	0.433775018351	You know, the situation is this.
1.0	0.593504888683	You used to say that you were in favor of birthright citizenship, now you say that you are against it.
0.0	0.474886192725	The time to act is now.
0.0	0.47392756874	You see something that's suspicious, you call law enforcement and let law enforcement make those decisions.
0.0	0.382075856934	I have no illusion.
0.0	0.470373363304	May I offer a different generation's perspective on this?
0.0	0.484509954125	There is no money in the Social Security account.
1.0	0.682552645856	Median wages have stagnated.
0.0	0.461658465774	If you had the court reverse Roe v. Wade, it would become a state issue once again.
0.0	0.464865733199	And let me say this also.
0.0	0.461628232696	... Actually, I was...
0.0	0.439971333113	They do celebrate more dependence on the government.
0.0	0.48576899629	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.479228279299	I would hold a Camp David summit with our Arab allies, not to talk them into this lousy deal with Iran, but to say to them, "what is it that you need to defeat ISIL?"
1.0	0.491128943096	All that's in that trust fund is a pile of IOUs for money they spent on something else a long time ago.
0.0	0.453082878541	You didn't see it for a minute.
0.0	0.468585153141	Government causes a problem, and then government steps in to solve the problem.
0.0	0.486719170725	When it comes to the audit the Fed bill, as Rand knows well, I was an original sponsor of the bill, I'm strongly supportive of it.
0.0	0.466154874283	Well I think a lot of people are understandably reacting out of fear and anxiety about what they're seeing.
0.0	0.443326168758	Then I looked at Rubio.
0.0	0.455695698155	I said, "I don't know."
0.0	0.45794864008	Well, I think it's pretty clear that they know that I will.
0.0	0.487136794236	Let me concur with the secretary, no question women's rights are under fierce attack all over this country.
0.0	0.485103022124	And I agree about the role that he played both in war and in peace on the economy and defeating fascism around the world.
0.0	0.467174127331	And then, most importantly, here at home, I think there are three things that we have to get right.
0.0	0.460211465061	We need to rebuild our families.
0.0	0.454155277251	We're going to let people in, but they're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.461797148391	You can't hide behind parliamentary tricks.
1.0	0.592361762703	We have the world's best military, even though he's done everything he can to diminish it.
0.0	0.476901221208	And I have laid out specific plans -- you can go to my web site, hillaryclinton.com, and read the details.
0.0	0.47937059891	They order planes, they make Boeing build their plant in China.
0.0	0.451072398555	Let me just...
0.0	0.481433079293	And I believe people need a leader who is prepared to make tough calls in tough times and stand up...
0.0	0.480196511614	We elected a president that is weakening America on the global stage.
0.0	0.45607649379	But in addition to that, we have to have fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.465374723794	I know what it's like to owe that money, and we've worked hard.
0.0	0.474202776655	... there was a question about foreign policy, by the way, and experience.
0.0	0.486464271638	And in whatever way the three of us can we need to move this agenda forward and begin to deal with the gun lobby and the intimidation that they present.
1.0	0.598287823019	In those 38 words, it said anyone here illegally is permanently ineligible for citizenship.
0.0	0.5	When he meets with the attorney general in the White House, it's not "how can we protect the Second Amendment rights of Americans."
0.0	0.464199499775	They know it's not a good thing, and they may even be upset by it.
0.0	0.490167019926	We should have a path to legal status for the 12 million people that are here illegally.
0.0	0.452321115624	... replacing dependency with opportunity.
0.0	0.480889856474	They can't -- when they order the product and when they finally get the product it is taxed.
0.0	0.460040393374	And so do I.
0.0	0.486952392047	No radical Islam that is allowed to engage in encouraging violence against Americans, that is not protected speech.
0.0	0.401885403147	Talk about what?
0.0	0.471842175797	So the crisis was I lost what I wanted.
0.0	0.454698030369	We lose, we have a trade imbalance...
0.0	0.48424176039	Focus on the diseases that are costing us the trillions of dollars.
1.0	0.476994303804	It allows President Obama to borrow unlimited amounts of money.
0.0	0.467885529814	But the reason America is a great country, the reason is because our compassion is in our laws.
0.0	0.466356130242	Marco stood with Chuck Schumer and Barack Obama on amnesty.
0.0	0.445246372467	Look, I look at our economy as an ecosystem.
0.0	0.468034012083	But after I said that, we're not hearing so much about Hillary Clinton's e-mails.
0.0	0.475252901104	And, you know, for six-and-a-half years, we've had a gigantic party.
0.0	0.491053547392	Drugs have taken far too many of our citizens.
0.0	0.492094134397	Americans are looking for somebody that's going to give them, and there is a place in this country over the last eight years in particular that talked about hope every day, and they didn't just talk about it, they delivered it.
0.0	0.456084961489	And we also need a cheerleader.
0.0	0.460656259599	The government has lied to you and they have stolen from you.
0.0	0.43271099707	Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, they're no better.
0.0	0.42114403389	We have nothing.
0.0	0.465451486851	Now, Bill, he loves to criticize America, apologize for us, criticize medieval Christians.
0.0	0.459524622275	You're seeing cities like Seattle.
0.0	0.475008440576	The U.S. has become a dumping ground for everybody else's problems.
0.0	0.472231543525	... no, you already had your chance, Marco, and you blew it.
0.0	0.47909618389	this is a clear and present danger in our politics within.
0.0	0.467917655705	First what they saw in Paris, now what they have seen in San Bernardino.
0.0	0.454739732271	We hear actually a lot of good intentions.
0.0	0.484803177388	Yes, in my view, the government of a democratic society has a moral responsibility to play a vital role in making sure all of our people have a decent standard of living.
0.0	0.455100513294	But they can't get along.
0.0	0.526597510833	And why?
0.0	0.417240963776	It's not only a problem here.
0.0	0.453261085975	You know, America doesn't owe me anything.
0.0	0.5	We have to end crony capitalism in Washington, where the lobbyists and the powerful can get tax breaks and tax credits, and the American people don't get laws in their interest.
0.0	0.422207733101	So you know what?
0.0	0.473689611598	We need a fighter for this country again.
0.0	0.466852028995	But we shouldn't be the ones declaring that Assad must go.
0.0	0.451152220161	Enough said.
0.0	0.465027816047	The only way we're going to defund Planned Parenthood is have a pro-life president.
0.0	0.5	Well, in fact, I would argue that the disastrous invasion of Iraq, something that I strongly opposed, has unraveled the region completely and led to the rise of al-Qaeda and to ISIS.
0.0	0.480550884812	It is a constitutional right of every American to be able to protect themselves and their families.
0.0	0.487144471853	So I put together this statement, and the only reason I'm telling you about it today is because we really do have to get going, because if we have another three or four years -- you know, we're at $8 trillion now.
0.0	0.448383396914	We're running surpluses.
0.0	0.480737624269	But all of this has to come together when we have a positive attitude, an optimistic approach, an ability for us to set the tune as conservatives, to invite other people in to be part of that orchestra.
0.0	0.490477728532	So I not only had the opportunity to go through the Cold War struggles in Central America, and even after 9/11 to be involved.
0.0	0.5	So when you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration -- which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother -- clearly, we are looking at institutional racism.
0.0	0.464550862559	I don't see how he can possibly get the nomination.
1.0	0.610814818085	We lose 33,000 people a year already to gun violence, arming more people to do what I think is not the appropriate response to terrorism.
0.0	0.492031187673	Well, you just -- you just listed a litany of discredited attacks from Democrats and my political opponents, and I'm not gonna waste 60 seconds detailing them all.
0.0	0.475142974727	The issue is -- I believe, and I believe this honestly, and I don't know that there's much difference on guns between us.
0.0	0.460411883941	It's kind of basic.
0.0	0.483852108402	So what I would say is, number one, we need to be united against the threats that we face.
0.0	0.444098294908	See, they don't like that.
0.0	0.470654929436	I mean, that's just the bottom line.
0.0	0.436713734044	I'll say this.
0.0	0.474137927993	The questions that are being asked shouldn't be trying to get people to tear into each other.
0.0	0.453945147931	I understand we can disagree on the path forward.
0.0	0.394980836074	He's a progressive economist.
1.0	0.5	In fact, wages adjusted for inflation haven't risen since the turn of the last century, after my husband's administration.
0.0	0.480264036325	And what I hear is people's concern that the economy we have is a rigged economy.
0.0	0.475793542472	You know, we are the only nation, only developed nation on the planet...
0.0	0.464900850869	Give Bernie Sanders credit.
0.0	0.411780109115	I tell you that.
0.0	0.463985573086	You know, frankly, I did it in Washington, in Ohio, and I will do it again in Washington, if I'm president, to get this country moving again.
0.0	0.481081125141	And it's a tax you find in many companies in Europe.
0.0	0.472238728436	All of that together, we're going to be just fine and America is going to continue to lead the world.
0.0	0.454169951792	They don't know if it worked.
0.0	0.440006828002	And, I'll tell you something else.
0.0	0.418426204508	I happen to think...
0.0	0.487096475387	Well, first of all, like many other very big businessmen, I could name them here, but I'm not going to do that for a lot of obvious reasons, but the biggest, and almost all of them, they've all used the chapter laws, the bankruptcy laws to their own benefit.
0.0	0.48504751596	But the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with Iran, maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world, yes, that is something I want to achieve.
1.0	0.571290287679	I have not insulted Donald personally and I don't intend to.
0.0	0.478282505912	And then the Government steps in to try and solve the problem and we get a little further down to that progressive vision that Hillary Clinton is talking about.
0.0	0.400136218167	Okay, thank you.
0.0	0.428673125272	If that's not hypocrisy, I don't know what hypocrisy is.
0.0	0.487403573825	Senator, I have been -- I have been fighting for paid...
0.0	0.351738082595	And we are not England.
0.0	0.390965362606	And that's what's happening.
0.0	0.412152305146	We get a traitor.
0.0	0.478743643343	Yes, they have to stop being the main state sponsor of terrorism.
0.0	0.490579518954	And if you want to know who's telling the truth, you should look and ask people like Jeff Sessions and Steve King and Rush Limbaugh and Mark Levin, all of whom say, as Jeff Sessions said, responding to these false attacks just recently in Alabama -- he said, "if it wasn't for Ted Cruz, the Gang of Eight Rubio/Schumer bill would have passed.
0.0	0.480492247012	In fact, one of her first acts as president may very well be to pardon herself because Hillary Clinton...
0.0	0.46062764969	And they wonder whether somebody is getting something to -- keeping them from getting it.
0.0	0.429611967127	And who can blame them?
0.0	0.466341543755	I do and this is an important issue and I know we'll get to a lot of other critical ones as well.
0.0	0.451651354504	I would not want to go to that point.
0.0	0.487082099497	Health savings accounts are something that we introduced.
0.0	0.443110499297	That is the thing that obviously makes sense, we can do that.
0.0	0.465699932312	$24 trillion.
0.0	0.485854346351	Yes, we've lied to the American people about Social Security, and Medicare.
0.0	0.485031426996	And hopefully -- you know, Senator Graham, I -- I know where he's going to be on this, but we use Congress, and we use Congress to cut this funding.
0.0	0.373718059899	Sorry.
0.0	0.453755565395	That's the future of banking in America.
0.0	0.399233474212	I agree with that.
0.0	0.5	Even if it was a one percent chance, and it's far greater than one percent because (inaudible).
0.0	0.492912593897	So what we have tried to do and what President Obama succeeded in doing was to build on the health care system we have, get us to 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.5	It's the reason why I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and led the fight to stop the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, because it was clear then, like it's clear now, that border security is national security.
0.0	0.5	But I also understand, when a law enforcement official charged with the responsibility of preventing attacks -- to go back to our early questions, how do we prevent attacks -- well, if we can't know what someone is planning, we are going to have to rely on the neighbor or, you know, the member of the mosque or the teacher, somebody to see something.
0.0	0.482504801407	Thirdly, we need to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to send a serious signal that we're back in the game with Israel --
0.0	0.432727176423	And, here's the difference between me and Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.432873055254	We know about the French.
0.0	0.451500528665	They don't know how to bring it about.
0.0	0.382345925972	No accomplishment.
0.0	0.445221655033	They are much more than that.
0.0	0.453396025989	The planes are older than the pilots.
0.0	0.463363084634	I'll give you another example.
0.0	0.445414720403	And second of all...
0.0	0.477606199612	... you had two 110-story buildings come crashing down.
0.0	0.469523119573	Let me start -- I want to get to the substance of the question on jobs, but I want to start with something.
0.0	0.400494018729	That's not fair.
0.0	0.454692227856	I hope you will make a decision soon on this.
0.0	0.426113091884	Let's be frank here.
0.0	0.411012677585	Excuse me, John.
0.0	0.439636667555	We have a tremendous problem.
0.0	0.461671101085	You've got to bring people together.
0.0	0.484487827848	The cybersecurity challenges that we face, this administration failed us completely, completely.
0.0	0.474909931286	Big government favors the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected, and crushes the small and the powerless.
0.0	0.5	And, if this government doesn't pay it, than tell me what's different between the government and Bernie Madolf, who sits in prison today for doing less than what the government has done to the people on social security and Medicare in this country.
0.0	0.486236008154	And with your vote and your support and your prayers, I will lead with the citizens of this great nation the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.414581441943	And guess what?
0.0	0.473091747375	They send their cars over by the millions, and what do we do?
0.0	0.489208803315	Against the Republican leadership, who all thought it would be a great idea to merge investor banks and commercial banks and large insurance companies.
0.0	0.432913900718	That's when we become Greece.
0.0	0.436853731182	Not to contain them, but to defeat them.
0.0	0.490106790039	But I think in Syria the primary focus now must be on destroying ISIS and working over the years to get rid of Assad.
0.0	0.463828308005	Don't vote for me if you want to keep the gridlock in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.526597510833	So...
0.0	0.441390750268	That's what I'm working towards.
0.0	0.490062350664	I have the opportunity not just to run, but to win in the deep blue state of New York three times.
0.0	0.470353544421	As such, everybody is welcome from any race, any country, any religion, if they want to be Americans.
0.0	0.449784558481	I couldn't talk to anybody about it.
0.0	0.466325276814	But my wife is down here in the front, and I'm sure, if you'd like to talk to her later, she can give you more than you'll ever be able to take care of.
0.0	0.452843605332	You know, it's real estate.
0.0	0.321389529923	Thank you.
0.0	0.483288898652	And that means -- and that means radically changing the way we deal with mental health and addiction issues.
0.0	0.464080172044	I would just...
0.0	0.446161161122	It only makes common sense.
0.0	0.450215627543	But you would index it -- you would index it to the median wage.
0.0	0.454874402558	Well, yes, indeed.
0.0	0.441354154895	Yes, it's very simple.
0.0	0.409638274041	Then (inaudible)...
0.0	0.321389529923	Thank you.
0.0	0.416866104941	They're a scam.
0.0	0.43407227982	He didn't know.
0.0	0.457147382932	I believe that we have got to move toward a path toward citizenship.
0.0	0.5	Now what we have to take on is the pharmaceutical industry that is ripping off the American people every single day.
0.0	0.5	I voted against the first Gulf War, which set the stage, I believe, for the second Iraq war.
0.0	0.467981888147	No, I think the idea was that president -- then-Senator Obama was wrong for suggesting that it is a good idea to talk to your opponents.
0.0	0.441711972213	And that's what you expect from a leader.
0.0	0.451455250194	He has got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.481733057984	The president wants to do things without working with his Congress, without working with the legislature, and without getting the consent of the American people.
0.0	0.490996369764	So if -- if people who are in the private sector know what I stand for, it's what I fought for as a senator, it's what I will do as president, and they want to be part of once again building our economy so it works for everybody, more power to them, because they are the kind of business leaders who understand that if we don't get the American economy moving and growing, we're not going to recognize our country and we're not going to give our kids the same opportunities that we had.
0.0	0.48028927842	You know, the NASDAQ dropped 80 percent -- 80 percent -- and it took 15 years for the NASDAQ to recover.
0.0	0.467137001949	We're going to cut costs.
0.0	0.483473005719	You know, back in September, my friend Donald said that he had had his lawyers look at this from every which way, and there was no issue there.
0.0	0.463626683804	And we need to make that very clear to everybody.
1.0	0.570028798201	I'll tell you what else they're upset about: you're 50 or 51 years old, and some kid walks in and tells you you're out of work, and you don't know where to go and where to turn.
1.0	0.494139168217	Last week, I read 2,300 Humvees -- these are big vehicles -- were left behind for the enemy.
0.0	0.485323731395	There's probably no person I respect more in the country or in recent history than my father.
0.0	0.474672677883	I have a slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially.
0.0	0.484236569083	What our country needs right now is new leadership that will bring us together around the values that unite us and the freedoms that we share as Americans.
1.0	0.620714041117	It is the biggest job-killer in this country.
0.0	0.407816281543	So it is difficult.
0.0	0.470036654188	They've been talking about this issue for 30 years, and nothing ever happens.
0.0	0.5	You think about the regulatory cost and the tax cost -- that's why small businesses are closing, rather than being formed in our country right now.
0.0	0.46510943813	So I have nothing at all critical of him.
0.0	0.440994691259	I am glad Donald is running.
0.0	0.444281074435	It's harder to talk to your enemies.
1.0	0.595519038659	They are going to people showing videos of Donald Trump insulting Islam and Muslims in order to recruit more radical jihadists.
0.0	0.360143435691	Chris?
0.0	0.47634610503	I am the only person on this stage who has actually...
0.0	0.489121800972	I believe in action in which we put together a strong coalition of forces, major powers and the Muslim nations.
0.0	0.494369862006	And that's the difference between being a governor and having done that for the last six years in New Jersey and being someone who has never had to be responsible for any of those decisions.
0.0	0.47845839673	But this cannot be an American fight, although American leadership is essential.
0.0	0.482288525671	We ought to be working to improve it and prevent Republicans from both underming it and even repealing it.
0.0	0.427096041044	Oh, yes there is.
0.0	0.478381668293	We've got a president who cannot bring himself to say the words "radical Islamic terrorism."
0.0	0.49201129764	And we must substantially lower, as my legislation does, interest rates on student debt.
0.0	0.486910871441	We're going to have a three-bracket tax code, 10, 15 and 25 percent.
0.0	0.469865045772	You know, Chris, here's what happened with Medicaid in my state.
0.0	0.5	I have a concrete plan to do just that, which allows people to keep HSAs to encourage savings, it allows for people that are retiring with Social Security to be able to get a minimum of 125 percent of the poverty level so that there is a baseline that in this generous country of ours no one goes below.
0.0	0.493695021125	In many ways, a college degree today is equivalent to what a high school degree was 50, 60 years ago.
0.0	0.419060854775	It's not true.
1.0	0.506035161062	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.434208321189	My point is this.
0.0	0.482566554019	If we're going to have a coalition, we're going to have to have a coalition not just of people in the western part of the world, our European allies, but we need the Saudis, we need the Egyptians, we need the Jordanians, we need the Gulf states.
0.0	0.423204524488	We have to do something.
0.0	0.476180146557	Because I think frankly, maybe I'm wrong, but on our worst day, I think we have a lot more to offer the American people than the right wing's extremists.
0.0	0.5	But at the end of the day, what you have right now are millions of Americans working two or three jobs because their wages that they are earning are just too low.
0.0	0.493186715735	According to the FBI and the director of national intelligence, Syria's becoming a perfect platform to strike our nation.
0.0	0.450816259221	That's not profiling, that's law enforcement.
0.0	0.472515226243	If Teddy Roosevelt, a good Republican, were alive today, you know what he'd say?
0.0	0.460057791057	All the time.
0.0	0.526597510833	No.
0.0	0.490672028792	Well, first, let's remember why we became part of a coalition to stop Gadhafi from committing massacres against his people.
0.0	0.430491017587	It's not working.
0.0	0.489760778444	I sell apartments for -- I just sold an apartment for $15 million to somebody from China.
0.0	0.468704758768	OK. You know, the Democrats who have the ultimate super PAC, it's called the mainstream media.
0.0	0.48093762512	I do agree that in particular, Turkey and the Gulf nations have got to make up their minds.
0.0	0.485200321492	I feel very strongly that we have to reform our criminal justice system and we have to find ways to try to bring law enforcement together again with the communities that they are sworn to protect.
0.0	0.434960375769	I believe we are on the path to doing that.
0.0	0.469881996508	So the reporter said to me the other day, "But, Mr. Trump, you're not a nice person.
0.0	0.430478772871	Somebody said -- thank you, darlin'.
0.0	0.413616956094	He's wrong.
0.0	0.405619278759	Where were we attacked?
0.0	0.445965219421	Of course.
0.0	0.475904555944	They worked hard to provide us the chance at a better life.
0.0	0.490175088361	And multiple reputable journals, including The Wall Street Journal, said ours is the best.
0.0	0.466741488831	I actually have a plan.
0.0	0.5	If you are now hit on a 60 percent tax on both your income and on the wages you pay your employees, where are you going to get that money from?
0.0	0.450402924072	And I will tell you something that really galls me.
0.0	0.457581286483	I never said that.
0.0	0.484122006109	And we got to fight like crazy so people can think the American dream still exists, because it does, with rising wages, with full employment and with everybody in America -- and I mean everybody in America -- having an opportunity to realize the American dream of having a better life than their mother and their father.
0.0	0.483428688077	That's the way it should be, and I'm going to continue to reach out to thank all my online contributors for everything they are doing for me, to encourage them and help me do more just as Senator Sanders is.
0.0	0.444402315686	Well, I've been --
0.0	0.430472068195	I don't think it's gonna happen.
0.0	0.476045325618	I think issues and substance, policy and vision and record should be the meat of politics.
0.0	0.490980548767	How about we get the government to do what they're supposed to be doing, secure our borders, protect our people, and support American values and American families.
0.0	0.473796380724	The federal government should have to get warrants.
0.0	0.435136107336	It was an excruciating experience.
0.0	0.481672578736	The president doesn't understand -- and by the way, neither does Secretary Clinton -- and here's my warning to everybody out in the audience tonight.
0.0	0.4579551343	Good luck making something out of this mess."
0.0	0.463892638839	I will break up these banks.
0.0	0.459957750953	We want to be the United States of America.
0.0	0.436283294727	But, you know what we're not telling them?
0.0	0.430316362715	He has gone to China.
0.0	0.461855937427	Well, this is what I would say.
0.0	0.477599712896	We elected someone as president who wants to change America, who wants to make it more like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.489064295356	You're seeing cities like San Francisco, cities like Los Angeles doing it, and they are doing it well and workers are able to have more disposable income.
0.0	0.47556409746	Community banks are going out of business.
0.0	0.479029807242	This is the unholy alliance that people need to know about between right and left.
0.0	0.5	Republican leadership joined with every single Democrat, add $80 trillion to our debt to do nothing to fix the problems.
0.0	0.422207733101	I know.
0.0	0.5	You're looking at the -- at the man who introduced and fought on the floor as a freshman senator and passed the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 over two President Clinton vetoes.
0.0	0.470958068275	Imagine -- imagine -- if a politician were held to that standard of account.
0.0	0.469543197576	I have a debt to America I'll never repay.
0.0	0.487586731339	The fact of the matter is, the more our people earn, the more money they spend, and the more our whole economy grows.
0.0	0.485710321155	If you're running for president of the United States and you don't understand that we need more American ground forces in Iraq and that America has to be part of a regional ground force that will go into Syria and destroy ISIL in Syria, then you're not ready to be commander in chief.
0.0	0.484131559417	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.444193771957	...This is a matter not of math, this is a matter of morality.
0.0	0.486429963889	First of all, I'd like to recognize Governor Haley for her incredible leadership in the aftermath of the --
0.0	0.468864318591	Well, Senator, look, I think we're in vigorous agreement here.
0.0	0.475656263921	They should be able to walk in the door tomorrow and get a variety of treatments that work for them.
0.0	0.482758069084	Yes, I thought about running four years ago.
0.0	0.485021005867	I've been held accountable for six years as the governor of New Jersey and with a Democratic legislature, I've gotten conservative things done.
0.0	0.483032953814	If I'm president of the United States and Congress tries to cut the military, I will veto that in a millisecond.
0.0	0.483114930743	We took a loan against our assets to invest it in that campaign to defend ourselves against those attacks.
0.0	0.469218036911	And I know that term gets my Republican friends nervous.
0.0	0.471764035443	And the people of New Jersey, I've seen it.
0.0	0.466526485302	We have people out of work.
0.0	0.451363945494	You can go to my website...
0.0	0.5	You have to reform Social Security, and the simple way to do it is to make sure that the wealthiest don't receive the same benefits as people that are lower-income.
0.0	0.473880353342	It'll be a pretty busy day, but that Iran negotiation is going to be torn up on day one.
0.0	0.489244655986	But I think it's important to understand there's a significant difference that I have with Senator Sanders about how best to provide quality, affordable health care for everyone.
0.0	0.438279173857	We'll go to the Congress.
0.0	0.440274124747	If I was president, I'd say, "Congratulations.
0.0	0.457651161125	Because I don't think the American people are all that interested in this.
0.0	0.411781211145	I love China.
0.0	0.451380140965	Today, I'm 60, I'm not married, I don't have any kids.
0.0	0.47382640847	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.476250956216	So I hope and pray and cannot wait until this state and others give me an opportunity to serve this party as its nominee because I will defeat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.4884788932	I far prefer that and the chances we have to be successful there than trying to start all over again, gridlocking our system, and trying to get from zero to 100 percent.
0.0	0.487419493881	In fact, it's the chief argument by democrats against many of the different flat tax proposals.
0.0	0.453372910414	We have a country of laws.
0.0	0.488353772013	And what I believe right now, and I believe this is terribly important, is the United States of America cannot succeed, or be thought of as the policeman of the world, that when there's an international crisis all over the world, in France and in the U.K. Or -- hey, just call up the American military and the American taxpayers, they're going to send the troops.
0.0	0.465682995911	So, yes, we can talk about it as a racial issue.
0.0	0.474255318915	I am, but people are upset, and they're upset for a reason about the future of this country.
0.0	0.5	My plan is to make it work, to tell Saudi Arabia that instead of going to war in Yemen, they, one of the wealthiest countries on Earth, are going to have to go to war against ISIS.
0.0	0.399491692203	They knew that.
0.0	0.474100647675	Well, first of all, I know that the President has appealed the decision to the Supreme Court.
1.0	0.464092669797	I did introduce legislation to reign in compensation.
0.0	0.485422900143	In Houston, Texas, there's an organization in place because someone acted on their heart, wanted to make sure that there's no homeless veterans in Houston.
0.0	0.430863190041	But we stuck to our message.
0.0	0.493037213034	And the fact is those jobs are critical, they're hard working members of the middle class and they need to be paid attention to because they're Americans and they carry the load.
0.0	0.477742959051	We're a country of laws, not of men, not of people who do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.474969937341	Close the gun show loophole, close the online loophole and...
0.0	0.47772604928	But I think -- and I say this with due respect -- that I worry too much that Secretary Clinton is too much into regime change and a little bit too aggressive without knowing what the unintended consequences might be.
0.0	0.46938280562	Disparaging women, disparaging hispanics, that's not a sign of strength.
0.0	0.455126199086	They can't lead us.
0.0	0.481664333031	And she turned around many lives.
0.0	0.455003660883	And for the sake of me, I can't figure out which one is which.
0.0	0.429898753981	That's not right.
0.0	0.446817957312	I do think that it's important to defend it.
0.0	0.487590820645	You know, 200 years ago, America was founded on this powerful principle that our rights don't come from government.
0.0	0.472248939065	The big corporations have the scale to deal with all of this.
0.0	0.474708275689	If somebody's already stolen money from you, are you going to give them more?
0.0	0.433618184821	Those hedge funds.
0.0	0.5	This is what I think -- this is what many economists believe that one of the reasons that real unemployment in this country is 10 percent, one of the reasons that African American youth unemployment and underemployment is 51 percent is the average worker in America doesn't have any disposable income.
1.0	0.587177243676	They were watching the humiliation of our young ten sailors, sitting on the floor with their knees in a begging position, their hands up.
0.0	0.449861859312	And I believe he is absolutely right.
0.0	0.5	And, also, acting according to our principles and constructing a new foreign policy of engagement and collaboration, and doing a much better job of identifying threats before they back up into military corners.
0.0	0.464625074271	I'll bring back our jobs, and I'll bring back our money.
0.0	0.526597510833	No.
0.0	0.445004755094	And they're wonderful people.
0.0	0.488903675156	We need to be much more far thinking in this new 21st century era of -- of nation state failures and conflict.
0.0	0.444280146833	It goes in the right direction.
0.0	0.493452819132	I've heard a lot of hot rhetoric here tonight, but I've got to tell you, as somebody that actually passed a budget; that paid down a half-a-trillion dollars of our national debt, you can't do it alone.
0.0	0.486310265641	Now I think an area in kind of a vague way, or not so vague, where Secretary Clinton and I disagree is the area of regime change.
0.0	0.474208926374	And this president, given what Ted said right at the beginning, he's absolutely right.
0.0	0.432983146268	I think there is a consensus.
0.0	0.429898753981	Right.
0.0	0.459844562101	But in 2008, we elected a president that didn't want to fix America.
0.0	0.461628232696	We actually did it.
0.0	0.463107630244	But Secretary Clinton, you've been on three sides of this.
0.0	0.468491532264	This campaign is not just about electing a president.
0.0	0.471406934253	When I have to build a hotel, I pay interest.
0.0	0.424723872842	OK, good.
0.0	0.482511583213	A friend of mine who's a great manufacturer, calls me up a few weeks ago.
0.0	0.5	He's lost $4,000 in the last seven years in his income because of this administration.
0.0	0.435230727004	Washington is broken.
0.0	0.473047739057	We're not -- the American people -- forget about anything else, they've already been lied to and stolen from.
0.0	0.425726108299	But I want to go further.
0.0	0.466540176521	But I had to stand up and come back and get the best that we could.
0.0	0.487898867245	The reality is that both the African-American community and the white community do marijuana at about equal rates.
0.0	0.436052665989	There was nothing to this birther issue.
0.0	0.433153729698	... but wait a minute...
0.0	0.5	We created 2,000 new jobs in the solar industry and we fought every single day to adopt more inclusive economic practices.
0.0	0.422889465113	Thank you very, very much.
0.0	0.447698757228	We warned about the 9/11 attack before the 9/11 attack occurred.
0.0	0.466118322914	Well, let me just say something.
0.0	0.422207733101	You know why?
0.0	0.492528581279	Now, you can support one now that's very low.
0.0	0.438593068985	Look, I served on...
0.0	0.454597114916	We're going to get more revenue.
0.0	0.464847210388	And let's not let the secular progressives drive that out of us.
0.0	0.487016862163	And if they have to be in the Middle East for 20 or 30 years no problem.
0.0	0.487386770675	You know how many votes John McCain missed when he was carrying out that furious comeback that you're now modeling after?
0.0	0.467554440441	All we need to do is protect them, they will be in their own country.
0.0	0.468084200772	I've seen plenty of other people follow up?
0.0	0.379448634605	Whoa.
0.0	0.432150330392	They have to be alert to problems.
0.0	0.46836907965	And secondly, we should pass the legislation that I've introduced...
0.0	0.477863147907	... everybody nervous to get out of their cars if you're a law enforcement officer.
0.0	0.489433843711	When millions of Americans rose up against Planned Parenthood, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.464349538291	So I don't think you can paint with a broad brush.
0.0	0.526597510833	That's what it is.
0.0	0.483717805061	We have to eliminate the sequester, rebuild our military in a way that makes it clear that we're back in the game.
0.0	0.446714617886	What he wants is something to get done.
0.0	0.5	Now in terms of their really stunning hit piece, what they mentioned is when I was running for senate -- unlike Hillary Clinton, I don't have masses of money in the bank, hundreds of millions of dollars.
0.0	0.479417424468	So it's unfair to say in total...
0.0	0.5	And what I said and I think what Governor O'Malley is saying, and I hope you say, is when the middle class of this country is disappearing, when we have massive income and wealth inequality, when we're the only major country on earth not guaranteeing health care to all people, all the issues that the governor talked about, the secretary talked about, those are the issues.
0.0	0.482599709114	They're gonna spend their $1 billion in Mexico instead.
0.0	0.487819821173	In fact, I was all for you until you started doing that, because that's a misrepresentation, number one.
0.0	0.477998460489	And I went to one of these Turkish refugee camps right on the border of Syria.
0.0	0.426847379839	But not for us.
0.0	0.493404806954	And we should back up the recent donors conference to make sure we have made our contribution to try to deal with the enormous cost that these refugees are posing to Turkey and to members of the E.U.
0.0	0.468175795257	They're sending us not the right people.
0.0	0.461343251216	He's been a negative force.
0.0	0.5	John, listen, let's keep in mind that for one-third of the 60 million Americans on Social Security it represents 90 percent of their income.
1.0	0.578385700989	And the reason I said that is because the FBI director told the American people, told Congress, that he could not guarantee he could vet them and it would be safe.
0.0	0.479013735188	Look, the conservative message is economic growth and along with economic growth goes opportunity for everybody in America.
0.0	0.472702948265	I do not think we should promise or even look toward normalizing relations because we have a lot of other business to get done with Iran.
1.0	0.479591374437	But I will -- but I will tell you this, the socialist says they're going to pay for everything and give you everything for free, except they don't say they're going to raise it through taxes to 90 percent to do it.
0.0	0.469722963119	I try to live by the rules, no matter what they are, and I was brought up that way as a kid.
0.0	0.428806932441	...the only reason is -- look...
0.0	0.478604122305	Ours was intended to be a citizen government.
0.0	0.494026035742	So a large accounting firm and my accountants have been working for months, because it's big and complex, and they've put together a statement, a financial statement, just a summary.
0.0	0.430699946469	The Obama administration.
0.0	0.487625796907	So the things I have done in office are the things that actually invest in growing our economy and making wages go up.
0.0	0.438273328095	This issue is not about that anymore.
0.0	0.438747052388	When you became president, you had a Democratic Congress and a filibuster-proof Democratic Senate.
0.0	0.467011218949	The Democrats can't even come up with one.
0.0	0.491921916399	Hey, I'm in the United States Senate, and anyone who doesn't think that there is an enormous amount of waste and inefficiency and bureaucracy throughout government would be very, very mistaken.
0.0	0.464466400643	Sometimes it's a complicated situation, but some things are black and white.
0.0	0.47635383085	We can have debt-free college in the United States.
0.0	0.460841957005	We need a unifier, not a cynical divider in chief, and that's exactly what I will do.
0.0	0.5	Thousands of people killed, and the cleanup started the next day, and it was the most horrific cleanup, probably in the history of doing this, and in construction.
0.0	0.461431177391	And I'll tell you one thing that we never talk about -- we haven't talked about it tonight.
0.0	0.482161155365	We need to get back in the game as it relates to our Arab nations.
0.0	0.472936520335	And I believe that Puerto Rico ought to have the right of self-determination.
1.0	0.616200569805	I have more donations from students and teachers than I do from people associated with Wall Street.
0.0	0.43163143799	It's not fair trade.
0.0	0.474567300896	I have -- look, I would agree with much of what Senator Sanders says, Kevin.
0.0	0.401731891624	That is what I want to do.
0.0	0.508425812741	Now, Secretary Clinton's Super PAC, as I understand it, received $25 million dollars last reporting period, $15 million dollars from Wall Street.
0.0	0.460642152785	And somebody walked in and shot them, killed them.
0.0	0.493833579573	Marco stood today, standing on this stage Marco supports legalization and citizenship for 12 million illegals.
1.0	0.48576832574	7 percent and 8 percent to go to college?
0.0	0.513352400532	Free college, a single payer system for health, and it's been estimated were looking at 18 to $20 trillion, about a 40 percent in the federal budget.
0.0	0.478943696011	If you get caught abusing this program, you should never be able to use it again.
0.0	0.395655018562	And there should be some regulation.
0.0	0.383868400611	No, I love them.
0.0	0.493832519669	What's happening in Syria and Iraq is that, because of the failures in the region, including the failure of the prior government in Baghdad, led by Maliki, there has been a resurgence of Sunni activities, as exemplified by ISIS.
0.0	0.526597510833	It's not.
0.0	0.494253879926	The federal government can play a role in allowing them to do that, but they should not -- the process of statehood or the status of Puerto Rico won't be solved until we get to the bigger issue of how you deal with the structural economic problems they're facing right now.
0.0	0.493316954496	And he also had no trouble appointing an investment banker to be in charge of his consumer protection bureau when he was governor.
0.0	0.482684773402	They're looking -- they're recruiting people that enter this country as doctors and engineers and even fiances.
0.0	0.460010864603	But what he's touching -- talking about, I think has got merit.
0.0	0.468190417129	Well, our prayers are with the people of France tonight, but that is not enough.
0.0	0.5	In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense.
0.0	0.415281217001	And that's what we have to contrast.
0.0	0.5	We actually raised it to the highest goals of any state in the nation also in minority and women participant goals because we understood that the way you reinvigorate and make fair market American capitalism work, is to make the choices and the investments that include more people more full in the economic success of your state.
0.0	0.436034140492	They do it to us, we don't it.
0.0	0.457663036978	I'll suggest a part of that was his celebrity.
0.0	0.468986292931	We honest to god are here to get this country back on track.
0.0	0.488044147849	And to expand on Mr. Carson's -- or Dr. Carson's question, let's face it, we have laws already.
0.0	0.479967717124	Yeah.  TRUMP R 15 75 0 N So I finally got it over there and they charged me a big tariff.  TRUMP R 15 75 1 N They're not supposed to be doing that.  TRUMP R 15 75 2 N I told them.
0.0	0.460649562785	And, they're always going to say, "Well, we're going to fix this one day."
0.0	0.492155875356	I have proposed there be a Middle East NATO so that we can combine our allies there to stand up to Iranian expansion, and at the same time join together to begin to stop and this ISIL thing before it becomes an actual state.
0.0	0.462303090126	We sent our Texas ranger recon teams.
0.0	0.464676229796	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.486568101757	If you do that, you don't just change the economy, you transform the lives of millions of hurting Americans.
0.0	0.438563651628	Here's a fact.
0.0	0.488825026592	It just needs a corporate executive type at the top that's done it before.
0.0	0.47918329556	Who actually has stood up not just to Democrats, but to leaders in our own party?
0.0	0.48277425471	We agree that Wall Street should never be allowed to wreck Main Street again.
0.0	0.449082377312	And I was proud to stand with him and support it.
0.0	0.487637877746	I've got a proven record fighting to defend the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.460442125635	They are not doing it now.
0.0	0.321389529923	Thank you.
0.0	0.452391868546	You can't just ban all Muslims.
0.0	0.482717425988	They should be running all the time, then they won't have time to plan attacks against us.
0.0	0.481359024362	Roads, bridges, water systems, wastewater plants, who denies that?
1.0	0.61463015445	They would repeal the Affordable Care Act, not improve it.
0.0	0.490920921813	I've heard about tax schemes that don't add up, that put our kids in -- in a deeper hole than they are today.
0.0	0.476022963878	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.43979095028	It is a real horror.
0.0	0.439820337876	And they're all over the place.
0.0	0.393159742478	Oh.
0.0	0.481320382178	And I am very grateful for all my predecessors and my successors because each of them not only did what she could to support her husband and our country but often chose to work on important issues that were of particular concern.
0.0	0.465140656763	We're going to save Social Security, and we're going to save Medicare.
0.0	0.431628916768	Am I supposed to dislike them?
0.0	0.378325320365	Excuse me.
0.0	0.474452989341	We are not the world's policeman, but we need to stand up and be ready.
0.0	0.489813175646	I've watched to see people say that we should dismantle Medicare and Medicaid and leave the senior citizens out -- out in the -- in the cold.
0.0	0.455193007365	Whatever it takes, as long as it takes, to defeat them.
0.0	0.449872795379	... Chris, keep it coming...
0.0	0.469626350926	They like General Motors, so they give them a pass.

0.0	0.486442205629	And it is imperative that we do more not only to help our friends and partners protect themselves and protect our own homeland, but also to work to try to deal with this arc of instability, which does have a lot of impact on what happens in a country like Libya.
0.0	0.458312582002	China doesn't pay the tariff, the buyer pays the tariff.

0.0	0.482108767235	If the United States does not lead, there is not another leader.
0.0	0.483546221792	But as president, I will spend even more time thinking about the futures of all the kids and the grandchildren in this country because I want to make sure every single child has a chance to live up to his or her God-given potential.
0.0	0.492977260928	And for my part, I have demonstrated the ability to have the backbone to take on Wall Street in ways that Secretary Clinton never, ever has.

0.0	0.487249316127	I would begin by saying that I'm not sure it's a weakness, but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for America's future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people.
0.0	0.48477067536	They would like to rip it up and start all over again, throw our nation back into this really contentious debate that we've had about health care for quite some time now.
0.0	0.481489499035	And now, like never before, we need our Muslim American neighbors to stand up and to -- and to be a part of this.
0.0	0.490662902796	I think Americans want someone to have a track record of showing them how to get this country back on record, someone who will stand up and every day project that best days of America are in front of us.
0.0	0.480459787698	We also have to build a coalition at home.

0.0	0.432269087336	You opposed him then.

1.0	0.633313828428	We have the highest rate of childhood poverty among almost any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.494532504084	And it is easy to talk the talk about ending Citizens United, but what I think we need to do is show by example that we are prepared to not rely on large corporations and Wall Street for campaign contributions, and that's what I'm doing.
0.0	0.491075926265	This is a new era of conflict where traditional ways of huge standing armies are not as -- serve our purposes as well as special ops, better intelligence and being more proactive.

0.0	0.491794601296	You cannot destroy ISIS with a military that's being diminished.
0.0	0.467467012527	That's the truth of the matter and you see it every time with this president.
0.0	0.401901202335	OK?
0.0	0.452327775652	And until that happens there's not going to be consensus on this issue.
0.0	0.404788956225	It's what they call it.
0.0	0.456100300907	And that's why I think these ideas up here are great, and that's what we should have is have more discussions like this and less gotcha.
0.0	0.401901202335	OK?
0.0	0.465353024617	Here's my second problem.

0.0	0.458578518263	In this building, in Trump Tower.
0.0	0.487389303227	And the fact of the matter is that the more fully people participate, the more our workers earn, the more they will spend, the more our economy will grow.
0.0	0.411948614843	You bet they do.
0.0	0.493862007738	What we have to do is put all of our resources through the Department of Homeland Security, through the State Department, through our intelligence agencies, and we have to have an increased vetting and screening.

0.0	0.488399326374	If I'm elected president, we will not let in refugees from countries controlled by ISIS or Al Qaida.
0.0	0.386631066169	It is why we have to simplify.
0.0	0.5	I'd also go after these sanctuary cities, do everything we can to make sure that we are not -- that we are actually prosecuting and cutting off funding for cities that are harboring illegal aliens, and then finally making sure the IRS is not going after conservative or religious groups.
0.0	0.5	There were four dissenters, and they said that they believe the Second Amendment protects no individual right to keep and bear arms whatsoever, which means, if their view prevailed and the next president's going to get one, two, three, maybe four Supreme Court justices, the court will rule that not a single person in this room has any right under the Second Amendment and the government could confiscate your guns.
0.0	0.487577301713	If the American people see us granting amnesty they will never again believe in legal immigration.
0.0	0.458203326131	ISIS has brought down a Russian airliner.
0.0	0.467654766161	It was a big insurance company, AIG.
0.0	0.425107989079	Iraq is a mess.
0.0	0.47863745713	We need a leader that wrote "The Art of the Deal."
0.0	0.451368546186	... on the issue -- on the issue of citizenship, Donald...
0.0	0.494423295918	-- living in extreme poverty is the highest level on record.
0.0	0.485171881254	It was good for the economy and it was a way to rebuke the terrorists who had attacked our country.
0.0	0.474585949856	That's real moral authority that we need in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.387550410317	Yeah.
0.0	0.475729996575	Who has the experience, who has the knowledge, who has the judgement, who has the clarity, and vision and strength of resolve to keep this country safe.
0.0	0.5	And specifically said to Wall Street, that what they were doing in the mortgage market was bringing our country down.
0.0	0.459716070958	And then when we win that, and we will win that against ISIS as it settles down, and we should leave.
0.0	0.481183441239	I want to -- before my time runs out I want to get back to this issue of ISIS versus Iran.
0.0	0.463636604234	Are they going to stand with us against this kind of jihadi radicalism or not?
0.0	0.467483583926	That's why when I'm president we are going to rebuild our intelligence capabilities.
0.0	0.482041904917	It's called the mainstream media who every single day...
0.0	0.482047748096	That's why we embraced individual liberty, and we became the freest people ever, and the result was the American miracle.
0.0	0.452168461679	Well, let me tell you this.
0.0	0.478220153482	Every time he's got a chance, going all the way back to -- remember that Great Beer Summit he had after he messed up that time.
0.0	0.421461485094	Sure did.
0.0	0.463087325495	And I agree with much of what the Secretary and the Governor have said.
0.0	0.465942302314	That's what I understand is the request from the international...
0.0	0.487139475607	And you don't go tell Muslim nations you want them to be part of a coalition when you have a leading candidate for president of the United States who insults their religion.
0.0	0.475025891503	I'm not -- my campaign is going to be about the future of America, it's not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage.
0.0	0.431194696438	That makes no sense at all.
0.0	0.488316853108	And we know of the tragic, terrible event that lead to the death of Dontre Hamilton right here in Milwaukee, a young man unarmed, who should still be with us.
0.0	0.469836639283	We ought to send some real junk, because, frankly, it would be -- we ought to send our surplus.
0.0	0.464345411415	Reforming entitlements, cutting taxes.
0.0	0.480164769418	My tax plan enables you to fill out your taxes on a postcard so we can abolish the IRS.
0.0	0.414835510659	That's my bill.
0.0	0.5	I understand that you're building a nice $2.5 billion car factory in Mexico and that you're going to take your cars and sell them to the United States zero tax, just flow them across the border."
0.0	0.441543956278	Not my kind of guy.
0.0	0.491519986554	We end up paying the highest prices in the world.
0.0	0.433153729698	Wait a minute.
0.0	0.461628232696	We actually did it.
0.0	0.481114088089	When I'm president of the United States, we are going to win this war on ISIS.
0.0	0.489147907124	And that problem is too big regulations like the EPA, too much new taxes on business that we have seen and "Obamacare."
0.0	0.5	Martha, that -- you know, one of the reasons why I have advocated for a no-fly zone is in order to create those safe refuges within Syria, to try to protect people on the ground both from Assad's forces, who are continuing to drop barrel bombs, and from ISIS.
0.0	0.47674849478	From my perspective, we have to prevent the Republicans from rolling back the progress that we've made.
0.0	0.472849558781	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.440833786375	He's not arming the Kurds.
0.0	0.453050652986	Well, I want to know, did you win?
0.0	0.465385581529	We have to shut down their internet capability.
0.0	0.47567999087	We are looking at an economy in which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.
0.0	0.461462565778	They don't buy their guns from a collector.
0.0	0.466156111325	For once, let's do that, and stop trying to give them some kind of fantasy that's never going to come true.
0.0	0.466952408677	I mean, I ask that with all due respect.
0.0	0.452318337911	We need to know who our neighbors are.
0.0	0.380195219392	We bailed them out.
0.0	0.492435418653	Not only are deductibles rising, 29 million Americans still have no health insurance and millions of people can't afford to go to the doctor.
0.0	0.451319106151	And they're tired of being ripped off by everybody in the world.
0.0	0.420286556512	There are other racial discrepancies.
0.0	0.472893666934	We need to have stronger families.
0.0	0.465094766839	We have to work with NATO to protect Eastern Europe against any kind of Russian aggression.
0.0	0.480921200339	I said we should go to 65, but only if we have as careful a screening and vetting process as we can imagine, whatever resources it takes because I do not want us to, in any way, inadvertently allow people who wish us harm to come into our country.
0.0	0.449358819722	Does my family like me?
0.0	0.448900664197	We must anticipate these threats before they happen.
0.0	0.49205653438	And when he moved on his own people, threatening a massacre, genocide, the Europeans and the Arabs, our allies and partners, did ask for American help and we provided it.
0.0	0.41501384648	They're great.
0.0	0.459358800319	I respectfully disagree with Senator Sander's approach.
0.0	0.432166621584	Syria is a mess.
0.0	0.487524259077	And nobody watching at home believed that any of the moderators had any intention of voting in a Republican primary.
0.0	0.443100174091	I heard what they said.
0.0	0.484964307875	We can slap on sanctions alone, on day one, but it's not gonna be anywhere near as effective.
0.0	0.489641882986	OK. You know, you judge a nation not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how you treat, we treat, the most vulnerable and fragile people in our nation.
0.0	0.443104565735	This is a watershed election.
0.0	0.466120199275	At least he's honest enough to call himself a socialist.
0.0	0.5	$19 billion of tax cuts, 1.3 million jobs created.
0.0	0.489788309543	It was a company that had grown into a bloated, inept bureaucracy that cost too much and delivered too little to customers and shareholders.
0.0	0.490417895105	In my case, whether it's health care, or getting us to debt-free tuition, or moving us toward paid family leave, I have been very specific about where I would raise the money, how much it would cost, and how I would move this agenda forward.
0.0	0.448812100361	The most mistreated people.
0.0	0.321389529923	Thank you.
0.0	0.469971740452	So I put all of this together, again, on my website and I've gotten such a good response.
0.0	0.486599754451	People can promise you something, I delivered in the blue state of New York.
0.0	0.470270242156	He's a left-wing judicial activist, Harvard Law professor who was Al Gore's lawyer in Bush versus Gore.
0.0	0.466877829708	I feel like I need -- I feel like I need a Washington to English dictionary converter, right?
0.0	0.49218254962	That's what we need to to, and I laid that out prior to the crisis with the advice of a lot of people, including 12 Medal of Honor recipients that I'm proud that they're supporting my campaign.
0.0	0.461754819181	Well, obviously, you don't understand my views on homosexuality.
0.0	0.486116524231	I want those kids to know that if they study hard, they do their homework, regardless of the income of their families, they will in fact be able to get a college education because we are going to make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.5	And, this year, in 2015, New Jersey's had the best year of job growth that our state has ever had in the last 15 years.
0.0	0.5	More and more military personnel are leaving becoming veterans, and the waiting list grows.
0.0	0.375258129606	(APPLAUSE)
0.0	0.483550038902	Yeah, David, look, for crying out loud, our country has been attacked, we have pressing issues involving how we're going to adapt to this changing era of warfare.
0.0	0.479645690111	I have so many Web sites, I have them all over the place.
0.0	0.479846287236	You know, somebody is loading guns and ammunition into a house, I think it's a good idea to call 911.
0.0	0.44780652013	That's exactly what we saw.
0.0	0.5	It's now half the size of what it was prior to Operation Desert Storm.
0.0	0.449874145586	My budget was mentioned.
0.0	0.466864863544	Take a look at the deal he's making with Iran.
0.0	0.454169951792	They don't know if it worked.
0.0	0.5	Now, the whole region has been rendered unstable, in part because of the aftermath of the Arab Spring, in part because of the very effective outreach and propagandizing that ISIS and other terrorist groups do.
0.0	0.437439287542	We know about the Brits.
0.0	0.48140735503	I would suggest to you that we need to leave the Cold War behind us, and we need to put together new alliances and new approaches to dealing with this, and we need to restrain ourselves.
0.0	0.462273591973	We also need a nominee, a candidate who will endorse our own principles.
0.0	0.466512828325	You will have welcomed Heidi and our girls, Caroline and Catherine, into your homes.
0.0	0.5	I can see why people are angry and scared, because this president has created a condition where our national security has weakened dramatically.
0.0	0.479262810516	It is disgraceful, and in a Christie administration, they would know much, much better than to do that.
0.0	0.434238813301	It feels different.
0.0	0.471377761805	This is one of the great tragedies in our country today.
0.0	0.480331558059	If you elect me president of the United States, I will secure that southern border.
0.0	0.474030797363	That is our government today.
0.0	0.412328868	That is important.
0.0	0.463067669769	I will do everything I can as president to get that accomplished.
0.0	0.474396530126	But Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term, and you should be showing up to work.
0.0	0.473555147452	I looked into the eyes of moms and dads who would do anything in their power to protect our country's values and our freedoms.
0.0	0.467996367435	We're going to take the political handcuffs off the military.
0.0	0.507985335383	All the way back to when Ronald Reagan signed a piece of legislation that basically allowed for amnesty for over 4 million people, and the border is still not secure.
0.0	0.478954935268	The rate -- the rate -- the rate is gonna be much closer to 15 percent.
0.0	0.465298146022	So I think, yeah, regime change is easy, getting rid of dictators is easy.
0.0	0.480015132574	I honored my commitments, and as president, I will honor every commitment that I make to the men and women of this country.
0.0	0.474157668547	Good question, but I want to tell you, my great concern is that we are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job.
0.0	0.486462758654	And we finally have a U.N. Security Council Resolution bringing the world together to go after a political transition in Syria.
0.0	0.5	We are nineteen trillion dollars -- our country's a mess and we can't let all these people come into our country and break our borders.
0.0	0.480504047647	We're gutting our military, and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were.
0.0	0.486679702009	And I believe that one of the big failings in that region is a lack of human intelligence.
0.0	0.466478362223	But I do take what Alan Krueger said seriously.
0.0	0.360143435691	Chris...
0.0	0.423844360228	We're gonna be there very soon.
0.0	0.441269648767	Because -- because Donald's mother was born in Scotland.
0.0	0.49405337364	And a mom of a service member of ours who served two duties in Iraq said, Governor O' Malley, please, when you're with your other candidates and colleagues on stage, please don't use the term 'boots on the ground'.
0.0	0.459355266335	And I have many great Muslim friends.
0.0	0.491803943138	Our country rise up again, but we need to have a compelling conservative agenda that we present to the American people in a way that doesn't disparage people, that unites us around our common purpose.
0.0	0.5	There is no president, in my view, not Hillary Clinton, not Bernie Sanders, who has the capability or the power to take on Wall Street, large campaign donors, the corporate media, the big money interests in this country alone.
0.0	0.454247443739	Think back to Garland, Texas.
0.0	0.526597510833	We have Dodd-Frank.
0.0	0.463208021572	Well, I think there are some differences of opinion here, perhaps between the secretary and myself.
0.0	0.459171199062	He doesn't meet -- here's the difference.
0.0	0.466863317158	I disagree with free college for everybody.
0.0	0.477221865256	Let's let a Justice Department -- and I will make an attorney general who will enforce the law and make justice more than just a word.
0.0	0.487470773992	You know, the American president has to both keep our families safe and make the economy grow in a way that helps everyone, not just those at the top.
0.0	0.478930860564	But the president needs to be laying the groundwork right now for the ability to slap those sanctions back on worldwide.
0.0	0.472753358216	So, there does need to be a whole of government approach, but just because we're involved and we have a strategy doesn't mean we're going to be able to dictate the outcome.
0.0	0.493887458239	I think a lot of the Libyans who had been forced out of their country by Gadhafi who came back to try to be part of a new government, believed they knew what to do and it turned out that they were no match for some of the militaristic forces inside that country.
0.0	0.461931578194	... so you don't actually want to hear the answer, John?
1.0	0.476496144795	Two hundred children have been killed.
0.0	0.474256647336	And when you see a problem, you must act quickly to get on top of it.
0.0	0.474132348598	If I'm elected president, we will repeal every word of Obamacare.
0.0	0.450778766715	And they got a killer in San Bernardino in posing as a fiance.
0.0	0.48047474098	If it had gone right, believe me, she would have been running around to be able to take credit for it.
0.0	0.487193825533	There are a lot of training programs and education programs that I think can be streamlined and put into a much better format so that if we do continue them they can be more useful, in public schools, community colleges, and colleges and universities.
0.0	0.468382338283	And we can do it again together, all of us, to strengthen this country, work together.
0.0	0.465825935	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
1.0	0.459179146526	The 500,000 who came home with PTSD, and traumatic brain injury.
0.0	0.382821591026	Divide that out.
0.0	0.5	John, I don't think that there is a crisis at the state or local level that really you can point to and say, therefore, I am prepared for the sort of crises that any man or woman who is commander in chief of our country has to deal with.
0.0	0.456556879311	We don't need more of the same solutions.
0.0	0.484869354077	In fact, if more border security and these -- and more and more deportations were going to bring our Republican brothers and sisters to the table, it would have happened long ago.
0.0	0.378325320365	Excuse me, no.
0.0	0.42977639952	I have Ivanka, and Eric and Don sitting there.
0.0	0.485588510566	But -- if for some reason, Neil, he beats the rest of the field, I already know the Democrats are going to be bringing a suit.
0.0	0.483810535912	So I believe that, in fact, this country needs to move towards a living wage.
0.0	0.469361293505	And we ought to fight them on that level.
1.0	0.481680306731	You know, not only do I have hundreds of thousands of donors, most of them small.
0.0	0.491196377525	And so, look, the way that -- a stronger middle class is actually the source of economic growth.
0.0	0.477561333801	And you had better get rid of them, because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.485333169194	I think that was one of the worst foreign policy blunders in the more than history of the United States.
0.0	0.5	So while other candidates will talk about the things they would like to do, I actually got these things done in a state that defended not only a AAA bond rating, but the highest median income in America.
1.0	0.5	I am tired of sending $300 billion overseas to buy oil from people who hate our guts.
0.0	0.433384237551	Yes, I'm getting...
0.0	0.494648675288	In my view, we have got to see that weapons designed by the military to kill people are not in the hands of civilians.
0.0	0.475704511596	They're not going to turn into stockbrokers overnight or open up a chain of car washes.
1.0	0.603318460201	Let's not have the most expensive business tax rate in the world.
0.0	0.488091470561	They will also have to pay 16 percent on the money they pay their employees.
0.0	0.457591367862	I didn't say permanently.
0.0	0.462825422484	You can't be in favor of defend us...
0.0	0.485360085927	So, are we going to ban Muslims from India, from Indonesia, from countries that are strong allies -- that we need to build better relationships with?
0.0	0.453740057654	Madam Secretary, that is a low blow.
0.0	0.473611672397	But -- but we are going to end the absurdity, as Warren Buffet often remind us.
0.0	0.462158096392	There are hundreds of things like that.
0.0	0.480367662122	Because I think if you only think about the coalition abroad you're missing the main point, which is we need a coalition here at home.
0.0	0.451955375095	Kathie, this was not merely theory in Maryland.
0.0	0.47768116311	All over this country we have Republican candidates for president saying we hate the government.
0.0	0.486333050878	And, you know the old inscription, if you save one life, you've changed the world.
0.0	0.491297288851	ISIS is now found in affiliates in over a dozen countries.
0.0	0.47988058443	I buy it, because, frankly, I have an obligation to buy it, because they devalue their currency so brilliantly, they just did it recently, and nobody thought they could do it again.
1.0	0.595891368864	This small country has welcomed in many refugees.
1.0	0.484047405544	What Hillary Clinton's going to say, and has said before is, she wants to raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.443119209759	It is broke, it is not working.
0.0	0.456317486723	America was worth the wait.
0.0	0.477764371241	Three times, she refused to answer the question, because she refuses to be held accountable for anything that goes wrong.
0.0	0.466217616318	I give a lot of money away to charities and other things.
0.0	0.422889465113	Thank you all very much.
0.0	0.494378754881	I'm the only one on this stage who has a plan that's actually reduced -- actually going to reduce immigration.
0.0	0.488222403839	You will be the first Americans that get to answer the fundamental question, what comes next for this country after seven disastrous years of Barack Obama?
0.0	0.5	I would note, just for a historic aside, somebody told me earlier today we've had like 200 presidential primary debates, and this is the first time there have been a majority of women on the stage.
0.0	0.490359019644	And we should never be convinced to give up those freedoms in exchange for a promise of greater security; especially from someone as untried and as incompetent as Donald Trump.
0.0	0.471249806799	And, you know, that's been my message in New Hampshire.
0.0	0.477823294967	We need to end minimal sentencing.
0.0	0.447738676197	I voted yes to suspend that.
0.0	0.465426966303	To get the information from Hillary Clinton, you need to get a subpoena from the FBI.
0.0	0.418328977951	They throw down asphalt, and they throw.
0.0	0.488579110473	And so people are still going to get health care, thankfully, in emergency rooms, in hospitals.
0.0	0.448541237367	You take a look at the -- at Belgium.
0.0	0.479891897934	I think, though, government is too big now.
0.0	0.4283073011	That's a drag on the economy.
0.0	0.465007214363	And said, well, she said you were angry and I said to myself, huh, she's right.
0.0	0.465762995798	No, they don't like he beats the rest of the field, because they want me.
0.0	0.434284638035	That could be the great Trojan Horse.
0.0	0.479013311802	And I think when you give low-income kids -- African-American, white, Latino kids -- the opportunities to get their lives together, they are not going to end up in jail.
0.0	0.483063418094	And we need to bring our debt under control, make our economy stronger.
0.0	0.493857858394	Since, you know, the end of the last Clinton administration when incomes did go up for everybody.
0.0	0.468881137235	Maybe we would've gotten a deal where we didn't give everything away.
0.0	0.405836904414	I'm too trusting.
0.0	0.493966142564	We have a world that's out of control and has grown dangerous and a president that is weakening our military and making our foreign policy unstable and unreliable in the eyes of our allies.
0.0	0.472429562947	We're going to be actually out there trying to create a better life for hard-working Americans.
0.0	0.478978320964	They went to the vendor and said, "hey, something is wrong," and that was quietly dealt with.
0.0	0.461575016133	And as I looked out there at the eyes of our neighbors, I also looked in the eyes of veterans.
0.0	0.491449494379	But the first duty of the next president of the United States is to fix the mess at the Department of Veterans Affairs.
0.0	0.486583240871	I have worked with President Obama for the last seven years.
0.0	0.422301430922	Yes.
0.0	0.458046847069	You know, we've got a lot of great talkers running for president.
0.0	0.458062893704	That tells you right away where he was headed on all of this.
0.0	0.48079261757	Well, I wish you would have asked that question years ago when they broke it.
0.0	0.477528920234	And some of them, I will say, not all, have called me and said, "Donald, thank you very much; you're exposing an unbelievable problem and we have to get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.475332658796	Maria -- Maria, what you were talking about just now is called corporate inversion.
0.0	0.467729462034	I will do so in a way that will bring people together.
0.0	0.43678532106	... his answer -- you name it.
0.0	0.399219530339	He's not a leader.
0.0	0.446055980689	That is what I could do for the country.
0.0	0.408029769081	Check it out.
0.0	0.493535652594	Now that applies universally to giant corporations that with lobbyists right now are not paying taxes, and as small business.
0.0	0.47920252074	I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created.
0.0	0.442890131847	They'll all come back.
0.0	0.482302648874	We've all been talking about tax reforms tonight, and paying for infrastructure is caught right up in tax reform.
0.0	0.493441184204	We have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9/11, and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks, yet we see the terrible attack in San Bernardino and know that we haven't done enough.
0.0	0.476022963878	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
1.0	0.476971108397	And the overall message is that it doesn't result in job loss.
0.0	0.478304044103	And it's important that people really look hard at what the threats and dangers we face are, and who is best prepared for dealing with them.
0.0	0.476397420628	And I understand in many universities a heck of a lot of vice presidents who earn a big salary.
0.0	0.485537347562	We should look at college today the way high school was looked at 60 years ago.
0.0	0.4865931768	Well, Chris, I will apologize to nobody for the vigorousness with which I will fight terrorism, go after ISIS, hunt them down wherever they are, and utterly and completely destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.476813064318	If she gets elected, she's under investigation with the FBI right now.
0.0	0.4535367328	That would be a disaster for this country.
0.0	0.438440824203	Those are all really positive developments.
0.0	0.526597510833	Why is that?
0.0	0.483304449728	Well, I would suggest a fair tax system, and that's what we have proposed.
0.0	0.470510385956	And wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong.
0.0	0.459386675002	So we have to go after this both abroad and at home.
0.0	0.48824187593	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.526597510833	...
0.0	0.487692723037	And its bankruptcy and its failure nearly destroyed us.
0.0	0.490982250272	And in talking to a lot of our neighbors who are in that super wealthy, millionaire and billionaire category, a great numbers of them love their country enough to do more again in order to create more opportunity for America's middle class.
0.0	0.402032515142	He does great.
0.0	0.5	Doesn't hurt rich people if their bar of soap goes up ten cents, but it hurts the poor and the middle class.
0.0	0.46709790834	But I think it's the right road for us to try to travel.
0.0	0.47710502967	Someone who's going to stand up, and be very clear with our enemies as to the lines their going to draw and stand with them.
0.0	0.442420979729	We have to stop, and it has to stop now.
0.0	0.42396042028	Well, it ain't Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.41876945648	I think that's a mistake.
0.0	0.441940154207	May I respond?
0.0	0.454119708141	There are many lawyers.
0.0	0.463163236249	Bret, we're just starting.
0.0	0.481083233507	It's poor people and middle class.
0.0	0.409191195083	This is the election...
0.0	0.445362357455	And I said, "I know.
0.0	0.5	We're spending $80 billion locking people up, disproportionately Latino and African American.
0.0	0.47021197667	That is exactly what I just said and what I just described.

0.0	0.494773413179	The president of the United States admitting that he's weakening our government's position, our foreign policy standing, because he can't control spending in D.C..
0.0	0.488761634675	I think what we need is a commander in chief who is focused like a laser on keeping this country safe and on defeating radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.491873229039	And the people I have been accountable to every single day in the Senate are the 27 million Texans who I represent and I made a promise to them that I make to you today, which is, if I am elected, every single day I will do two things: tell the truth, and do what I said I would do.
0.0	0.5	I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years, and by the way, one of the members of that committee was Senator Strom Thurmond from South Carolina.
0.0	0.477366122666	And we keep young people on our policies until they turn 26.
0.0	0.355807172312	We are not France.
0.0	0.446143591918	You've got a bit of experience, I would imagine.
0.0	0.457043615232	I would put it in a blind trust.
0.0	0.479379934267	Bad by those in the Senate who voted for it and if I'm president, we'll make our intelligence community strong, and won't have to keep everybody out, we're just going to keep the bad folk out and make sure they don't harm us.
0.0	0.484295691745	That's why John McCain, even though he was born in Panama, was eligible to run for president.
0.0	0.478011769083	And I think once I'm in the White House we will have enough political capital to be able to do that.
0.0	0.479187958838	We need different solutions to solve the problems and to save our nation.
0.0	0.469491506425	We need to come together as a country because we have to realize that America is great, not from the top-down.
0.0	0.417278289447	I'll take that, too.
1.0	0.621686002417	Number one, States have been dis-investing in higher education.
0.0	0.477091760086	They wanted their patents and all their secrets before they agreed to buy planes from Boeing.
0.0	0.492781208991	We have a $19 trillion bipartisan debt and it continues to grow as we borrow money from countries that do not like us to pay for government we cannot afford.
0.0	0.433913366151	This guy is a petulant child.
0.0	0.449037805005	Total propaganda.
0.0	0.431812054871	We're running.
0.0	0.472540835957	Well, you've got to be on top of it right away.
0.0	0.4788711611	What I said was I don't believe that I would be president of the United States and have the same dysfunction that exists in Washington, D.C. now.
0.0	0.443182462975	As a senator, yes, I was a senator.
0.0	0.446536581485	They're saying, "Dad, you're going to do something that's going to be so tough."
0.0	0.473676559516	Well, first off, what we don't do is do what Hillary Clinton and John Kerry and Barack Obama want us to do, which is their solution for everything, put more taxes on it, give more money to Washington, D.C., and then they will fix it.
0.0	0.458902054955	I'm an eye surgeon from Bowling Green, Kentucky, I miss doing eye surgery, still get to do a little bit.
0.0	0.5	But I'd sign a second one, as I did in New York, as well, having a hard hiring freeze on adding new employees except for the military or defense-related positions.
0.0	0.471812235376	John, I -- if I -- a lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.488398954456	We got a military that needs equipment all over the place.
0.0	0.487092898223	I spent a lot of time in the situation room as secretary of state and there were many very difficult choices presented to us.
0.0	0.465883230702	We cannot elect somebody that doesn't know how to do the job.
0.0	0.46754111845	It is time to believe in America again.
0.0	0.480391647345	We also had attacks on two of our embassies in Tanzania, Kenya, when my husband was president.
0.0	0.48899469108	President Obama's preparing to send $100 billion or more to the Ayatollah Khamenei.
0.0	0.526597510833	You did.
0.0	0.5	And we will not, under this proposal, have a situation that we have right now with the Affordable Care Act where you have states like South Carolina, and many other Republican states, that because of their right wing political ideology, are denying millions of people the expansion of Medicaid that we passed in the Affordable Care Act.
0.0	0.483198474494	You know, a lot of business activity in America is conducted like the guy that does my dry cleaning.
0.0	0.478503956433	But what I did say was that the person who came in for the license needed to get it.
0.0	0.469738586326	Recognize that the caliphate is what gives them the legitimacy to go out on a jihadist mission, so we need to take that away from them.
0.0	0.412551156408	Look what they did in San Bernardino.
0.0	0.44335830721	Bernie Sanders, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.
0.0	0.457832961464	And I want to just suggest to you.
0.0	0.44213973245	Come with me to Iraq and Afghanistan, folks.
0.0	0.468483975354	You know, we -- we agree that we've got to get unaccountable money out of politics.
0.0	0.492793365567	And if at the end of 18 months, 24 months there are people who have been cleared, and I would prioritize widows, and orphans, and the elderly, people who may have relatives, families, or have nowhere else to go.
0.0	0.451146850719	It is the future of the world and the future of our children and grandchildren.
0.0	0.480515555221	We need, and only the three of us will do this, nobody on the Republican side will even admit there's a problem.
0.0	0.5	That is a dramatic tax decrease for hard-working people who run their own businesses.
0.0	0.489869320169	At the same time, law enforcement understands there are people in the community who not only think that the system doesn't work for them, but works against them.
0.0	0.490144977598	Well, first of all, this is an issue that's been debated now for 30 years.
0.0	0.479437851091	And here in Wisconsin, I want to reiterate: We've got to stand up for unions and working people who have done it before...
0.0	0.419914225	Here's -- here's our plan.
0.0	0.474835398337	And we have to take on ISIS online.
0.0	0.488655663245	We have -- wait a second, we have $19 trillion in debt.
0.0	0.471541337113	This country is changing.
0.0	0.469880170469	But, bottom line is this is the year 2015.
0.0	0.43889322744	... he's really doing some bad...
0.0	0.451269726979	It works very, very well.
0.0	0.446103688896	We're up 347,000 jobs.
0.0	0.449283094689	This would be devastating for the economy.
0.0	0.459210334363	Now, on to your substantive question.
0.0	0.492253447983	With grandiose language, the president talks about red lines and nothing to follow it up; talks about ISIS being the JV team, they form a caliphate the size of Indiana with 35 (thousand) to 40,000 battle-tested terrorists.
1.0	0.423995453347	They're rapists.
0.0	0.478506238212	This country is running out of time.
0.0	0.48123815289	Maybe we should focus on quality education with well-paid faculty members.
0.0	0.484762818395	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you had better get rid of the super PACs, because they're causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that are being made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.465480377782	This ties into campaign finance reform.
0.0	0.490628004434	You joined the Senate in voting to get rid of Gadhafi, and you asked that there be a Security Council validation of that with a resolution.
0.0	0.485961979009	... first of all, let me just tell you something -- and you know, because you just saw the numbers yourself -- NBC Wall Street Journal just came out with a poll -- headline: Trump way up, Cruz going down.
0.0	0.456332234544	You know, I find it really quite fascinating some of the president's proclamations.
0.0	0.431205268983	He wasn't my senator.
0.0	0.395374942555	It's a disaster.
0.0	0.437736881827	Here is the one thing I'm not going to do.
0.0	0.466545197694	Starting with our children and moving forward.
0.0	0.422207733101	I know how to do that.
0.0	0.450459115023	We're ready to start shooting."
0.0	0.450480453233	And, I'll do that with the country.
0.0	0.492789127495	He pays on his personal rate, and he is paying higher than the big dry-cleaning chain down the street, because he's paying at his personal rate.
0.0	0.5	It's tax-free -- a huge advantage for our farmers and ranchers and manufacturers -- and every import pays the 16 percent business flat tax.
0.0	0.381274630959	We have to be honest about it.
0.0	0.461841007568	And, you know, I don't know all the details of what Rick Snyder has done.
0.0	0.472953477541	Here is the major issue when we talk about Wall Street.
1.0	0.479573730287	And, that's with zero percent interest rates.
0.0	0.408113508662	I was a banker and I was proud of it.
0.0	0.477635832938	You see, because if you really want to get to a balanced budget, you need to reduce your expenses and you need to grow your economy.
0.0	0.435755634001	She's an American citizen.
0.0	0.489180753209	... saying, no middle class tax raises.
0.0	0.477781436659	So, just to sum up, I would do various things very quickly.
0.0	0.492310050308	Last quarter, it was just announced our gross domestic product -- a sign of strength, right?
0.0	0.494204560134	Imagine how hard it is for these people out there that are making 40, 50, $60,000 a year, and they're trying to provide for their families at a time when this economy is not growing.
0.0	0.467092808172	I think he would have said bring back a 21st-century Glass-Steagall legislation.
0.0	0.395374942555	SuperPacs are a disaster.
0.0	0.453670837683	That's why I've got such a good plan.
0.0	0.475408558171	No, both the federal and a state approach.
0.0	0.478030357916	Kissinger was one of those people during the Vietnam era who talked about the domino theory.
0.0	0.367994212245	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.448635971917	I don't think Ted can have it both ways.
0.0	0.451975837208	He is a good man.
0.0	0.411414150342	We have problems with Russia.
0.0	0.477561333801	And you better get rid of them because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.470571745797	You know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money.
0.0	0.45282633825	... and I'd like to respond.
0.0	0.460365483341	It's a disaster, and we have to protect Israel.
0.0	0.454529236353	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.43660204352	I know how hard that is.
0.0	0.473638298615	But you ought to acknowledge the government doesn't do a very good job at it.
0.0	0.402535860818	They are refusing to...
0.0	0.48214525223	We own a home four blocks away from the place that I grew up in.
0.0	0.412447223995	Why weren't they vigilant?
0.0	0.47129838641	Our best days are in front of us.
0.0	0.426701411024	I looked at the intelligence.
0.0	0.47430845847	Now, our country needs -- our country needs a truly great leader, and we need a truly great leader now.
0.0	0.477718772587	We need someone to fight for the people.
0.0	0.454531513778	I beat China all the time.
1.0	0.585151310307	You know, the amendment you're talking about is one sentence -- it's 38 words.
0.0	0.423619489288	And universities.
0.0	0.466219790519	We now finally are where we need to be.
0.0	0.479212264437	Well, first of all, it isn't the middle class.
0.0	0.471118073985	Not solely ours, but we must work collaboratively with other nations.
0.0	0.494420942102	So you don't get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.468234307626	I mean, let me be honest with the people who are watching at home.
0.0	0.461718267098	And, you know, we have a whole variety of things that they can do and they can do these things simultaneously.
1.0	0.5	Think about it: six and a half million people working part-time.
0.0	0.480301973894	And let me tell you, ISIS and terrorists do not get their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.526597510833	No.
0.0	0.48280643297	And I think -- and I think we bring together that broad coalition, including Russia, to help us destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.450194666307	I am still sick and tired of Hillary Clinton's e-mails.
0.0	0.48167570392	And I just want to say, you know, last week we released our tax plan.
0.0	0.45399356484	They wouldn't be there except for us.
0.0	0.5	We cut taxes and we had a $5 trillion projected surplus when I left.
0.0	0.471182110659	You want to see a war on women?
0.0	0.391215510429	The mentally ill?
0.0	0.459821104718	This is an interesting point when you talk about immigration.
0.0	0.480845276898	You also have to some strategically cutting in several places.
0.0	0.480226987221	No, what I said, Chris, was that the law needs to be followed.
0.0	0.472189499396	And just so -- if I could, because he insulted a lot of people.
0.0	0.442114201378	Good evening.
0.0	0.5	Marco's top tax rate is 35 percent.
0.0	0.475348042886	And it will have effects in the private market.
0.0	0.488492345306	In her world, cap- and-trade would dominate, that we will destroy the economy in the name of helping the environment.
0.0	0.458217071256	But, I would also add this.

0.0	0.485754198245	If they will begin to turn their military attention away from going after the adversaries of Assad toward ISIS and put the Assad future on the political and diplomatic track, where it belongs.
0.0	0.379223375735	I was for legalization.
0.0	0.473192628291	She'd be a great president of the United States because the leadership she brought to H.P.
0.0	0.483175754531	People died, and only three people have been fired.
0.0	0.482070653856	When I'm president of the United States we are getting rid of Obamacare and we are rebuilding our military.
0.0	0.461718284376	But bottom line is: The president is right.
0.0	0.373838660474	We haven't.
0.0	0.450149219478	Please think of our founding fathers as you listen.
0.0	0.480056245995	Well, Bret, first that's not entirely the story.
0.0	0.526597510833	...
0.0	0.442141909088	It ain't going to happen.
0.0	0.472200725007	Now, what the magic number is, I don't know, because we don't know the extent of the problem.
0.0	0.469388419491	We cannot let things get farther down the road, like we did with North Korea.
0.0	0.488814577491	It's what we did in the first Persian Gulf war; 1,100 air attacks a day, saturation bombing that utterly destroyed the enemy.
0.0	0.487493024038	I will immediately terminate President Obama's illegal executive order on immigration, immediately.
0.0	0.443391754077	There's a lot packed into that statement.
1.0	0.603452150318	I have long supported the proposition that we should lift the cap on taxable income coming into the Social Security Trust Fund, starting at $250,000.
0.0	0.468331673868	But I speak to border guards and they tell us what we're getting.
0.0	0.464312028443	Can I just say this...
0.0	0.457050421896	But here's the point I want to make tonight.
0.0	0.478713253935	... people all over this country -- not you, Secretary Clinton -- are shouting at each other.
0.0	0.5	And I spent my entire lifetime balancing federal budgets, growing jobs, the same in Ohio.
0.0	0.469107818042	First off, we can do all the great speeches we want but you're not going to succeed unless there is a consensus.
0.0	0.472115720241	... the American middle class, and who are being attacked by ideologues, by demagogues.
0.0	0.477247047436	But honestly, if you're a small business owner today you are being crushed.
0.0	0.476764880367	If they had guns, he wouldn't be around very long.
0.0	0.469964568288	But the final thing I want to say about this is the following.
0.0	0.480496189689	I am the only person in either campaign that's self-funding.
0.0	0.484619422572	What we need is leadership in this country which revitalizes American democracy, and makes people understand that if they stand up and fight back and take on the billionaire class, we can bring about the change that we need.
0.0	0.479594602262	We need to control the border, we need to do all of this in a comprehensive way, not just going back and forth and talking about stuff --
0.0	0.488016665718	Our waste water plants, our rail, our airports, in many places are disintegrating.
0.0	0.458838520114	Marco can change his mind.
0.0	0.477079386119	Reported it in the Wall Street Journal recently.
0.0	0.472335405872	It's the New York Times, they are always wrong.
0.0	0.472072582583	Hillary Clinton has never been responsible for those kind of decisions where they were held accountable.
0.0	0.482905267971	And this is beanbag compared to what the Clinton hit machine is going to do to the Republican nominee.
0.0	0.467394044303	We have all the cards, but we don't know how to use them.
0.0	0.494988694262	And what I think all of us are saying is, our monetary policy, our tax policy, regulatory policy needs to be radically changed so we can create high sustained growth for income to rise.
0.0	0.462153522326	I've been passionate my whole life about the Constitution.
0.0	0.449523129741	I don't think we're at war with Islam.
0.0	0.371633052654	Those are your enemies.
0.0	0.5	Over the last few weeks, I've listened to Jeb as he walked around the country and said that you're modeling your campaign after John McCain, that you're going to launch a furious comeback the way he did, by fighting hard in New Hampshire and places like that, carrying your own bag at the airport.
0.0	0.481724882545	That's why as commander in chief, I will take on ISIS, not only because it keeps us safe, but because it allows us to absolutely conduct our religious affairs the way we find in our heart and in our souls.
0.0	0.457426285484	But look, we didn't know what was happening next.
0.0	0.424936271317	I can do that.
0.0	0.489776626093	Now, the proposal that I have outlined, you know, should be familiar to you, because it is what essentially Barack Obama campaigned on in 2008.
0.0	0.5	In this administration, every weapon system has been gutted, in this administration, the force levels are going down to a level where we can't even project force.
0.0	0.482547043872	The first thing is we have to strengthen our alliances around the world.
0.0	0.459577315957	And our adversaries continue to grow stronger.
0.0	0.424029607988	We are all frustrated with what China is doing.
0.0	0.474835689104	Now, what I think is that right now we have got to do our best in developing positive relations with Russia.
0.0	0.48615362866	We ought to have politicians who not only have government experience but know how the CEOs and the job creators work.
0.0	0.321389529923	Thank you.
0.0	0.489967030064	When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York.
0.0	0.447810243947	And you have to really work hard at it.
0.0	0.412652779601	I understand.
1.0	0.629410975268	Who denies that African-American youth unemployment, real, is over 50 percent.
0.0	0.474534655464	They should have made it more open ended for the next president.
0.0	0.48154976424	Well, I have what I call the new college compact.
0.0	0.474887353254	As an example, I've been on the circuit making speeches, and I hear my fellow Republicans.
0.0	0.469798821585	And, I also just want to thank the audience for being attentive, and noticing the questions, and the noticing the answers.
0.0	0.463755207438	It's got great people, it's got loving people, wonderful people.
0.0	0.460698281079	And Bill said, "No, no, she hasn't."
0.0	0.491370799743	When I'm president, we are rebuilding the U.S. military because the world is a safer and a better place when America is the strongest military in the world.
0.0	0.450010753387	... And start taking advice...
0.0	0.490122648584	I visited with a number of our neighbors in Northern Virginia at a mosque last Friday.
0.0	0.45366411928	She is the best parent and grandmother that I know.
0.0	0.480641527539	And I've had many situations in the state of Ohio where we've had to move, whether it's storms, whether it was a horrible school shooting.
0.0	0.5	It would bring the money back into the United States to help build jobs by American companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about.
0.0	0.454587576254	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.460129917068	And we need someone who will take on Hillary Clinton in November.
0.0	0.526597510833	Have to do it.
0.0	0.48945863177	That will create a true 50-state national marketplace which will drive down the cost of low-cost, catastrophic health insurance.
0.0	0.472369012583	Well, let me be clear about one thing, there's only one savior and it's not me.
0.0	0.477648757355	Because if your faith causes you to care for the less fortunate, it is something you want to see in your public figures.
0.0	0.471116031546	It's also about choosing our next commander-in-chief.
0.0	0.4931270842	That is like shouting "fire" in a crowded theater, and that is illegal, and I would do everything in our power not just to go after those who are here who we know who are here, before they can radicalize other Americans to carry out attacks, and it's not just the ones they've arrested.
0.0	0.485520571928	Obviously, Mrs. Obama has been a terrific leader when it comes to young people's health, particularly nutrition and exercise.
0.0	0.475682772648	I believe that we should never give up our privacy; never should give up our freedoms in exchange for a promise of security.
0.0	0.436075777848	I was a governor during the 9/11 attack.
0.0	0.460040393374	But I...
0.0	0.459874181621	It will never happen because they'll let their currency go up.
0.0	0.488310944461	You look at California, you look, frankly, at Paris where there's a -- the strictest no-gun policy of any city anywhere in the world, and you see what happens: 130 people dead with many to follow.
0.0	0.441753185234	But I want to be frank about what I stand for.
0.0	0.461549108424	How the hell can you vote for this guy?
0.0	0.434366168603	I'm the only guy on this stage -- you know, everybody has an "only guy" -- "I'm the only guy this; I'm the only guy that."
0.0	0.5	I can tell you, after spending seven years as a former federal prosecutor, right after 9/11, dealing with this issue.
0.0	0.471921745944	Well, I think that there are different records.
0.0	0.452164668155	They built the great wall of China.
0.0	0.492442007276	And we just got to make sure that every American has the tools, in K-through-12 and in vocational education, in higher education.
0.0	0.43593913069	Yeah, he said everybody.
0.0	0.5	Well, again, I mean, obviously, as already has been pointed out, the only budget that Ted has ever voted for is a budget that Rand Paul sponsored that brags about cutting defense spending.
0.0	0.458601975388	I want to take care of women.
1.0	0.433082019579	It got stolen from them.
0.0	0.483540675185	Right now, Barack Obama is launching between 15 and 30 air attacks a day.
0.0	0.475831212038	I am running for president of the United States because it is too late for establishment politics and establishment economics.
0.0	0.469507817018	The Koch Brothers have a very clear political agenda.
0.0	0.48610951261	It is why we have to reduce the size and power of government.
0.0	0.321389529923	Thank you.
0.0	0.468516036296	The biggest bank in the world is from China.
0.0	0.475870236159	I think maybe my greatest weakness is that I trust people too much.
0.0	0.395374942555	It is a disaster.
0.0	0.422207733101	They know.
0.0	0.472718780746	We need to embed with -- with the Iraqi military.
0.0	0.483907814288	You didn't see these kind of ideas being batted around, and being batted around in a way that's civil and smart and that's trying to help to inform the voter out there.
0.0	0.5	Look, I am deeply concerned about what's happening in every community in America, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths.
0.0	0.458462463542	What we have to do is end over-policing in African- American neighborhoods.
0.0	0.475500950011	And there is no nation on the planet better able to adapt to this change than our nation.
0.0	0.487047209732	But they need to see leadership, support and resolve from the United States of America, and we can help them defeat ISIS.
0.0	0.321389529923	Thank you.
0.0	0.483464733187	Let us actually go to zero- based budgeting so we know where the money is being spent.
0.0	0.463073734307	Just get me a job.
0.0	0.473235527094	Now, I can tell you there are a lot of private-sector things that you could do with $12,500, which will get you a lot more than you get from this government program.
0.0	0.482113781264	Because part of this is the startup challenges that this system is facing.
0.0	0.457960634064	I said, "I don't need it.
0.0	0.473813976939	The first line of defense against radicalization is in Muslim-American community.
0.0	0.3880052222	There is a vacuum.
0.0	0.479647270506	Putting Iranian troops right on the border of the Golan right next to Israel would be a nonstarter for me.
0.0	0.490820813088	So conservatives actually do come out of Manhattan, including William F. Buckley and others, just so you understand.
0.0	0.41884380495	He's a gifted politician.
0.0	0.490299563102	So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States.
0.0	0.406925702935	A Republican Congress did that.
0.0	0.479999850839	They attacked us in San Bernardino two weeks ago.
0.0	0.526597510833	Both.
0.0	0.46002385568	We're going to end up in the same place.
0.0	0.491839806736	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.476142334471	I think he means somebody who hasn't been a career politician, and who's been out of office for awhile.
1.0	0.5	It says that after 35 million people have come here over the last 20 years, almost all of whom are unskilled workers, flattening wages, creating horrible opportunity -- a lack of opportunities for unskilled workers, we're going to do something about reducing the level of immigration by 25 percent.
0.0	0.488074304454	Well, I think you have to look at both the terrorism challenge that we face abroad and certainly at home and the role that guns play in delivering the violence that stalks us.
0.0	0.40893383155	He was on the board.
0.0	0.490282340824	Fully support and back up the Second Amendment.
1.0	0.41451034641	We passed it after 9/11.
0.0	0.469866803828	People were shocked, Trump got it.
0.0	0.47251456124	And if we can do that in Texas, that 12th largest economy in the world, we can do it in America.
0.0	0.44402190825	Well, I'm glad you asked that, Maria.
0.0	0.473587133042	Our healthcare is a horror show.
0.0	0.491387156037	It is a unique nation in all of human history and on the face of the planet, because here, our founders believed that everyone has a right to fulfill their potential and that that right --they called it life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness -- comes from God and cannot be taken away by government.
0.0	0.455673794306	-- the issue is who is going to get it done.
0.0	0.5	And when it began, we had no political organization, no money, and not much name recognition outside of the state of Vermont.
0.0	0.5	Or we're going to ship 10 million Americans -- or 10 million people out of this country, leaving their children here in this country and dividing families?
0.0	0.412474337611	I'm ready.
0.0	0.458312009796	So what if children are going hungry?
0.0	0.482786777658	You look at these airports, we are like a third world country.
0.0	0.492968494539	The law itself requires a background check, but that didn't fulfill their part of the bargain within the time that they were supposed to do.
0.0	0.4708686598	We've got the consensus, what we're lacking is political leadership...
0.0	0.489217005812	And I thought it was horrible when it was broadcast on television, because boy, does that send signals to Putin and all of the other people that look at us and they say, "That is a group of people, and that is a nation that truly has no clue.
0.0	0.487443351648	We need to lead a force, a Sunni led force inside of Syria.
0.0	0.526597510833	We do.
0.0	0.5	And my record was one of cutting taxes each and every year.
0.0	0.451668940368	We have a country of borders.
0.0	0.471925748242	If you can't make a good deal with a politician, then there's something wrong with you.
0.0	0.478430525345	And I think the reason he did is because immigration is sort of an example of what's broken and what's wrong in Washington, D..C.
0.0	0.460395640135	That is what the Democrats in the Senate have put forward as a proposal.
0.0	0.487606766535	Now, I recognize that the vast majority of people coming in here probably are not those kinds of people, but that's not good enough.
0.0	0.412868148225	I think that is...
0.0	0.490203549323	Clearly the best piece of veterans' legislation brought forth in decades.
0.0	0.469953415517	Oz Guinness, the theologian, said that liberty requires restraint but the only restraint consistent with liberty is self-restraint.
0.0	0.5	It was also the disbanding of many elements of the Iraqi army that are now showing up as part of ISIS.
0.0	0.487605477487	If we are going to be competitive in the global economy we need the best educated workforce.
0.0	0.485530984945	And my reading of the law and the Constitution convinces me that the President has the authority that he is attempting to exercise with respect to dreamers and their parents, because I think all of us on this stage agree that we need comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.494973629182	When ISIL does training videos that say the easiest way to get a combat assault weapon in the United States of America is at a gun show, then we should all be waking up.
0.0	0.489721739546	Bret, let me tell you, this is another one of those places where Hillary Clinton has so much to answer for, and why she is completely unqualified to be commander in chief.
0.0	0.472335098562	I used the laws of the country to my benefit, I'm sorry.
0.0	0.475794473033	Our enemies are getting stronger and stronger by the way, and we as a country are getting weaker.
1.0	0.586488823229	It absolutely has been, and at the time in the context of that was in 2009, and 2010, where the last effort for legalization was an effort done in the Senate.
0.0	0.471575280153	is exactly the leadership we need in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.468781796254	I'm going to be introducing a plan which I call the 2020 Perfect Vision for America.
0.0	0.494124376585	Yeah, but that -- because the math is, if you -- 5 percent of a million is a lot more than 5 percent of a thousand.
0.0	0.45508641784	Let's get rid of Assad later.
0.0	0.5	And Senator Sanders's plan really rests on making sure that governors like Scott Walker contribute $23 billion on the first day to make college free.
1.0	0.473372797074	They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us.
0.0	0.469250826705	We have artificially low interest rates.
0.0	0.456250694825	It did not come from our Judeo-Christian roots, I can tell you that.
0.0	0.433749414415	Yes, I agree.
0.0	0.443637996314	The Cold War is over.
0.0	0.434859348475	How are we gonna -- how are we gonna go back and make it great again?
0.0	0.440983643498	It's affordable for everybody.
0.0	0.45996924121	Nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with.
0.0	0.475678409077	I'm running hard and I believe I'll be the Republican nominee and I'll be the one best suited to beat Hillary Clinton, who should not be president of the United States.
0.0	0.440367451701	But we came together.
0.0	0.429126200303	I'm tested.
0.0	0.462703207654	I've dealt with them all my life.
0.0	0.479186014141	And the world's financial system is on the verge of collapse.
0.0	0.481714517811	In the last 30 years, there has been a massive redistribution of wealth.
0.0	0.447363146306	We ended up with 56 votes.
1.0	0.602070562172	Barack Obama actually had the poison pill to stop it then.
0.0	0.5	But at the same time with new technologies I believe that the people creating these projects -- I mean these products also have an obligation to come together with law enforcement to figure these things out; true to our American principles and values.
0.0	0.490820377332	We need to begin by undoing -- I would begin by undoing a whole set of things that President Obama has done, whether it's illegal amnesty or this latest round of EPA regulations.
0.0	0.413616956094	And that is wrong.
0.0	0.446360945716	Yeah, but let me respond...
0.0	0.436992479951	And we need to very, very concerned about that.
0.0	0.435579330178	I'm going to be independent.
0.0	0.494733220318	I've also called for the end of family detention, for the end of privately-run detention centers, along with private prisons, which I think are really against the common good and the rule of law.
0.0	0.486484994273	Could I -- could I bring something up here, because I'm a constituent of the senator and I helped him and I expected that he would do constituent service, which means that he shows up to work.
0.0	0.478355368037	Millions of people have high deductibles and co-payments.
0.0	0.476391787572	We need to have everybody in our country focused on watching what happens and reporting it if it's suspicious, reporting what you hear.
0.0	0.5	My father came to this country from Poland at the age of 17 without a nickel in his pocket, which sparked my interest in the need for immigration reform because I know what it's like to be the son of an immigrant.
0.0	0.490358523918	I've laid out a very aggressive plan to reign in Wall Street -- not just the big banks.
0.0	0.451739921222	A lot of interesting issues have come together.
0.0	0.466795610527	We have to come together as a country.
0.0	0.429184787943	The Syrians should stay in Syria.
0.0	0.474834779205	But we need an independent investigation, and I hope Secretary Clinton will agree with me for the need of that.
0.0	0.487472777164	I stood on the stage and watched Marco in rather indignantly, look at Governor Bush and say, someone told you that because we're running for the same office, that criticizing me will get you to that office.
0.0	0.457521256875	Why in God's name does Wall Street...
0.0	0.422207733101	And you know what?
0.0	0.482949984142	But our goal is, in fact, to try over a period of time to, in fact, deal with our enemies, not just ignore that reality.
0.0	0.476488929076	... having said that, I don't think I'm going to get a whole lot of campaign contributions from Wall Street.
1.0	0.575558305062	Strong, powerful men, young and people are looking at that and they're saying what's going on?
0.0	0.447382310369	And that's the way it is.
0.0	0.526597510833	We have to do it.
0.0	0.456749388487	All of those things are important, and all those things would happen in a Christie administration.
0.0	0.526597510833	No, I have not.
0.0	0.468615930389	Three specific reforms that reflect those principles.
0.0	0.422301430922	Yes.
0.0	0.457555076324	Let me agree with Governor O'Malley and let me agree with Secretary Clinton.
0.0	0.489735643205	We have so much natural gas now, and we can liquify it, and we can transfer it across the sea so we can make Europe dependent on us instead of Putin -- put him back in his little box where he belongs.
0.0	0.454325953508	I'm not going to cut it at all; I'm going to bring money in, and we're going to save it.
0.0	0.477321471031	We've saved billions of dollars.
0.0	0.47599948506	We have to go after price gouging and monopolistic practices and get Medicare the authority to negotiate.
0.0	0.490599101896	And the people who are getting hammered are small businesses, it's single moms, it's Hispanics.
0.0	0.483146926835	I mean, she would drive a car until it wouldn't make a sound, and then gather up all her coins and buy a new car.
0.0	0.452740104601	Kevin, if I could just jump in.
0.0	0.5	Just last week, we see saw two Iraqi refugees vetted using the same process the president says will work, that were arrested for being alleged ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.451000325745	I didn't want guns.
0.0	0.452017259975	Instead, we're listening to the bickering back and forth.
0.0	0.484491078006	So let's move toward what we should be doing as a nation and follow the values of our immigration history and begin to make it possible for them to come out of the shadows and to have a future that gives them a full chance of citizenship.
0.0	0.471758826377	And I will do all that I can in this campaign to reach out and explain what I stand for and what I will do as president.
0.0	0.46379772062	Neil, Neil -- can I say one thing about this.
0.0	0.492530979827	And I'll tell you why, last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee, she admitted she had sent emails to her family saying, hey, this attack in Benghazi was caused by al Qaeda-like elements.
0.0	0.480461397001	But, what we did is we said to the working families of this country, look, we know things are tough, but if you want to help us go beyond establishment politics, and establishment economics, send us something.
0.0	0.448383396914	We're running surpluses.
0.0	0.5	Absolutely, they should fight to fund -- defund Planned Parenthood, and I don't think the president should shut down the government simply to send our taxpayer dollars to this group.
0.0	0.459107476053	Let me just say this...
0.0	0.494439915805	If I could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited.
0.0	0.321389529923	Thank you.
0.0	0.39847947423	No, absolutely not.
0.0	0.47836094498	There is a radical jihadist group that is manipulating our immigration system.
0.0	0.470479391169	Well, there is no evidence that they can fix anything in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.486155506383	Well, they're the ones not listening to the scientists today, because doctors say that at 20 weeks that is a viable life inside the womb.
0.0	0.463626390056	What I've always said is that this issue does need to be solved.
0.0	0.4879161854	Let's create an America that works for all of us, not the handful on top.
0.0	0.461888759377	Here's the way you need to deal with it.
0.0	0.485044057684	And everything is costing more money, and we are killing our -- our -- our people like this.
0.0	0.430882475111	I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.472661701381	The young officer who was killed responding to the Planned Parenthood murders.
1.0	0.483608193765	Twenty-one mass shootings, including one last weekend in Des Moins where three were murdered.
0.0	0.442598162484	No criminal records for them.
0.0	0.480550866482	You know, what people are frustrated about in Washington, D.C.., and I know the folks out there tonight are incredibly frustrated because what they see is a government that doesn't work for them.
0.0	0.490557886986	But I think there has to be recognition that if we -- if we are too punitive, then you'll go to other -- other technology companies outside the United States.
0.0	0.48291218008	And, of course, we have to continue to do what is necessary when someone like Gadhafi, a despot with American blood on his hands, is overturned.
0.0	0.444124418217	Can you believe this?
0.0	0.480898222861	Who do you know will stop amnesty and secure the borders?
0.0	0.446034643889	How stupid are our leaders?
0.0	0.45275667797	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.472173076075	And so when we talk to our allies and we give them our word, in a Christie administration, they know we're going to keep it.
0.0	0.461480982515	But I think it is really unfair to suggest that I have not been supportive of the president.
0.0	0.454715543202	You know, you look at what's going on, you see all the divisiveness and the hatred that goes on in our society.
0.0	0.491426775707	We need to bring together our European and our Sunni Arab allies, and we need to develop a strategy together to take on ISIS every place that it is around the world, so that together, all of us can take ISIS out, destroy it, and then move on to come back to our country, protect our homeland security and make sure that the American people are safe.
0.0	0.435860616399	... issues they have to respond to.
0.0	0.471624220523	I'm a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.469130673958	We expand Medicare to all people.
0.0	0.483959415852	... that suspends all refugees from nations that ISIS or Al Qaida controls significant territory.
1.0	0.488700400101	In fact, climate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism.
0.0	0.493338072356	I just read today in the New York Times, $250,000 for a 30 second ad.
0.0	0.465793783865	We went after those who had attacked us.
0.0	0.487897561111	In the 1980s, it was in Beirut, Lebanon, under President Reagan's administration, and 258 Americans, marines, embassy personnel, and others were murdered.
0.0	0.474821893682	Ohio, one of the best growing places in the country -- I not only did it in Washington, I did it in Ohio, and I'll go back to Washington, and there will be no more silly deals...
0.0	0.45931203269	A growth of 385,000 jobs.
0.0	0.470456674412	Secondly, we've got to go after everything from North Africa to South Asia and beyond.
0.0	0.472164599606	I still want to get back to health care, because I think that's a worthy topic to explore.
0.0	0.431721613735	You get the Congress.
0.0	0.467623812156	Well, I got it for two reasons.
0.0	0.461142889979	So -- you know, you shouldn't misrepresent how well you're doing with the polls.
0.0	0.489996654984	Everybody's record's going to be scrutinized, and at the end of the day we need to unite behind the winner so we can defeat Hillary Clinton, because she is a disaster.
0.0	0.443916106752	And yes, I am angry.
0.0	0.462855240133	And that's what we should focus on is the violence in our communities.
0.0	0.459916740463	I've got a track record.
0.0	0.473506948413	Oh yeah, we want to elect a good president, but America is great from the bottom-up, and the bottom-up is us in our families, in our communities, in our neighborhoods.
0.0	0.456935412993	If I could just respond.
0.0	0.486180552835	If there's an act of violence in America, his immediate answer before he even knows the facts is gun control.
0.0	0.466810732263	He was kind of a conservative guy in many respects.
0.0	0.472896956863	Now, let me ask you a question everybody, and, this is for the guy, you know, who owns a landscaping business out there.
0.0	0.442862281271	You look at the patches and the 40-year-old floor.
0.0	0.478037602325	And I would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country.
0.0	0.4545548654	His family certainly believes that.
0.0	0.441842145013	You have all of these disastrous airports.
0.0	0.484028750197	That comes out to $12,500 for each one.
0.0	0.466012594878	... we will secure the border...
0.0	0.5	But there is no substitute for having comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship for 11 million people, many of whom have known no other country but the United States of America.
0.0	0.445965219421	Of course, they would.
0.0	0.463292429846	Lehman Brothers was not a big bank.
0.0	0.481721412027	Let's allow companies to immediately expense.
0.0	0.423896306088	No, that's -- you're wrong.
0.0	0.472080403308	He makes that deal, Israel maybe won't exist very long.
0.0	0.460260787079	Well John, wait a minute.
0.0	0.46839562231	I want to ask the people of the audience.
0.0	0.437932958516	Let me translate that for you.
0.0	0.442887443716	We've got nothing.
0.0	0.488936510037	But we have a unique time in America to connect with people all around the world that understand that there's an existential threat against all of them, the Arabs, the Jordanians, the Saudis, the Egyptians, our friends in Europe, including the Turks.
0.0	0.473957853232	I was governor on September 11th, and I'm proud of my leadership in bringing New York through that time.
0.0	0.477792404678	What we should do is to be investing in all types of energy, John, all types of energy.
0.0	0.462153856669	I think after 11 hours, that's pretty clear, yes.
0.0	0.422301430922	Yes.
0.0	0.5	But what the DNC did arbitrarily without discussing it with us is shut off our access to our information crippling our campaign.
0.0	0.460759018774	...and that do not allow us to pursue victory.
1.0	0.476184577066	I think we need to stop taking our advice from economists on Wall Street...
0.0	0.469846416716	But probably that was the most challenging because there was no certainty attached to it.
0.0	0.5	That is why they're building an -- right now, developing long- range missiles capable of reaching the United States, and that is why there's going -- they're going to use those $100 billion to expand their conventional capabilities and to one day buy or build a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.470144567626	We are in a war against ISIS.
0.0	0.468049749337	We need to reform Social Security.
0.0	0.478093039863	When I am president of the United States, I'm going to side with Ronald Regan on this and not Nancy Pelosi and we are not having a vat tax.
0.0	0.486619118166	So the total is $8,737,540,00.
0.0	0.467131486152	Give people a chance.
0.0	0.466962740874	And I -- I thought, if I didn't jump in, I might not be able to tell everybody this.
0.0	0.455803660722	You know, this is not easy work.
1.0	0.585133193876	One, Senator Sanders voted in 1998 on what I think is fair to call a regime change resolution with respect to Iraq, calling for the end of Saddam Hussein's regime.
0.0	0.476197553004	I don't remember you ever complaining about John McCain's vote record.
0.0	0.45849073896	But you know, here's the real issue, is this America anymore?
0.0	0.5	And there is only one person on this stage who voted to take away authority from the SEC and the Commodities Future Trading Commission that they could no longer regulate what are called swaps and derivatives, which actually contributed to the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and that was Senator Sanders.
0.0	0.439924619604	This is a war for the soul of Islam.
0.0	0.488521651897	I believe the world is a safer and a better place when America is the strongest power in the world.
0.0	0.438582506787	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.453093375224	But it could be he'd want to be cool, and he'll wait until the next day.
0.0	0.526597510833	It is.
0.0	0.5	I think to be commander in chief in the 21st century requires someone who understands how the economy works, someone who understands how the world works and who's in it; I know more world leaders on the stage today than anyone running, with the possible exception of Hillary Clinton; understands bureaucracies, how to cut them down to size and hold them accountable; and understands technology, which is a tool, but it's also a weapon that's being used against us.
0.0	0.464821814536	Our role in the world is to make ourselves a beacon of hope.
0.0	0.485365020929	I am not a single- issue candidate, and I do not believe we live in a single-issue country.
0.0	0.43199961116	It should always be going up.
0.0	0.479081188992	It's "give me options on how I can make it harder for law-abiding people to buy guns."
0.0	0.493642876548	Chris, in 1981, when Ronald Reagan came to the Oval Office, he encountered a military that had been debilitated just as the current military has, just like Jimmy Carter weakened our readiness, undermined our ability to defend this country, so too has Barack Obama.
0.0	0.471578696142	He is not the only one.
0.0	0.463414506744	Sit down with people like John Mccain.
0.0	0.487602074265	And as president I would expand enormous energy, literally call every member of Congress that I thought I could persuade.
0.0	0.41655441657	I got that.
0.0	0.392861566548	On welfare.
0.0	0.471589949421	Number one, he won't want to give up his lifestyle."
0.0	0.467947985639	It isn't "I put money in, I'm getting it back."
1.0	0.451691565057	They built a hotel.
0.0	0.435275134265	And I'll tell you, it was heartbreaking.
0.0	0.476968711305	You can't do that without the cooperation of the Muslim world because they're as threatened as we are.
0.0	0.453426140643	... (inaudible) opening statement.
0.0	0.464820968034	And it's going to get worse, because remember, Obamacare really kicks in in '16, 2016.
0.0	0.48106927608	I learned so much just sitting at his feet playing with blocks listening to him negotiate with subcontractors.
0.0	0.445433877448	Not a very pleasant place to be.
0.0	0.479278210772	I think it's a big thing that our party needs to be part of, and I've been a leader in Congress on trying to bring about criminal justice reform.
0.0	0.5	Two of them were among the most highly decorated -- they weren't allowed on a military base to have guns.
0.0	0.5	What these Chaldean families told me was that their families in Syria, when ISIS moves into their town, they actually paint a red cross across the door and mark their homes for demolition, and that tells the family you'd better get out now.
0.0	0.321389529923	Thank you.
1.0	0.484064220362	We borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.485594174532	Then you have to get rid of Larry Kudlow, who sits on your panel, who's a great guy, who came out the other day and said, I love Trump's tax plan.
0.0	0.526597510833	...
0.0	0.485097537252	We should use the debt ceiling, as precisely to Don, to force upon them budgetary reforms.
0.0	0.441015806787	Well, you're talking about -- yeah.
0.0	0.472115964928	Well, that just wasn't -- that just wasn't the fact, Senator.
0.0	0.455393156162	I have a difference of opinion with Secretary Clinton on this.
0.0	0.46552661197	And we must work more closely with Muslim-American communities.
0.0	0.464479561192	So don't put people in there if you don't want them bombed.
0.0	0.472986720275	We have a stock market that, frankly, has been good to me, but I still hate to see what's happening.
0.0	0.465361683879	They issue two-thirds of the credit cards and one-third of the mortgages.
0.0	0.463387480747	Stop the Washington bull and let's get things done.
0.0	0.476101010366	Number two, this isn't me saying it.
0.0	0.451313697348	And the fact is it was wrong.
0.0	0.487830681434	I also am very committed to getting the price of drugs down.
0.0	0.387153629493	And I'm glad I did it.
0.0	0.467672631702	And let me make a final point on this.
0.0	0.486624121247	We can end sanctuary cities by cutting off...
0.0	0.5	If elected president, I will do everything I can to expand Social Security benefits, not just for seniors, but for disabled veterans, as well.
0.0	0.462834671409	He was putting his 10 and 12-year-old boys to bed the other night.
0.0	0.491393851192	Millions of people are going to have to stand up, turn off the TV, get involved in the political process and tell the big- money interest that we are taking back our country.
0.0	0.442119535876	I think something has to change.
0.0	0.472915585599	Got to go to Haiti last year.
0.0	0.487160662135	Well, we've gotta turn the economy around for people who are struggling.
0.0	0.442758175792	Look, here is the reality, folks.
0.0	0.466244141136	Thanks for coming back to me, Maria.
0.0	0.485954280583	That, I think, between the two of us demonstrates the strength of the support we have among people who want to see change in our country.
0.0	0.5	Well, first of all, when we talk about the Import Export Bank, it's time to clean up corporate welfare.
0.0	0.486247380688	And we need to change the way we do law enforcement, and of course, we need more programs and facilities, so when somebody is ready to get help, there's a place for them to go.
1.0	0.60545769773	You used to support legalizing people that were here illegally, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.478855564475	You see what the Saudi's -- deliver them a strong message but at the end of the day we have to keep our cool because most of the time they're going right with us.
0.0	0.5	I would certainly tackle the cost issues, because I think that once the foundation was laid with a system to try to get as many people as possible into it, to end insurance discrimination against people with preexisting conditions or women, for example, that, yes, we were going to have to figure out how to get more competition in the insurance market, how to get the costs of -- particularly, prescription drugs, but other out-of-pocket expenses down.
0.0	0.417240963776	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.479344829165	The time to turn the page is now.
0.0	0.454767962497	It -- it doesn't need to be that way.
0.0	0.42788666406	I used the tithing analogy.
0.0	0.480350493397	I believe I can get the money that I need by taxing the wealthy, by closing loopholes, the things that we are way overdue for doing.
0.0	0.439604854332	It is a tragedy all over this country.
0.0	0.48686533577	And I stood alongside Jeff Sessions and Steve King, and we led the fight against amnesty.
0.0	0.479634596885	And we didn't put a single boot on the ground, and Gaddafi was deposed.
0.0	0.5	I think it's only fair to put on the record, Senator Sanders voted in the Senate for a resolution calling for ending the Gadhafi regime and asking that the U.N. be brought in, either a congressional vote or a U.N. Security Council vote.
0.0	0.489627606702	Governor Huckabee's exactly right, we need to honor the promises made to our seniors, but for younger workers -- look.
0.0	0.482542195824	We need a leader who will lead the resurgence of this great nation and unlock its potential once again.
0.0	0.430761256047	We saw a dictator overthrown.
0.0	0.484082831374	Hardworking immigrant families living in fear, who should be brought out of the shadows so they and their children can have a better future.
0.0	0.451503532981	Where did that spirit come from in America?
0.0	0.420099862173	Not bad.
0.0	0.416838253845	Let's...
0.0	0.484840812525	And he stood before the American people and he said, "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself," a profound statement that gave the American people the courage to believe that, yes, we could get out of that terrible depression.
0.0	0.454385685586	Ask Boeing.
0.0	0.482601517929	First and foremost, this issue has to be now more than anything else about keeping America safe.
0.0	0.461816191778	But it cannot be an American fight.
0.0	0.426615979437	I'm going to tell you -- thank you.

0.0	0.5	And, Jim, you know full well that in the seven years I was U.S. attorney we went after pharmaceutical companies.
0.0	0.480375574358	Because we have to stop doing things for some people, but for this country, it's destroying our country.
0.0	0.457254957713	They are -- they're in a position where they're smothering people.
1.0	0.477953398937	I've used it three times, maybe four times.

0.0	0.5	With Saudi Arabia and oil production, first of all, it's so critical for us to be energy independent, and we're getting there because of fracking and we ought to explore because, see, energy independence gives us leverage and flexibility, and secondly, if you want to bring jobs back to the United States of America in industry, low prices make the difference.
0.0	0.466009271432	We were behind where we were today.

0.0	0.490657099485	Millions coming out of school as you indicated, deeply in debt.
0.0	0.491889767201	But there wasn't a single day as mayor of Baltimore that I wasn't asked whether I was delivering on the promise I made to police the police.
0.0	0.493374121081	Why is it that the United States of America today is the only major country on earth that does not guarantee health care to all people as a right?

0.0	0.472852741989	We need to rebuild the military to defeat the enemy.
0.0	0.488124001349	The fact is what we need is someone on that stage who has been tested, who has been through it, who has made decisions, who has sit (ph) in the chair of consequence and can prosecute the case against Hillary Clinton on...
0.0	0.437096966245	We haven't done so.
0.0	0.485067406791	You see, why are we one of the most generous people in the world -- no, the most generous people in the world?
0.0	0.442326914448	But I can tell you this.
0.0	0.482385567067	And so, now that, I think, you know, we have resolved your data, we have agreed on an independent inquiry, we should move on.
0.0	0.48980227934	I also said that we should take increased numbers of refugees.
0.0	0.424552258597	We have not provided them.
0.0	0.467107090641	White people?

0.0	0.469876524515	I'm joined tonight by two daughters, Tara and Grace.
0.0	0.5	But we have to also go after the gun lobby and 92 percent of Americans agree we should have universal background checks.
0.0	0.459545314716	So I'm confident if I win this nomination, I will aggressively go against her and beat her.
0.0	0.47697107634	But the other thing I just wanted quickly to say is, I think President Obama deserves more credit than he gets for what he got done in Washington, despite the Republican obstructionists.
0.0	0.482381360932	All young people who have the ability should be able to get a college education.
0.0	0.478947552575	In the same light, as the foreign leader, Winston Churchill's politics were not my politics.
0.0	0.465381175822	We have a serious problem with, as you know, with radical Islam.
0.0	0.417341972965	When I was 22, my dad died.

0.0	0.445755883187	Can we stop?
0.0	0.491333875174	But the real number, the real number is anywhere from 18 to 19 and maybe even 21 percent, and nobody talks about it, because it's a statistic that's full of nonsense.
0.0	0.5	I believe that we pay for many of the things that we need to do again as a nation, investing in the skills of our people, our infrastructure, and research and development and also climate change by the elimination of one big entitlement that we can no longer afford as a people, and that is the entitlement that many of our super wealthiest citizens feel they are entitled to pay -- namely, a much lower income tax rate and a lower tax rate on capital gains.

0.0	0.472061776727	And I have set forth a compact that would do just that for debt-free tuition.
0.0	0.417462414092	Are you not running?
0.0	0.480157321982	You can trust me to do the following: that when I get on change with Hillary Clinton, we won't be debating about the science, we'll be debating about the solutions.
0.0	0.472522677672	We don't have to have refugees come to our country, but all Muslims, seriously?
0.0	0.481371004658	We've got to eliminate the gun show loophole.
0.0	0.487813556767	Community- based businesses and farms are getting crushed.
0.0	0.44305752147	Unless you are clinically insane...
0.0	0.481411149238	We're not going to fix what ails our economy, we're not going to make wages go up for everyone by either trying to replace American capitalism with socialism -- which, by the way, the rest of the world is moving away from -- nor will we fix it by submitting to sort of Wall Street-directed crony capitalism.
0.0	0.490043212127	It means, come out from the shadows, pay a fine, earn legal status by working, by paying taxes, learning English.
0.0	0.483345798871	We have the Russians and the Iranians working together, not to fight ISIS, but to prop up Assad.
1.0	0.475811008627	That's long-term debt, very low interest rates.
0.0	0.473123630313	But to destroy ISIS, it is necessary.
0.0	0.46850309415	You know, before it was called Obamacare, it was called Hillarycare.
0.0	0.436832371343	Becky --
0.0	0.466238230175	I think I'm going to win fair and square (inaudible) to win this way.
0.0	0.457964736375	We're going to have people come in, but they're coming in legally.
1.0	0.487262140943	Workforce participation rates lower than they were in 1977.
0.0	0.48331826042	And together we make it possible for a new generation of young people to refinance their debt and not come out with debt in the future.
0.0	0.488048900878	And many of the fights that are going on are not ones that the United States has either started or have a role in.
0.0	0.480501824155	Donald is right that China is running over President Obama like he is a child, President Obama is not protecting American workers and we are getting hammered.
0.0	0.476731058529	Let me tell you, if we don't get this election right, there may be no turning back for America.
0.0	0.479881823291	I released 34 years of tax returns...
0.0	0.488289567295	Where I see the weakness is in those three people that are left on the Democratic stage.
0.0	0.442664368267	This is a terribly complicated issue.
0.0	0.490514882912	If you look at a single mom buying groceries, she sees hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent.
0.0	0.485998335223	They will never again support it, and that's wrong for our country, bad for our future.
0.0	0.321389529923	Thank you.
0.0	0.479742739922	It will create a manufacturing juggernaut in this country.
0.0	0.461122881257	I'm running for president because there is no way we can elect Hillary Clinton to continue the policies of Barack Obama.
1.0	0.614835562588	And what that's led to over $2 trillion of American companies' monies that are being kept offshore, because they don't want to pay the second tax.
0.0	0.452966612904	We need to be doing military exercises if not only Estonia but Latvia and Lithuania.
0.0	0.422301430922	Yes.
0.0	0.449022504153	Such a nasty -- such a nasty question, but thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.492593767395	At the same time, we know that in many parts of our country police officers are bridging those divides and they're acting heroically.
1.0	0.582744762107	Ronald Regan opposed the value tax because he said it was a way to blindfold the people, so the true cost of government was not there there for them.
0.0	0.461512959628	You know, I think my biggest weakness is exactly the opposite.
0.0	0.5	What we need to do is lead an international coalition which includes very significantly the Muslim nations in that region who are going to have to fight and defend their way of life.
0.0	0.442318858434	All of you in Iowa, I need you to caucus for me.
0.0	0.472235630125	Terrorism in this country scares everyone.
0.0	0.487285969842	ISIS is a group that burns people alive in cages; that sells off little girls as brides.
0.0	0.483307468849	And recognizing that it's so important, this election, because we're talking about America for the people versus America for the government.
0.0	0.472097764246	I want to build on and improve the Affordable Care Act.
1.0	0.626634562353	Millions of Americans have lost their jobs, have been forced into part-time work, have lost their health insurance, have lost their doctors, have seen their premiums skyrocket.
0.0	0.474141997664	Well, the role has been defined by each person who's held it.
0.0	0.476483983588	In my world, we'll focus on energy independence and a clean environment.
0.0	0.464836062551	We have people that aren't smart.
0.0	0.481744425957	We did it, and it worked, and nobody headed for the hills or left the state because of it.
1.0	0.59152593416	There was a breach because the DNC vendor screwed up, information came to our campaign.
0.0	0.47876571899	I do, however, believe in Reagan's 11th commandment, and will not be engaging in awful things about my compatriots here.
0.0	0.4523301223	A military island.
0.0	0.459436777948	So when Nikki said that, I wasn't offended.
0.0	0.461961517233	It's interesting that Jeb mentions the book.
0.0	0.481585326154	We have a budget closer to $3.5 trillion.
0.0	0.481617939948	You don't solve it by big talk where you're banning all Muslims and making it harder for us to build the kind of coalition for us to be successful.
0.0	0.484007158504	There is a bill sitting in the House that would actually pass and have us go to zero-based budgeting so we know where every dime of your money is being spent instead of only talking about how much more we're going to spend year after year after year.
0.0	0.475924091174	For example, before you hire anyone from abroad, you should have to advertise that job for 180 days.
0.0	0.482682408862	... and I think -- you know, Governor -- Jeb, you -- the attack that -- the authorization that Barack Obama asked for was not against ISIS.
0.0	0.482089899813	People in Washington think they were sent there to be adults and govern and do all this.
0.0	0.474818099677	And I think the focus ought to be on making sure that we leave this nomination process, as wild and woolly as it's going to be -- this is not being bad.
0.0	0.486270181657	And that's what you'll hear from Hillary Clinton -- and I've already heard from her -- is that, send more money in Social Security, send more money in Medicare taxes, send more money for Medicaid, and that's gonna solve the problem.
0.0	0.479621978839	That we work with allies around the world to protect democratic values.
0.0	0.481624369264	We even had warnings about the Boston Marathon bombers, and yet the dots weren't connected.
0.0	0.457525553764	We need to do more on the prescribing end of it.
0.0	0.475710418561	David, look, this is the big -- I agree, by the way, that we should have paid family leave.
1.0	0.474065615912	I don't recall the Sun -- in fact, the Sun-Sentinel endorsed him.
0.0	0.379973180013	... an agreement with the...
0.0	0.474274036651	What we need to do is destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.465612326679	You don't know it, they tax us.
0.0	0.462927718812	I saw Reagan do it, I've seen other presidents do it.
0.0	0.471723785466	And the politicians always say it is so complicated, nobody but a politician can figure it out.
0.0	0.4491940258	If this all works out, I'm happy to consider naming you as V.P.
0.0	0.457586974012	And I agree with Senator Sanders on that.
0.0	0.485628501854	For example, all right, who in America denies that we have an infrastructure that is crumbling?
0.0	0.457541573851	Let the states do this.
0.0	0.494398083108	Number one, we do have more people who have access to health care.
0.0	0.492373238716	That expertise needs to spread all across the government and there needs to be much more cooperation with our private sector.
0.0	0.471581583878	John, this is another one of those examples.
0.0	0.423489033576	I will do that in Washington.
0.0	0.480633462307	Well, you know, governor, I know that when you had a chance to appoint a commissioner for financial regulation, you chose an investment banker in 2010.
0.0	0.485313912338	You know, I listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas.
0.0	0.466427474562	That we do all that we can to create a world of peace and prosperity.
0.0	0.471424488645	Which is what we're gonna get if we elect a big government liberal like Hillary Clinton to the White House.
0.0	0.493197515242	Well, I think, Judy, what has to be appreciated is that, as a result of the disastrous and illegal behavior on Wall Street, millions of lives were hurt.
0.0	0.459435570742	But let me say one more thing.
0.0	0.472777392805	So you know the New York Times and I don't have exactly have the warmest of relationships.
0.0	0.490914243905	And having been in New Hampshire and here in Iowa, but in New Hampshire, I just received the support of seven out of eight of the newspapers in that state because they see positive, they see unity, they see coming together, and they see a record of change and a record of accomplishment.
0.0	0.465466305451	Well, I am going to answer your question, Neil.
0.0	0.481690824018	But the bottom line is we must have virtue, we must have a religious bearing as a nation.
0.0	0.449251708625	They explode the bomb, we have an electromagnetic pulse.
1.0	0.621730587248	When that war began, we had 529 ships.
0.0	0.450444328073	Obama is going to be out playing golf.
0.0	0.472174932107	That's essentially what we have now, and we don't need that.
0.0	0.420886915793	In addition to that...
0.0	0.470185340536	They went to the DNC quietly.
1.0	0.5	Becky, if you want a 10 percent flat tax where the numbers add up, I rolled out my tax plan today, you can find it on line at tedcruz.org.
0.0	0.488321887255	Well, first of all, let's understand why we are even having this debate and why Donald tapped in to some of that anger that's out there about this whole issue.
0.0	0.477458923842	It's the evil government that is -- that is putting all these regulations on us so that we can't survive.
0.0	0.5	And so what I have proposed, number one, is a $5,000 tax credit to help people who have very large out-of-pocket costs be able to afford those.
0.0	0.470748106465	The truth is that sentencing for blacks is higher than for whites.
0.0	0.473828325964	And we're going to just fix everything with waste, fraud, and abuse?
0.0	0.469707038909	I am not a member of the political class.
0.0	0.478654734505	The agreement on a cease-fire, though, is something that has to be implemented more quickly than the schedule that the Russians agreed to.
0.0	0.492546405502	There're families all across America who aren't able to contribute to our economy because of this crushing student loan.
0.0	0.448965565462	It better not be Bernie Sanders.
0.0	0.443669501027	They have a responsibility, as well.
0.0	0.5	As a governor we actually made the greater investments so that we could go four years in a row without a penny's increase to college tuition.
0.0	0.47386206462	And I cannot wait to earn the opportunity to do it because she cannot be the president of the United States.
0.0	0.484279783578	But the process should move forward while we are also taking on ISIS, putting together the kind of strategy that I've advocated for, and making sure that the vetting and the screening is as tough as possible.
0.0	0.5	One, with respect to the Central American children, I made it very clear that those children needed to be processed appropriately, but we also had to send a message to families and communities in Central America not to send their children on this dangerous journey in the hands of smugglers.
0.0	0.526597510833	This is 2016.
0.0	0.46329556793	Look, this is a tragedy for New Hampshire.
0.0	0.488461785556	Just the other day, Russia allowed a television camera to see the plans for a drone submarine that could carry a tactical nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.478628776036	But today, we're the only nation on the planet that's saddling our kids with a lifetime of bills.
0.0	0.452385299642	Hillary Clinton lies about Benghazi, she lies about e- mails.
0.0	0.487834314027	Because when government gets big and powerful, the big feel like they need to get even bigger to deal with all that power, and meanwhile, the small and the powerless -- in this case, 1,590 community banks -- go out of business.
0.0	0.454918285656	I think more of it is coming and it's going to grow.
0.0	0.373838660474	I didn't.
0.0	0.489167587843	So I think, at a time when so many of our kids are desperately looking for constructive activity, where too many of our kids are hanging around on street corners, potentially getting into trouble, I think we need a forceful advocate for the children, for teenagers, for the little children, to deal with the dysfunctional child care system, and I think my wife would do a great job in helping me accomplish those goals.
1.0	0.456278608948	The Oregon study showed this.
0.0	0.404691189003	The answer is no.
0.0	0.466426747376	The immediate -- it is not Assad who is attacking the United States.
0.0	0.467387942604	I think President Obama has set a great example.
0.0	0.493237636244	But also the biggest people (ph) -- now I've used that to my advantage as a business man, for my family, for myself.
0.0	0.476790378648	Our next president, and our Republican nominee can not be someone who supports those positions.
0.0	0.479762068397	And I will go back and say again, AIG was not a big bank.
0.0	0.480048291813	What I believe has got to happen is there must be an international coalition, including Russia, a well-coordinated effort.
0.0	0.465100817957	Who do you know will defend life, marriage and religious liberty?
0.0	0.480442368656	And if we capture any of them alive, they are getting a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know.
0.0	0.483128487911	So as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and the like.
0.0	0.478266234381	We're soon going to be at $20 trillion.
0.0	0.463089801898	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.490015964809	I agree with President Obama who used executive orders to protect families because the Congress, the House was unable or refused to act.
0.0	0.471828624178	Well, I believe, and I know that if Iowa helps make me the Republican nominee, I will defeat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.471086041177	I think what's interesting about where that liberty vote goes that my father brought to the Republican Party is, I don't think they're necessarily going to go for Ted.
0.0	0.5	But look, there's one big entitlement we can no longer afford as a country, and that is the entitlement that the super wealthy among us, those earning more than a million dollars, feel that they're entitled to pay lower income tax rates and a far lower preferred income tax rate when it comes to capital gains.
0.0	0.459929274927	Nobody can solve it like me.
0.0	0.439448392374	Bernie Sanders is a socialist.
1.0	0.442496639217	He's not wall street.
0.0	0.483749236866	And I said, "Didn't you resent America for not letting you be with your father in those formative and very threatening years?"
0.0	0.478158394617	That's the establishment telling us to hide our conservative principles to get the left and the media to like us.
0.0	0.478228048646	We have a lot of work to do with Iran before we ever say that they could move toward normalized relations with us.
0.0	0.457581286483	I never said that.
0.0	0.454339250072	Fiscal discipline, know what you're doing.
0.0	0.38149981626	It's not constitutional.
0.0	0.48350032193	Fired, never hired again and probably shunned in their community.
0.0	0.481769255062	We need somebody who can balance budgets, cut taxes...
0.0	0.46466598455	That never works.
0.0	0.470945370683	I think he was probably the most honest man in politics that we've ever seen in a generation.
0.0	0.485610211863	She worked -- and many of us supported you -- in trying to rebuild that devastation.
0.0	0.475563760517	And the reasons why I've done is I don't believe we have a good process of being able to vet them.
0.0	0.47632063716	I voted against the war in Iraq because I listened very carefully to what President Bush and Vice President Cheney had to say and I didn't believe them.
0.0	0.485403874517	There has to be real tax reform, and the wealthiest and large corporations will pay when I'm president.
0.0	0.460223794082	And that is what's so critical for our neighborhoods, our families, our children, and our grandchildren.
0.0	0.419750176727	I am advocating...
0.0	0.526597510833	...
0.0	0.460113957103	So let's start -- let's start with immigration.
0.0	0.421488290031	Yeah, they are unhinged.
0.0	0.493251604769	I have said that we could leave it to the states but I've also introduced a federal solution as well.
0.0	0.5	Now, as far as the renewable fuel standard is concerned, certain promises were made, certain government contracts were issued which extend all the way into the year 2022, and I believe that it's probably unfair to withdraw the rug because people have invested money.
0.0	0.422207733101	We know about the Belgians.
0.0	0.438877874032	And this summer, we didn't do that.
0.0	0.435125091715	It was a hard choice.
0.0	0.5	If the proponents of this bill actually demonstrate a commitment not to politics, not to campaigning all the time, but to actually fixing this problem, to finding a middle ground.
0.0	0.493501192006	But unlike either of these two fine people, I've actually balanced a budget every single year.
0.0	0.367318368506	That's a blessing.
0.0	0.455048331301	So David, the conclusion of all of those things is this; they weren't hopes, they weren't dreams, they weren't amorphous goals out there.
0.0	0.491875664639	And in the Holy Land Foundation trial in 2006 in Texas, they had a memorandum, an explanatory memorandum that talked about the fact that Americans would be easy to overcome and to commit civilization jihad because they were going to be trying to protect the rights of the very people who were trying to subvert them.
0.0	0.42387327435	I don't have a super PAC.
0.0	0.446678708385	We have -- I don't know that there's any disagreement here...
0.0	0.412920053069	And God bless America.
0.0	0.453592363948	Quite likely, for that reason.
0.0	0.464194055262	I would take the fight to these guys, whatever it took, as long as it took.
0.0	0.453926663169	But I think they will see a very good option here.
0.0	0.429959407494	They didn't do that either.
0.0	0.456969273081	Well, it's an interesting question because I'm very proud of my company.
0.0	0.47608743283	... wants to face Donald Trump in the general election.
0.0	0.460454463429	We bailed out Wall Street.
0.0	0.442304546804	... who got us out of that...
0.0	0.453552013785	You've got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.483145152675	Is creating much deeper, closer relations and, yes, coalitions within our own country.
0.0	0.459033696284	Now I want to go back something.
0.0	0.488155035129	And I'll tell you who supported my amendment -- Jeff Sessions, the strongest opponent of amnesty in the United States Congress.
0.0	0.5	I started as a secretary and became ultimately the chief executive of the largest technology company in the world, almost $90 billion in over 150 countries.
0.0	0.480191780376	Let's take the money that we would give to Planned Parenthood and put it in women's health care without having to harvest the organs of the unborn.
0.0	0.418456283923	But they're not good.
0.0	0.48290919283	But getting back to Martha's question about how we end dependency, do we have to have a cultural change?
0.0	0.47195131409	And I'm so grateful for the diligence, for the seriousness with which the men and women of Iowa approach this process.
0.0	0.440490156988	I made it when I ran in 2008.
0.0	0.436252979448	The worker's out of a job.
0.0	0.479688629473	Number one, we're going to keep ISIS out of America.
1.0	0.493663251757	Yesterday, it came out that costs are going for people up 29, 39, 49, and even 55 percent, and deductibles are through the roof.
0.0	0.442865369308	Your name wasn't mentioned, Ted.
0.0	0.467277433026	That has to be enforced absolutely with consequences for Iran at the slightest deviation from their requirements under the agreement.
0.0	0.477232614743	This nation has been great to me, and that's the only way I know to pay you back.
0.0	0.526597510833	She did.
0.0	0.484022176549	And make sure you enhance savings in the private market.
0.0	0.48695579935	The Democrats' answer to everything is more government control over wages, and more empowering trial lawyers to file lawsuits.

0.0	0.467886583007	We are a better country than this.

0.0	0.487118073942	A no-fly zone would prevent the outflow of refugees and give us a chance to have some safe spaces.
0.0	0.48352432176	Because this president has consistently underestimated the threat of ISIS.
0.0	0.484928739873	I have seen him appoint people to our courts not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.

0.0	0.430071711602	It is not because of the tax writeoff.
0.0	0.402957251336	It's not that hard.
0.0	0.489261687246	Our economy -- people are working harder and being left behind.
0.0	0.421461485094	Sure.
0.0	0.42954833229	That's all I'm saying.
0.0	0.478654146562	It's very important we focus on the threats we face today, and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in.
0.0	0.492869565375	Look, I don't believe there's the model -- there's lots of good people that work in finance, Secretary Sanders, but Secretary Clinton, we need to step up and we need to protect Main Street from Wall Street and you can't do that by -- by campaigning as the candidate of Wall Street.
0.0	0.394243677799	I have formed them.
0.0	0.474260930056	And this big powerful, corrupt bureaucracy works now only for the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected.
0.0	0.484326424355	It's saved a lot of lives along the way, Senator.
0.0	0.488438574162	Friends of mine are ordering Kamatsu (ph) tractors now because they've de-valued the yen to such an extent that you can't buy a Caterpillar tractor.

0.0	0.462114616078	I believe if the amendments I introduced were adopted, that the bill would pass.
0.0	0.466524611195	Our country doesn't win anymore.
0.0	0.480611519992	Under each of those three parts of my plan, I have very specific recommendations about what to do.
0.0	0.5	And clearly, what we need to do is get a group of experts together, including people from other countries, some of our friends from Israel, who have had experience screening these people and come up with new guidelines for immigration, and for visas, for people who are coming into this country.
0.0	0.486986116302	And in 19 -- and I will tell you this, and I said it very strongly, years ago, I said -- and I love the military, and I want to have the strongest military that we've ever had, and we need it more now than ever.

0.0	0.457327930156	Well, I'm very happy to get a question this early on.
1.0	0.583606705176	It enabled him -- the president to certify them en masse without mandating meaningful background checks.
0.0	0.487031501842	And those countries who are opposed to Islam, they are going to have to get deeply involved in a way that is not the case today.
0.0	0.481915549952	But it is not the world -- the role of traveling the world looking for new monsters to destroy.
0.0	0.3894976509	Thank you Chris...
0.0	0.479317756988	But I would say that if you want to defend the country, it begins with border security.
0.0	0.420429234011	They're very concerned about it.
0.0	0.492448448142	Well, for a start, this may seem like a radical idea, but I think we have got to tell the medical profession and doctors who are prescribing opiates and the pharmaceutical industry that they have got to start getting their act together, we cannot have this huge number of opiates out there throughout this country, where young people are taking them, getting hooked, and then going to heroin.
0.0	0.456395505635	No, because if you look at the quote, and it's very specific.
0.0	0.456786483706	Get rid of the fraud.
0.0	0.427468777651	No, I don't think so.
0.0	0.481527528677	The truth is it is relatively easy for a powerful nation like America to overthrow a dictator but it is very hard to predict the unintended consequences and the turmoil and the instability that follows after you overthrow that dictator.
0.0	0.463949249345	We did as much as we could because the Libyans themselves had very strong feelings about what they wished to accept.
0.0	0.472847529103	But many, many people did.
0.0	0.433433432386	I totally get that.
0.0	0.464181486981	I want to ask you: Are you fed up with how Washington taxes you?
0.0	0.48703837584	Well first of all, the idea that somehow we're better off today than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated president of the United States is totally an alternative universe.
0.0	0.418385943489	But he wasn't a cheerleader.
0.0	0.467655560489	Leading by fixing the things that are broken.
0.0	0.475015314783	And I'll add in the third, we had a great financial statement.
0.0	0.491443332839	When you ran in 2000, you said that we needed federal robust regulations.
1.0	0.5	But just think about this-- since we last debated in Las Vegas, nearly 3,000 people have been killed by guns.
0.0	0.484325419653	Let me tell you what I would do immediately, day two in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.372039130143	...John...
0.0	0.526597510833	...
0.0	0.476666361788	And most heads of businesses -- large, medium and small -- understand that.
0.0	0.476420817069	Chris, let's begin by being clear what this campaign is about.
0.0	0.452849726977	They don't provide any abortions in Louisiana.
0.0	0.488694657643	We can in fact create jobs and provide job security.
0.0	0.494723443448	We invested more in our infrastructure and we squared our shoulders to the great business opportunity of this era and that is moving our economy to a 100 percent clean electric energy future.
0.0	0.423013213567	When I was 21, my mom died.
0.0	0.485658736841	China, you go there now, roads, bridges, schools, you never saw anything like it.
0.0	0.488250259783	And the reason is, is that I've been a reformer all of my career, fighting to reform welfare, fighting to reform the Pentagon, also being in a position to balance the budget, because that is very, very hard to do.
0.0	0.474960839551	But I have never supported cap- and-trade and I never thought it was a good idea.
0.0	0.454006467929	He hit oil.
0.0	0.404691189003	Do we have answer for that?
0.0	0.47664997094	We've worked hard our whole life to provide a better family -- a better life for our family.
0.0	0.455111944749	And that's why Ronald Reagan said that it was a blindfold.
0.0	0.461628232696	But actually I am.
0.0	0.403268913856	That's fine.
0.0	0.46337445885	Oh, well, you know, it just didn't work out for you.
0.0	0.490232013873	...The other thing I'd like to make about our plan, one more point, it is the most pro growth tax plan that I can imagine because it doesn't tax investments at all.
0.0	0.481289874696	They don't want to raise the minimum wage, they don't want to do anything to increase incomes.
0.0	0.482674432933	In our own city, I mentioned before, we had become the most addicted city in America.
0.0	0.436726057445	We were attacked from Afghanistan.
0.0	0.463904696761	And I will always allow my faith to influence everything I do.
0.0	0.461216694743	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.492718636913	The reason that I -- I hate them so much is because every single regulation costs in terms of goods and services.
0.0	0.484449848996	You know, some of these -- these engagement rules that the administration has -- "we're not going to bomb a tanker that's coming out of there because there might be a person in it" -- give me a break.
0.0	0.403940748136	... on Larry Tribe.
0.0	0.526597510833	But what...
0.0	0.470935260449	... and say there is something more important than money.
0.0	0.493543111757	And if that means taking on Wall Street, I have a plan that is tough and comprehensive and praised by a lot of folks who say it goes further than what both Senator Sanders and Governor O'Malley are proposing.
0.0	0.45143131307	I have a bill to fix Medicare.
0.0	0.464732783059	So, I've laid out a five-point plan about what we can do together.
0.0	0.477364739115	And I will say this, this is going to be an election, in my opinion, that's based on competence.
0.0	0.462773119378	That is the clear and present danger.
0.0	0.410750964782	Please go to berniesanders.com.
0.0	0.46897942715	I'm not going to have something that Ted described in his tax plan.
0.0	0.477727646581	There was nobody to talk to and it really did give me an insight into the very difficult problems presidents face.
1.0	0.464780737146	It's never below zero.
0.0	0.366186531618	Maria...
0.0	0.429898753981	That's right.
0.0	0.321389529923	Thank you.
0.0	0.459915060111	He views himself not simply as the leader of Iran, but as the leader of all Muslims -- all Shia Muslims on the planet.
0.0	0.490436795307	We can reform those entitlements, we can change that corporate tax code and lower it.
0.0	0.442753322401	I came to Washington, D.C. in 1990.
0.0	0.454997215555	What is the best way to do it?
0.0	0.471396358239	Now, secondly, let me say I'm a maniac and everyone on this stage is stupid, fat, and ugly.
0.0	0.489686659219	And the people who are often the most hard-hit are widows, because when their spouse dies, they can lose up to one-half of their Social Security monthly payment.
0.0	0.471732420459	The simple fact is, we all have a record.
0.0	0.487137609351	But if we elect the right person -- if you elect me -- we will turn this country around, we will reclaim the American dream and this nation will be stronger and greater than it has ever been.
0.0	0.5	If my memory is correct, I think when we saw children coming from these horrendous, horrendously violent areas of Honduras and neighboring countries, people who are fleeing drug violence and cartel violence, I thought it was a good idea to allow those children to stay in this country.
0.0	0.459129301265	But then his poll numbers tanked.
0.0	0.46140979056	Martha, may I -- Martha, may I...
0.0	0.393811832303	Alright.
0.0	0.434086053737	And who's compromised and who is principled.
0.0	0.460040393374	I...
0.0	0.473492646477	Over time, we're going to become energy independent.
0.0	0.48551662293	So if you're having Medicare for all, single-payer, you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing.
0.0	0.469516999894	We need to invest more in terms of the other sort of visas and the other sort of waivers.
0.0	0.49303044102	And when you led the charge with the Gang of Eight, I supported it because you asked me to.
0.0	0.5	I've supported a variety of solutions, both state as well as federal.
0.0	0.428209383443	I looked at the evidence.
0.0	0.43407227982	He didn't know.
0.0	0.462448500862	It's never been that way in American politics before.
0.0	0.484677261076	ISIS, now, is the major priority.
0.0	0.449874145586	My budget was mentioned.
0.0	0.463406409619	I guess just for the fun of it; they want to throw money around.
0.0	0.473049356493	And so everybody needs to discount some of the things you're going to hear in these ads, and discount the -- the back-and-forth here, because every person here is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.460062786027	Many businessmen want to endorse me.
0.0	0.441238233562	It is a false choice.
0.0	0.476983302008	... the mandates and have a simple flat tax.
0.0	0.487037109034	How can we beat an enemy if our commander-in-chief doesn't have the moral honesty and clarity to say that Islam has a problem, and that problem is radical Islam, to say they've got to condemn not generic acts of violence, but the individual murderers who are committing these acts of violence.
0.0	0.449876986849	I'm totally open to a tariff.
0.0	0.475297398351	A debate actually is a policy issue, but I will say this.
0.0	0.424146437622	Everybody knows that.
0.0	0.462986937018	I'm using my own money.
0.0	0.481052367568	Well, I was a conservative governor of Virginia, I governed that way, and that's my track record.
0.0	0.467757959629	Because we have no protection and we have no competence, we don't know what's happening.
0.0	0.465424032157	Once again, I am running a campaign differently than any other candidate.
0.0	0.458441640209	They would never be hired again.
0.0	0.47783554081	I think if you do not understand that our Judeo-Christian values are one of the reasons why America is such a special country, you don't understand our history.
0.0	0.37181154796	So we have a disagreement on this.
0.0	0.459484909876	And frankly, if you want to be commander in chief, you have to have the experience.
0.0	0.468486480112	We need to make sure that we keep the country safe.
0.0	0.479535087862	I think there's a sense in this country today that somehow our best days are behind us.
0.0	0.487487434174	You know, Obama has presented the American people with a false choice every time.
0.0	0.492796316206	I would hope that, given the extraordinary capacities that the tech community has and the legitimate needs and questions from law enforcement, that there could be a Manhattan-like project, something that would bring the government and the tech communities together to see they're not adversaries, they've got to be partners.
0.0	0.468009160585	And Abdullah said something recently, very important.
0.0	0.470651568506	The officer who told the victims of the San Bernardino killings that he would take a bullet before them.
0.0	0.464307899613	So there are people watching tonight in business.
0.0	0.44472725898	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.46053855308	None of that information was looked at.
1.0	0.603302901658	And yet they are seeing almost all new income and all new wealth going to the top 1 percent.
0.0	0.492554219403	I believe that our Federal Government needs to do more on pell grants.
0.0	0.5	When millions of Americans rose up against amnesty, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.415176985124	They're not so stupid.
0.0	0.467371405668	And for the life of me, I have no understanding why the president thinks that everything is going well.
0.0	0.487637255858	But I do hope that in years to come, just as occurred with Cuba, 10, 20 years ago, people would say, reach normalized relations with Cuba.
0.0	0.452759153798	CRUZL But I will say --
0.0	0.43777935173	He's an S corporation.
1.0	0.575156223772	Mossadegh back in 1953.
0.0	0.442959036447	There are politics in the boardroom as well.
0.0	0.490292782854	In fact, in the last debate, very shamefully, she tried to hide her cozy relationship with Wall Street big banks by invoking the attacks of 9/11.
0.0	0.475046266669	Nothing has to change for current beneficiaries.
0.0	0.447754509201	You know, I like Marco.
0.0	0.451330325205	Can I -- can I -- I just...
0.0	0.5	And I would note the Senate just a few weeks ago voted to suspend refugees from Middle Eastern countries.
0.0	0.48576899629	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.485959982517	Not all of his top national security advisors agreed with that.
0.0	0.447098745595	She wants to pursue the American dream.
0.0	0.477691082754	That's absurd, and I think people who don't want to fix it, really, or unwilling to take the chance to say, "something has to change," are missing the boat here.
0.0	0.460365152597	One thing I want to be clear about tonight.
0.0	0.479509836404	Major crisis and primary health care.
0.0	0.470165231879	So protect the Second Amendment.
1.0	0.597166458586	I think it's fair to say, Assad has killed, by last count, about 250,000 Syrians.
0.0	0.490159242759	Mine is unique in the sense that my tax plan actually gets rid of the payroll tax as well.
0.0	0.443238145211	Well, sure.
0.0	0.465581723432	A friend of mine is a great manufacturer.
0.0	0.455157296337	And, for those of us who are serious enough to run for president, think long and hard why we're here, and hopefully you'll know we're not here for ourselves.
0.0	0.45763920017	You can change your mind.
0.0	0.481422476757	So what I had to do then is go back and start working on a bill that wasn't the bill that I wanted.
0.0	0.474706746298	We've got to build a coalition abroad.
0.0	0.435867527823	We need that thinking.
0.0	0.5	Yes, does Wall Street and big financial interests, along with drug companies, insurance companies, big oil, all of it, have too much influence?
0.0	0.460329221643	Libya is now a mess.
0.0	0.467739498871	You are working at McDonald's?
0.0	0.469776212764	But Saudi Arabia is in big, big trouble.
0.0	0.476869828201	You know, after 9/11, one of the efforts that we did in New York was if you see something or hear something suspicious, report it.
0.0	0.475913173471	If we don't stop them over there, they are coming here just as sure as I stand here in front of you.
0.0	0.452067090495	And, that's why tonight I'm asking you for your vote.
0.0	0.491053967328	I am all in favor of keeping these talented people here so they can go to work in Silicon Valley.
1.0	0.5	But two of our counties actually went to $12.80 and their county executives, if they were here tonight, would also tell you that it works.
0.0	0.484301087278	But, the real issue, I think, that the Senator is injecting into this is that if you had a Super PAC, like President Obama has, which now says it wants to support me.
0.0	0.482020102858	We don't want to make it seem as though we are turning into a nation of fear instead of a nation of resolve.
0.0	0.465879895666	They're devaluing their currency and they're killing our companies.
1.0	0.5	We have 400,000 small businesses forming every year in this country.
0.0	0.475006580614	It's not just about getting rid of a single dictator.
0.0	0.5	I have a strategy to combat and defeat ISIS without getting us involved in another ground war, and I have plans to raise incomes and deal with a lot of the problems that keep families up at night.
0.0	0.42498203717	We can do that in Washington.
0.0	0.441265481473	And I'm not blaming these folks -- but I guess I could.
0.0	0.441644051734	But I guess I'm supposed to come out great.
0.0	0.459770212866	Here's the bottom line, and I'll close with this.
0.0	0.462205744389	I can agree with you or not, but you can't have a question over your head.
0.0	0.431812054871	We're running.
0.0	0.483073031031	Women are not charged more than men any longer for our health insurance.
0.0	0.526597510833	No.
0.0	0.469193984827	And now mom and dad can stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.
0.0	0.393273670025	Neil?
0.0	0.480113673784	We need to have a resolve that will bring the world together to root out the kind of radical jihadist ideology that motivates organizations like ISIS, a barbaric, ruthless, violent jihadist terrorist group.
0.0	0.492180105854	In fact, just last week, I introduced the Life at Conception act, which would say that the 14th amendment would defend an individual even in the womb.
0.0	0.460057791057	We are doing both at the same time.
0.0	0.447744524974	We have people that don't have it.
0.0	0.467652581101	We need sound money.

1.0	0.580583432678	It was an effort led by several people that provided almost an instant path with very little obstacles moving forward.
0.0	0.491127176229	And I'm the only candidate on this stage to put forward a new agenda for America's cities so we can employ more people in the heart of great American cities and get them back to work.

0.0	0.526597510833	What are we doing?
0.0	0.468514179532	That is what is going to have to happen, if we want to revitalize and rebuild the crumbling middle class.
0.0	0.466939315744	When you head back to airport tonight, go check and see what the...
0.0	0.481339761042	But when you didn't do that and you ask people to support, you shouldn't cut and run.

0.0	0.473092157389	We're going dark when it comes to detecting the next attack.
0.0	0.469263001082	That's the kind of coalition we need and that's the kind of coalition I will put together.
0.0	0.44166669312	I looked into the eyes of Boy Scouts.

0.0	0.470895801191	And it has three parts.
0.0	0.470973207343	We will renew America if we work together, and I am totally confident that we will.
0.0	0.389975372381	For her convenience.
0.0	0.489588830997	They want American soldiers on the ground fighting them, giving them many more targets, and giving them a great recruiting opportunity.
0.0	0.464882612247	I guess I'm part of the establishment Barbara Bush is my mom.
0.0	0.487449553823	To repeal these unconstitutional illegal orders, whether it's amnesty or whether it's this president going around the Congress, whether it's in Obamacare, to restore the rule of law.
0.0	0.473188761249	And if this humanitarian crisis increases, we should accept more.
0.0	0.484033511086	That's what I said to my own public health people.
0.0	0.439228814377	I agree with my colleagues.
1.0	0.5	That billionaires pay an effective tax rate lower than nurses or truck drivers.
1.0	0.464230026638	And he says, the president's appointee, that crime is going up because of this.
0.0	0.428003795296	And, we said no.
0.0	0.5	You know that the United States per capita pays far and away more than other country.
0.0	0.477338705787	Abroad, we need a coalition that is going to take on ISIS.
0.0	0.5	The entire system of legal immigration must now be reexamined for security first and foremost, with an eye on ISIS.

0.0	0.443153267308	Neil, I was mentioned too.
0.0	0.466787042797	I don't think anybody should expand Medicaid.
0.0	0.483387680949	And the thing is, she can't be a champion of women's rights at the same time she's got this that is always lurking out there, this type of behavior.
0.0	0.486625614639	You can't get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year.
0.0	0.492928752077	Yes, I believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on Wall Street, that they are a Wall Street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession -- Great Depression.
0.0	0.442867419349	Again, with all do respect to Secretary Clinton...
0.0	0.479814860775	We have not made the investments that we need to make to understand and to have relationships with future leaders that are coming up.
0.0	0.468694380061	Everybody thought the deal was dead.
0.0	0.429898753981	That's right.
0.0	0.478831735735	People came back from Iraq and Afghanistan without legs, without arms.
1.0	0.478910783843	And some of them are like third world countries.
0.0	0.492002898457	The reality is four times as many blacks get arrested for marijuana.
0.0	0.468999497231	My wife, Jane, has been -- way back when before I knew her, a foster parent.
0.0	0.321389529923	Thank you.
0.0	0.386708999059	It's Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.47077751034	We are already de-conflicting air space.
0.0	0.484599572848	We got into a bad habit of creating big bureaucracies, old methodologies, to undermine regimes that were not friendly to the United States.
1.0	0.459328587075	I never filed for bankruptcy.
0.0	0.475749988159	As far as Mark is concerned, as far as the visas are concerned, if we need people, they have -- it's fine.
0.0	0.477854668475	I think our country is tired of the politicians who simply read the polls and fail to lead.
0.0	0.379352476276	That is not what America should be about.
1.0	0.572113059772	In the past he has called him weak.
0.0	0.433542921916	I don't have to, believe it or not.
0.0	0.479784112551	And then we need to shut down -- we need to shut down their mechanisms of funding and attack their command-and-control centers.
0.0	0.463153958015	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.48866342434	Now, our country could never do that because we'd have to get environmental clearance, and the environmentalist wouldn't let our country -- we would never build in an ocean.
0.0	0.467000829282	They will never make America great again.
0.0	0.473857899316	We need to do it now as a nation.
0.0	0.439745894732	We saw that in Egypt.
0.0	0.491186003415	With respect to the United States, I think our role in NATO, our support for the E.U., as well as our willingness to take refugees so long as they are thoroughly vetted and that we have confidence from intelligence and other sources that they can come to our country, we should be doing our part.
0.0	0.455000723615	If I'm president, there won't be stupid deals anymore.
0.0	0.455410667902	Now Maria, listen.
0.0	0.489181641389	If you believe that our country's problems and the threats that we face in this world can only be met with new thinking, new and fresh approaches, then I ask you to join my campaign.
0.0	0.441071111054	My name was invoked.
0.0	0.469095021556	And in your heart of hearts, you cannot wait to see a debate between Hillary Clinton and Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.484263400073	And my effort in introducing them was to find a solution that reflected common ground and that fixed the problem.
0.0	0.463984827165	And by the way, I'm not even saying that in a -- that's the kind of mindset, that's the kind of thinking you need for this country.
0.0	0.472553785189	We took it away from the NSA, it was a bad decision by the president.
0.0	0.484751600473	Yes, we could get rid of Assad tomorrow, but that would create another political vacuum that would benefit ISIS.
0.0	0.473038011607	There are a lot of things we've got to do in our country, reigning in Wall Street is certainly one of them.
0.0	0.420978161633	Here's what I believe.
1.0	0.483611589916	The Republicans have voted to repeal it nearly 60 times.
0.0	0.469706172495	What we need to do is destroy their ability to attack us here over there, and then get out.
0.0	0.490413865609	We've cut 26 percent of our budget.
0.0	0.483573060185	One, work with the tough men, the dictators, for our own benefit and promote democracy.
0.0	0.494132510824	It's no longer enough just to say the vast majority of Americans want common sense gun safety measures including gun owners.
0.0	0.464688580205	I didn't know I had so much power.
0.0	0.464254810834	We need to deal with ISIS in the caliphate.
0.0	0.493502375835	And our focus has got to be on intelligence, increased manpower, fighting internationally targets.
0.0	0.5	...One more time, in Ohio, our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.481482896667	I've learned from him that what we need to achieve is peace through strength, which means we need to rebuild the military.
0.0	0.446080188571	Well, a couple of things.
0.0	0.5	(BELL RINGS) ... and there's a reason, when Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer came after our right to keep and bear arms, that I led the opposition, along with millions of Americans -- we defeated that gun control legislation.
0.0	0.439554318376	And that was the state of Texas.
0.0	0.466021645905	I believe that we need to focus on destroying ISIL.
0.0	0.4764142419	That's what they do, whether it's the San Bernardino attack or if it's these tragedies that take place, I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is.
0.0	0.474061420294	Senator Cruz is precisely right.
0.0	0.468709214176	Well, he appointed Eric Holder as attorney general.
0.0	0.458735830394	It will be fly-to country.
0.0	0.5	But in the interim, in the absence of that, what's happening is some of these tech companies are taking those -- those centers (ph) to Canada because they can get people to go over there instead of here.
0.0	0.462078279044	But the facts and the law here are really quite clear.
0.0	0.457094904029	I have a comprehensive, tough plan.
0.0	0.447876701159	They're not my ideas, and I don't necessarily agree with all of them.
0.0	0.465729128364	Yes, of course Assad is a terrible dictator.
0.0	0.478350482441	Just like Martin, I met with a group of Muslim-Americans this past week to hear from them about what they're doing to try to stop radicalization.
0.0	0.482501323209	In my own state, for example, we launched an investigation, asked the FBI to cooperate.
0.0	0.430290567811	No, it's your record.
0.0	0.5	At the center of my economic policy is raising incomes, because people haven't been able to get ahead, and the cost of everything, from college tuition to prescription drugs, has gone up.
0.0	0.461594939313	So, I mean this may seem like a bit of an arcane discussion.
0.0	0.488094097702	So whoever is part of the family of a president has an extraordinary privilege of not only having a front row seat on history but making her or maybe his contribution.
0.0	0.410418759562	Well, thank you.
0.0	0.472433985943	So why are the pharmaceutical companies consolidating?
0.0	0.431453033739	..."diabetes, heart disease, cancer and Alzheimer's?"
0.0	0.446121472989	Just can't happen.
0.0	0.457283978665	Two points.
0.0	0.437766912713	... hillaryclinton.com, and read about it.
0.0	0.475089923087	I'm very much against the government being involved in every aspect of our lives, you know?
0.0	0.458559548746	I'm glad that late last night, that was resolved.
0.0	0.5	I cut the bureaucracy down to size, re-introduced accountability, focused on service, on innovation, on leading in every market, in every product segment.
0.0	0.424936271317	You can do both.
0.0	0.48156714219	But where we have a disagreement is that I think if you look at the history of regime changes, you go back to Mossaddegh (ph) in Iran, you go back to Salvador Allende who we overthrew in Chile, you go back to overthrowing Saddam Hussein in Iraq, you go back to where we are today in Syria with a dictator named Assad.
0.0	0.488096276283	Look, we are fighting for every vote that we can get from women, from men, straight, gay, African-Americans, Latinos, Asian-Americans.
0.0	0.5	Well, I don't agree with that, because we will not get the support on the ground in Syria to dislodge ISIS if the fighters there who are not associated with ISIS, but whose principal goal is getting rid of Assad, don't believe there is a political, diplomatic channel that is ongoing.
1.0	0.581244805059	But I want to -- I want to follow up on something having to do with leadership, because, you know, today Senator Sanders said that President Obama failed the presidential leadership test.
0.0	0.427468777651	I think if it doesn't...
0.0	0.493939117604	Look, in addition to what Donald was saying is we also need to talk about the legal immigration system for permanent residents.
0.0	0.45802558254	I couldn't have said it better myself.
0.0	0.46895149044	I support NAFTA.
0.0	0.455852183612	You've got to have a clear vision of where you want to go.
0.0	0.488223064639	To use the Justice Department, as we just saw, they have said they are going to sue Ferguson, that entered into a consent agreement, and then tried to back out.
1.0	0.597328406366	I can tell you that adding up the fact you're not paying any private insurance, businesses are not paying any private insurance.
0.0	0.466770737608	We need new leadership.
0.0	0.477249577066	And not only did I fight them and win, I lived to tell about it and I'm standing on this stage tonight as evidence of that.
0.0	0.471556388008	Support community banks and credit unions.
0.0	0.447161358618	Let me be clear.
0.0	0.490666123297	I don't agree that we're going to occupy and spend another decade or a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.456117034191	I was down there, and I've never seen anything like it.
0.0	0.489598312547	And, you know, there are a number of programs that I think are duplicative and redundant and not producing the results that people deserve.
0.0	0.423955418781	No, I think they won't.
0.0	0.474852154598	But if that's the best the New York Times has got, they better go back to the well.
0.0	0.479018189457	The administration originally said 10.
0.0	0.468033172798	When you come back to me, I'll share that story.
0.0	0.46271247483	The only way we're going to solve this problem is with we, the people.
0.0	0.479952382762	Judy, one area very briefly...
0.0	0.5	When you have three out of the four largest financial institutions in this country bigger today than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have six financial institutions having assets equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of America, while issuing two-thirds of the credit cards and a third of the mortgages, look, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, that great trust-buster would have said break them up.
0.0	0.478437853824	And we rebuilt downtown Manhattan, and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved New York and loved New Yorkers.
0.0	0.484958241893	We have to offer a compelling alternative that is based on hope and optimism and grounded in serious policy, which I've laid out.
0.0	0.483301258695	We have got to make sure that local police departments look like the communities they serve in their diversity.
0.0	0.456057954485	You know, we had this incident before, Secretary, with your famous e-mails.
0.0	0.461757881657	You've got to give people hope.
0.0	0.452063696484	We need a collaborative approach.
0.0	0.467837305886	You don't have to guess about it, because I actually have a record.
0.0	0.477939239893	And -- you know, all of this too big to fail stuff and picking and choosing winners and losers -- this is a bunch of crap, and it is really causing a great deal of -- great deal of problems for our society right now.
0.0	0.5	The main problem with Medicare right now is that the average person pays in taxes over their whole lifetime about $100,000.
0.0	0.486856972266	And, yes, people we may disagree with on a number of things may have some insight, may have some relationships that are important for the president to understand in order to best protect the United States.
0.0	0.481083006874	And, you know, I do think it's important to do exactly what Senator Sanders said, and that is to start talking about the issues that the American people really care about, and that they talk to each of us about.
0.0	0.403268913856	That's fine.
0.0	0.490932075011	This is a group of people that burns people in cages, that is conducting genocide against Christians and Yazidis and others in the region.
0.0	0.407312550138	I was recruited to H.P.
0.0	0.465448227672	I don't think anyone has a magical solution.
0.0	0.428588172628	That's the good news.
0.0	0.5	And in fact, Kissinger's actions in Cambodia, when the United States bombed that country, overthrew Prince Sihanouk, created the instability for Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge to come in, who then butchered some 3 million innocent people, one of the worst genocides in the history of the world.
0.0	0.427341423706	And you can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.488841273861	But the first task is to bring countries together to destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.473703573287	I said, absolutely, you can still change the world.
0.0	0.48991308159	Not only were we the first state in the nation to pass a living wage.
0.0	0.5	Today, we are on pace to have the smallest Army since the end of World War II, the smallest Navy in 100 years, the smallest Air Force in our history.
0.0	0.463087325495	And I agree with much of what the secretary and the governor have said.
0.0	0.473637926898	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.472075827261	I ask for your support on the caucuses come Monday night and I will make you proud as our party's nominee.
0.0	0.493729308163	$1 billion a day.

0.0	0.5	You know, it's -- it's a fact that if you can pay for a $79 one-way ticket to Orlando, and you can escape the challenges of a declining economy and high crime rates, you move to Orlando.
0.0	0.446264181026	I want to be in -- I want America to be the best...
0.0	0.483613958028	If I become President because we'll have a Constitutional Amendment to require a federally balanced budget so they will do their job.
0.0	0.450569788228	I'm asking you for your vote.
0.0	0.494017174202	Every (inaudible) Democrat and senator in support of this proposal introduced by your good friend and my good friend, Kirsten Gillibrand, Rosa DeLauro, got ears (ph) to legislation out there that will finally provide family and medical leave.
0.0	0.429898753981	That's right.
0.0	0.413958334643	Not good.
0.0	0.424839533587	It's not about Donald Trump.
1.0	0.605370225929	Senator Sanders voted against the Brady Bill.
0.0	0.458762032377	Everybody thought it was a done deal.
0.0	0.480765118572	But realistically, even if they do, the money is flowing.
0.0	0.399943573187	She's not the threat.
0.0	0.483367460262	And, that will get to the nub of opportunity for our children, and an ability to see wages rise.
0.0	0.526597510833	I was not at all.
0.0	0.44951518728	Well, I -- if I might.
0.0	0.48759931494	We have people that are selling this country down the drain.
0.0	0.386124609134	We can't do it.
0.0	0.456509963845	I'm going to support you, and I think that is absolutely appropriate.
0.0	0.494045457699	But what is to prevent a future liberal president or a liberal Congress from coming back and not just raising the income tax, but also raising that VAT tax, and that vat tax is really bad for seniors.
0.0	0.45276296475	When do we beat Mexico at the border?
0.0	0.462719786935	s entrenched problems head-on.
0.0	0.464870381463	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.481838263261	And, you know, with all due respect, Senator, you voted for regime change with respect to Libya.
0.0	0.436337626791	And that's really a theme of a lot of the things that I'm talking about.
0.0	0.474237131018	I know a lot of Americans are angry about the economy.
0.0	0.492652410851	Second of all what we do, is you raise the minimum wage to living wage, 15 bucks an hour over the next several years.
1.0	0.5	Not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama and the big government economy, the median wage for women has dropped $733.
0.0	0.447481724671	I like Marco Rubio.
0.0	0.489119294952	You're going to get it by paying your employees less and charging your customers more, that is a tax, the difference is, you don't see it on the bill.
0.0	0.462845104401	Listen, we -- this is the greatest country in the history of mankind.
0.0	0.485591222497	We need a leader that can bring back our jobs, can bring back our manufacturing, can bring back our military, can take care of our vets.
0.0	0.5	To the 1 percent who have been fighting this war for over a decade, I'd try my best to be a commander-in-chief worthy of your sacrifice.
0.0	0.471551952632	It would not necessitate us raising any taxes.
0.0	0.454995292146	There must be some way.
0.0	0.462072697452	That's not even an issue.
0.0	0.466051114971	Crony capitalism is alive and well, and has been so in Washington, D.C. for decades.
0.0	0.465837643783	Great state, great people.
0.0	0.451396853189	We'll just clean it up.
0.0	0.49388968236	I want to end the international embarrassment of the United States of America being the only major country on earth that doesn't guarantee health care to all people as a right, not a privilege.
0.0	0.450470670235	They wanted Boeing's secrets.
0.0	0.488341483051	Because we have found a way to reduce hospital costs, so whenever we come...
0.0	0.448642063393	I waited and I got the scars to show for it.
0.0	0.468088955826	You know, all of these politicians that I'm running against now -- it's so nice to say I'm running as opposed to if I run, if I run.
0.0	0.466766289711	To talk about we're just gonna have a 10 percent tithe and that's how we're gonna fund the government?
0.0	0.473942627096	And I'll tell you what Hillary Clinton has said: Hillary Clinton says she agrees with the dissenters -- the Supreme Court dissenters in the Heller case.
0.0	0.421253817521	Bipartisan issue.
0.0	0.466961687354	And, this is what I am finding throughout America.
0.0	0.5	Well, first of all, under President Jeb Bush, we would restore the strength of the military.
0.0	0.475891812682	And I also know that -- and I'm glad to see this -- Senator Sanders has really moved in face of the facts about what we're confronting in our country.
0.0	0.4100963704	Bigger than that?
0.0	0.455706127867	He has got -- that is why he is on the end.
0.0	0.5	Bottom line is a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people, if Congress doesn't do the right thing, we use the executive orders of the president.
0.0	0.449861731439	They're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.452856767361	I know the good ones.
0.0	0.485951252571	And remember this, after Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have had nearly 8 years, we have fewer democracies in the world than we had when they started.
0.0	0.405171745201	It is a step forward.
0.0	0.473979342606	Anyone can go online at tedcruz.org and read exactly what it said.
0.0	0.5	But I will tell you this, Atlantic City, you're using that, hundreds of companies that I have opened have thrived.
0.0	0.493305820457	That is the way we deal with global warming, climate change, or any of those problems, not through government intervention, not through government taxes, and for God's sake, don't send Washington another dime until they stop wasting the money they're already sending there.
0.0	0.49358321587	And we will join the rest of the other -- the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families.
0.0	0.5	We last year there was an additional 81,000 pages of government regulations.
0.0	0.448406811893	... ground and air.
0.0	0.321389529923	Thank you.
0.0	0.5	And just like Social Security and unlike the Republicans, I think we should actually expand Social Security and increase average monthly benefits.
0.0	0.482696089189	And I'll tell you the endorsements that I am proud of are the over 200,000 volunteers across this country who have signed up to volunteer for our campaign.
0.0	0.477715960775	All I'm saying is our next president has to be someone that undoes the damage Barack Obama has done to this country.
0.0	0.421026290465	Who denies that it is crazy...
0.0	0.442317238428	I'm president -- look, I've done it once.
0.0	0.480583552827	Iran is going to take over the Middle East, Iran and somebody else will get the oil, and it turned out that Iran is now taking over Iraq.
1.0	0.5	You know, I left my medical practice and ran for office because I was concerned about an $18 trillion debt.
0.0	0.466199449007	I will be that new leader.
0.0	0.476354799383	Right and left are spending us into oblivion.
0.0	0.466725221952	... first of all, I'm -- don't worry, I'm not leaving the stage no matter what you ask me.
0.0	0.453096718691	-- the governor's absolutely right.
0.0	0.425649302147	You're right about that.
0.0	0.494048280891	This campaign is about the greatest country in the world and a president who has systematically destroyed many of the things that made America special.
0.0	0.488389764406	Now, I find it rather amazing, because I happen to believe that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country.
0.0	0.449810814639	You want to know what carpet bombing is?
0.0	0.466378671525	We've got a president who instead says, we're going to change hearts and minds.
0.0	0.449336076377	They are not going to go away on their own.
0.0	0.465059991954	I don't need anybody's money.
0.0	0.5	It will lower the cost of health care for a middle-class family by thousands of dollars a year.
0.0	0.4488799177	China and Russia have never been on our side of the table.
0.0	0.454973287905	Government is the enemy.
0.0	0.489301890832	It was LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations in this country.
0.0	0.488935692873	And that is that we have some colleges and universities that are spending a huge amount of money on fancy dormitories and on giant football stadiums.
0.0	0.398928731328	It's not responsible.
0.0	0.437801748336	QUICK: Governor, thank you.
0.0	0.474195694808	Let me tell you who's not qualified to be President of the United States, Chris.
0.0	0.480356489485	The fact is if we don't address what's costing so much, we can't throw enough money at this.
0.0	0.477078143608	... First of all -- Let me go first, and then you can please recognize Rand after.
0.0	0.487679586754	Now, I for seven years was the U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.484595547256	I know there have been people who have been fired; people who are being held accountable.
0.0	0.468334056452	And your point is absolutely well taken.
0.0	0.467609636025	If you will join me in this campaign, we will make that a mission.
0.0	0.490740705818	Barack Obama got his massive tax increase, and there was no spending cuts.
0.0	0.477236054955	And by the way, Jeb you mentioned Boeing, take a look.
0.0	0.482036636694	Let's quit blaming the people on Social Security.
0.0	0.463253283422	Look, I have said I want to be the president for the struggling, the striving and the successful.
0.0	0.435774470047	Secretary Clinton, I don't have a super PAC.
0.0	0.464553680943	They're a feeding frenzy for sick people.
0.0	0.446303398396	A terrible sight.
0.0	0.505237018847	I have never heard a candidate never, who has received huge amounts of money from oil, from coal, from Wall Street, from the military industrial complex, not one candidate say, oh, these campaign contributions will not influence me.
0.0	0.476026267356	The result of that, you had the Iranian Revolution coming in, and that is where we are today.
0.0	0.461779861599	And it's not too much to ask of our generation after everything our parents and our grandparents did for us.
0.0	0.379448634605	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
0.0	0.440750372276	They don't know what they're doing.
0.0	0.48065600315	And we are going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fall.
0.0	0.46757072194	You spend the money today and then you hope you're going to save money tomorrow.
0.0	0.472943466745	The government is not always going to save us and it's not always going to come from government.
0.0	0.472845302128	Just like getting rid of Medicare and Medicaid.
0.0	0.438463008894	And it's an honor to have everybody here.
0.0	0.486211748314	But let's be clear: Russia's aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO -- correctly, I believe -- are saying, you know what, we're going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action.
0.0	0.492355872693	You know, I recently met with a group of mothers who lost their children to either killings by police or random killings in their neighborhoods, and hearing their stories was so incredibly, profoundly heartbreaking.
0.0	0.446800868714	I suspect you may have.
0.0	0.486237197105	And the issue is, the problem is, the front pages every day were dealing with it.
0.0	0.486613121619	The question always is, what works better, the private marketplace or government?
0.0	0.488747078564	And, of course, I met the mothers of Eric Garner and Tamir Rice, and Michael Brown and Trayvon Martin and so many of them who have lost their children.
0.0	0.462984057152	I know how hard it is to build coalitions.
0.0	0.438340709794	All of these are very difficult issues.
0.0	0.453994554388	I'm not using donors.
0.0	0.485931791589	We have to be prepared to defend the American people, prepare them for a long war, stand up for the defense of this country, and stand up for the values of this country...
0.0	0.481067808532	... believe me the world is peanuts by comparison.
0.0	0.493136101867	As a member of the Health Education Committee that helped write the Affordable Care Act, much of what Secretary Clinton said about what we have done, among other things, ending the obscenity of this pre-existing situation is a step forward.
0.0	0.466760452276	This issue touches on two broad issues.
0.0	0.444944800257	Are you serious about this election?
0.0	0.494763180684	If we elect Hillary Clinton, the next four years will be worse than the last eight, and our children will be the first Americans ever to inherit a diminished country.
0.0	0.376051816492	It's nice.
0.0	0.486047165638	But you know what, you can make a middle class wage, you have decent health care, decent benefits.
0.0	0.480690780556	And you look around, and you see what's happening, and this is not the case when he introduced the doctor -- very nice, everything perfect but that is not representative of what you have in that line of migration.
0.0	0.489446669551	The reason all of us are here is we believe we should be fighting for the working men and women of this country, and not Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.5	We have seniors out there who are scared to death because this Congress -- this one that we have right now, just stole $150 billion from the Social Security retirement fund to give it to the Social Security disability fund.
0.0	0.383298241849	That's a dictatorship.
0.0	0.5	They see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on Wall Street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all.
0.0	0.476849078632	And strengthen our military and take care of our vets.
0.0	0.484654138553	And why I am a staunch supporter of President Obama's principal accomplishment -- namely the Affordable Care Act -- is because I know how hard it was to get that done.
0.0	0.429898753981	Right.
1.0	0.5	A $5 billion Web site.
0.0	0.470501953686	And Bernie Sanders will tell them that it's because of the rich.
0.0	0.451434571613	I think that would have been right, as well.
0.0	0.486925574221	We had an audit-the-Fed vote, which was the biggest thing my dad had been advocating for, for 30 years, Ted didn't have time to show up.
0.0	0.480540039929	They told you that your Social Security money is in a trust fund.
0.0	0.484540896324	I believe that it's most important that we unleash the full potential of women and girls in our society.
0.0	0.5	I voted against the war in Iraq because I thought unilateral military action would not produce the results that were necessary and would lead to the kind of unraveling and instability that we saw in the Middle East.
0.0	0.429898753981	She was right.
0.0	0.427987040094	It will not happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.491014796825	We just, earlier this week, kicked them out of Medicaid in Louisiana as well, canceled their provider contract.
0.0	0.49056323973	And I believe only with a strong America will we defeat this radical group, this apocalyptic group called ISIS.
0.0	0.419060854775	That's not true.
0.0	0.464634229552	Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point?
0.0	0.482317299613	I think it was a mistake to expand Medicaid everywhere in Ohio and across the country.
0.0	0.47237376864	And here's the problem with what's going on around the world.
0.0	0.486695455947	And specifically, we know that we could have detected and repelled some of these cyber attacks if that collaboration had been permitted.
0.0	0.455476722565	That's a hard road to walk.
0.0	0.449797179155	It will end on January 2017.
0.0	0.464489218574	One of your colleagues interviewed me.
0.0	0.482486881266	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
1.0	0.578286247463	He told the police, "I did it because I was inspired by ISIS," and to this day, the White House still refuses to acknowledge it had anything to do with terror.
0.0	0.489220705083	We now have some good models about how better to provide employment, housing and education.
0.0	0.5	We have to invest in the local partnerships, and the best place to intervene, the best indicator of when a person is actually on the verge of killing themselves because of an addiction, is at the hospital.
0.0	0.476161392239	We were proud of them on graduation day, but we're going to be proud every month for the rest of our natural lives.
0.0	0.5	And that's why I've offered a specific program to the people of America tonight to address the fundamental problem of getting our country growing again, getting our economy growing, wages up, opportunities for people.
1.0	0.362319712749	They stole it.
0.0	0.476443090171	Well, this is one of the reasons why Tom Perkins and I had disagreements in the boardroom, Becky.
0.0	0.482126036863	Not too many years ago, Donald did a long interview with Tim Russert.
0.0	0.484541611773	Now, when Secretary Clinton says, "I'm not going raise taxes on the middle class," let me tell you what she is saying.
0.0	0.481227561232	This president has gone to Congress and said give me a three-year deadline, give me a ban on ground troops.
1.0	0.460364728763	They're bringing drugs.
0.0	0.469017459595	I think we need to put in some armored brigades there.
0.0	0.526597510833	And...
0.0	0.447758244392	I said, "What's your problem?"
0.0	0.489243656908	And I will pay for it by, yes, taxing the wealthy more, closing corporate loopholes, deductions, and other kinds of favorable treatment.
0.0	0.398119948329	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.445376572559	Not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.490473070781	I don't know if any of us could have done what they did, one after another, within 48 hours of that tragedy taking place.
0.0	0.483538728521	I believe that the way forward for our country is to actually reinvigorate our antitrust department with the directive to promote fair competition.
0.0	0.490494416748	And when countries violate trade agreements or dump product in this country, we need -- we need to stand up against those countries that do that without making them into an enemy.
0.0	0.488729851713	And yes, when I am president of the United States, if there is some place in this country where radical jihadists are planning to attack the United States, we will go after them wherever they are, and if we capture them alive, they are going to Guantanamo.
0.0	0.470175707146	And this is where I've had my disagreement with Senator Rubio.
0.0	0.477368876371	Let me tell you, Donald Trump would be a president every day of the week and twice on Sunday, rather than Hillary.
0.0	0.411780109115	I have to tell you.
0.0	0.412544007453	It is a complicated relationship.
0.0	0.480937346006	And let me, by the way, take this moment to congratulate Hillary Clinton, who I thought not only did an outstanding job as our first lady, but redefined what that role could be.
0.0	0.431008814964	You're simply not.
0.0	0.481933450255	They're building up their military to a point that is very scary.
0.0	0.460012661131	Here's the thing that I would ask Donald Trump in all seriousness.
0.0	0.468098822108	We don't want to be like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.477038066078	One principle, for example, we've got to embrace is on immigration.
0.0	0.455606429882	You know, I have two sons.
0.0	0.425509596067	Good at email.
0.0	0.434896599569	She said the truth.
0.0	0.450084040705	This is a remarkable and horrifying fact.
0.0	0.469339180454	Well, I just want to quickly add...
0.0	0.47825974131	I never said that Ms. Davis should either lose her job or that she had to do it.
0.0	0.492585861517	And now after seven years of your policies, we have the biggest majority we've had since the 1920s in the House; a Republican majority in the Senate; and 31 out of 50 Republican governors.
0.0	0.452412853416	I'm looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.48139583534	But the thing that is most important to me and caused me to run for office is I'm worried about the country and how much debt we're adding.
0.0	0.491930253741	And then, with the revolution against Assad -- and I did early on say we needed to try to find a way to train and equip moderates very early so that we would have a better idea of how to deal with Assad because I thought there would be extremist groups filling the vacuum.
0.0	0.461595432503	If an American missionary has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.472578586466	Those of you health savings accounts.
0.0	0.493881813673	Well, first, Judy, I have spent my entire adult life working toward making sure that women are empowered to make their own choices, even if that choice is not to vote for me.
0.0	0.464199087668	The world has changed.
0.0	0.321389529923	Thank you.
0.0	0.483849174796	Now, they do charge you tariff on trucks, when we send trucks and other things over there.
0.0	0.470288173652	This is a business flat tax.
0.0	0.5	The simple fact is one of the ways, Maria, to solve the problem you described is narrow the number of people coming by family petitioning to what every other country has so that we have the best and the brightest that come to our country.
0.0	0.472464121721	The NSA is another big issue.
0.0	0.457742727304	Our vets may see the V.A.
0.0	0.475500514088	I will spend every ounce of energy to stop it.
0.0	0.490857842891	So what I would say is not only do we need to be thinking in military terms, but we do our military a disservice when we don't greatly dial up the investment that we are making in diplomacy and human intelligence and when we fail to dial up properly, the role of sustainable development in all of this.
0.0	0.487687983433	Planned Parenthood had better hope that Hillary Clinton wins this election, because I guarantee under President Jindal, January 2017, the Department of Justice and the IRS and everybody else that we can send from the federal government will be going in to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.472422843211	This is a guy who just believes that law enforcement are the bad guys.
0.0	0.480707243975	I also believe that marriage is between one man and one woman.
0.0	0.434422382456	The answer is simple.
0.0	0.465016302545	It's like a tariff, but here's the difference: if we impose a tariff, China responds.
0.0	0.473403470555	He thinks low wages are a good idea.
0.0	0.422301430922	Yes.
0.0	0.474656805365	I'll bring back our jobs from China, from Mexico, from Japan, from so many places.
0.0	0.488454956095	Whose fault is it that Medicare is broken, out of money, that Social Security is broken, out of money?
0.0	0.464967516007	I believe in it but we have to be smart and we have to use smart people to negotiate.
0.0	0.409578648013	They have no choice.
0.0	0.389596475886	I'm very proud.
0.0	0.422781876626	So we need 1,000.
0.0	0.461346398218	I've got a very simple strategy as your president against ISIL.
0.0	0.477965043997	We will rise to challenge of ISIL and we will rise together to the challenges that we face in our economy.
0.0	0.483515505217	And if we capture any of these ISIS killers alive, they are going to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we're going to find out everything they know, because when I'm president, unlike Barack Obama, we will keep this country safe.
0.0	0.458530975374	I don't want immigration reform to fail.
0.0	0.473590949801	And one more point, one more point.
0.0	0.455096820423	And, you know, China comes over and they dump all their stuff, and I buy it.
0.0	0.476616467496	We have to show that we can march to a balanced budget.
0.0	0.426313323918	And this is not an endeavor that rewards that.
0.0	0.473924029484	Let's go to the major issues facing America.
0.0	0.387084052754	I won't be doing that.
0.0	0.476863757717	I really put that on Assad and on the Iraqis and on the region itself.
0.0	0.440540354095	And for good cause.
0.0	0.478273597045	So, I think it's important for us to be careful about the language we use, which is why I've been critical of Donald Trump.
0.0	0.4602830494	And he said, oh, I'm never going to attack.
0.0	0.486816904491	Well, it's not a matter of what the first executive order would be, Bill.
0.0	0.450349480338	Nothing's gonna get done.
0.0	0.48454096301	You cannot make rash statements and expect the rest of the world to respond as though, well, it's just politics.
0.0	0.490124173723	Now, the fact is, what this president has done is invited Russia to play an even bigger role, bring in Vladimir Putin to negotiate getting those chemical weapons back from Assad, yet what do we have today?
0.0	0.439820981231	But Secretary Clinton is wrong.
0.0	0.482963029059	But it is absolutely fair and necessary for Americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average American family?
0.0	0.48587023702	And I propose a block grant program that will keep the states in the game as well.
0.0	0.5	Universal national service is an option for every kid in America to cut youth employment.
0.0	0.387550410317	Yeah.
0.0	0.434405970641	So under President Trump, here's what would happen:
0.0	0.474798036792	There are loads of great ideas, great conservative ideas from wonderful think tanks about how to reform the tax code.
0.0	0.47986493115	Martha, religious liberty doesn't include encouraging a fellow American to engage in violent jihad and kill an American here.
0.0	0.453424544457	There's no way he launches 11 attack --
0.0	0.477982543529	Free trade can be wonderful if you have smart people, but we have people that are stupid.
0.0	0.5	I wanna tell you, in my state, we took Medicaid, the hardest program to control, and we took it from a 10 percent growth rate to 2.5 percent without taking one person off the rolls or cutting one single benefit.
0.0	0.452270249126	We saw what happened in Egypt.
0.0	0.477593766444	I would also just say this.
0.0	0.46720651001	Barack Obama was never responsible for those decisions.
0.0	0.5	I've said I'm looking at a couple of different ways, one which you mentioned, Senator, but also trying to expand the existing tax to passive income that wealthy people have so that we do get more revenue into the Social Security Trust Fund.
0.0	0.44301474589	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.402043925645	It's the same thing that I did in Ohio.
0.0	0.490771361298	And I would hope in the midst of all of this discussion, this country makes certain that we do not turn our backs on the men and women who put their lives on the line to defend us, and that we stand with them as they have stood with us.
0.0	0.479534446018	But I will certainly turn to him as prior presidents have for special missions, for advice, and in particular, how we're going to get the economy working again for everybody, which he knows a little bit about.
0.0	0.484383517433	Because in the end, my goal is not simply to live on this earth for 80 years, but to live an eternity with my creator.
0.0	0.465865093957	So I want us to have a very tough screening process but I want that process to go forward.
0.0	0.486607744755	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.458959775195	I've had my issues with Donald Trump.
0.0	0.457800026252	And I won't be angry when we fix it, but until we fix it, I'm very, very angry.
0.0	0.446906386315	But when you're a governor, you have to admit it.
0.0	0.466296876873	Obamacare, we're going to repeal it and replace it.
0.0	0.473674169513	During the Cold War -- during the Cold War, we got into a bad habit of always looking to see who was wearing the jersey of the communists, and who was wearing the U.S. jersey.
0.0	0.483498555897	So let's support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition.
0.0	0.471179927574	They go back and forth between Syria and this region.
0.0	0.430401200213	How do we decide on who gets to follow up?
0.0	0.476403615674	But let me just say that we also need down -- to tear down the cyber walls that China is erecting, that Russia is erecting.
0.0	0.483756372943	Well, if that's the case, we're going to win every state, if Bernie Sanders is the nominee.
1.0	0.494844250109	And they've stolen from you because now they know they cannot pay these benefits and Social Security is going to be insolvent in seven to eight years.
0.0	0.475230013725	Marco opposed this because they made a deal.
0.0	0.408029769081	Check it out.
0.0	0.489603549642	Well, and specifically to Medicare, Becky, because 85 percent of the cost of Medicare is chronic disease.
0.0	0.47214762822	I was invoked in that question, so let me just say -- in that answer -- let me say, the real question here, I hate to interrupt this episode of Court TV.
0.0	0.450050146877	It turns out we knew something was wrong.
0.0	0.454340643272	Let me give you the bad news.
0.0	0.459082737995	I'm never going to change my tune.
0.0	0.492895735447	ISIS came in, and now occupies significant territory in Libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold.
0.0	0.5	We're asking the top 1.5 percent, including passive income, to start paying a little bit more so that the elderly and disabled vets in this country can live with security and dignity.
0.0	0.401901202335	OK...
0.0	0.459306826128	We're not going to solve this problem with traditional politics.
0.0	0.458026513467	We need much more than that.
0.0	0.48380651686	And we finally need to tackle the basics to cut this government down to size and hold it accountable.
0.0	0.468844250119	I have lobbyists that can produce anything for me.
0.0	0.487515502572	That very first time they show up with a near miss, we should be intervening there.
0.0	0.483991529226	The business flat tax, they already impose their taxes on us, so there's no reciprocal...
0.0	0.478834990779	This is the new sort of challenge, the new sort of threat that does, in fact, require new thinking, fresh approaches and new leadership.
0.0	0.479309571774	He is becoming ISIS's best recruiter.
0.0	0.5	He might not take my phone call, but he would get the message, and the message is this: Until you open every nuclear and every military facility to full, open, anytime/anywhere, for real, inspections, we are going to make it as difficult as possible for you to move money around the global financial system.
0.0	0.5	But I did pass a more progressive income tax and asked the highest-earning people to pay another 14 percent.
0.0	0.448390988132	They don't want them made here.
0.0	0.475252313346	And I can do it regardless of what the makeup of Congress is because I did it in New York state.
0.0	0.492242836266	She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video.
0.0	0.481883979009	But I wouldn't even waste my time with this one.
0.0	0.445133912887	I don't need the rhetoric.
0.0	0.5	So, let's not in anyway imply here that either President Obama or myself, would in anyway not take on any vested interested, whether it's Wall Street, or drug companies, or insurance companies, or frankly, the gun lobby to stand up to do what's best for the American people.
0.0	0.444093397227	John, I'll tell you something.
0.0	0.481408318437	But I would probably have my children run it with my executives and I wouldn't ever be involved because I wouldn't care about anything but our country, anything.
0.0	0.476347712896	Somebody who is very fond of the president, agrees with him most of the time, I disagree with his recent deportation policies.
0.0	0.473636460169	Well, first of all, I've seen polls where I'm beating Hillary Clinton pretty regularly.
0.0	0.465993603636	The question was, would you meet with an adversary without conditions?
0.0	0.47608717856	And we need to do that throughout the country.
0.0	0.469759439738	And what I have said is I will not throw us further into debt.
0.0	0.446885951062	I'll tell you how optimistic I am about America.
0.0	0.472397896814	We desperately need a conservative leader as president of the United States.
0.0	0.457406316214	We got nothing but problems.
0.0	0.5	But the best way to close this gap is to modernize higher education so Americans have the skills for those jobs.
0.0	0.5	I don't know if people understand, but I spent a lifetime with my colleagues getting us to a federal balanced budget.
0.0	0.463067767517	That means medical.
0.0	0.410675621284	We have to obey the laws.
0.0	0.430815868371	I like them.
0.0	0.475352610507	And places like Seattle, like Los Angeles, like New York City, they can go higher.
0.0	0.480565906617	And it is from the lessons from history that we do this because if we allow this to fester, we're going to have Islamic terrorism, multi-generations of it all across this country.
0.0	0.429898753981	All right.
0.0	0.479640706364	The first vote hasn't been counted.
0.0	0.458571266801	We can develop that, you know?
0.0	0.463223669192	Just want to get that out there, just saying.
0.0	0.48142603976	And I will also go after executives who are responsible for the decisions that have such bad consequences for our country.
0.0	0.412868148225	Think of it.
0.0	0.482629428957	And remember, the Russians have not gone after ISIS or any of the other terrorist groups.
0.0	0.458051875768	Yes, our allies are not perfect.
1.0	0.478123710348	Even our nuclear arsenal doesn't work.
0.0	0.477804529413	Actually going to do something to help the American worker.
0.0	0.450600880524	They don't like NBC, but I like the poll.
0.0	0.417240963776	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.474154186929	This entire question was an attack, but that's (inaudible)
0.0	0.444890842088	This is beyond anybody's expectations.
0.0	0.464390516683	Martha, we offered a lot more than they were willing to take.
0.0	0.47083821776	Well, Maria, thank you for that question, and let me say thank you to the state of South Carolina for welcoming us.
0.0	0.476543781982	I look at the roads being built all over the country, and I say I can build those things for one-third.
0.0	0.435871520898	David, I am the very first...
0.0	0.432668701649	We're dying.
0.0	0.5	Low income people who are not involved in the political process.
0.0	0.471645875461	I believe that our Constitution protects everybody, regardless of their sexual orientation or any other aspect.
0.0	0.411781211145	I love China.
0.0	0.45066674638	You don't hear it from anybody else.
0.0	0.378325320365	Excuse me.
0.0	0.489563648082	... and that's what you and others can start providing in the Senate.
0.0	0.456644256829	Al Qaida was based in Afghanistan.
0.0	0.5	As a result, eight credit upgrades; as a result, a top ten state for private sector job creation.
0.0	0.494902104806	People lost their jobs, their homes, their life savings.
0.0	0.481702742506	Many are in this building.
0.0	0.478814834124	We put in place child care support.
0.0	0.471600388234	My daughters went to college on a mountain of bills.
0.0	0.490392993956	There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies.
0.0	0.457640066404	Before this, I was a very successful person as a developer and as a businessman.
0.0	0.474466162624	My 750,000 donors have contributed more than a million and a half donations.
0.0	0.462129833636	That is not protected free speech.
0.0	0.469278344542	Let me do that but let me pick up on an issue, a very important issue that we have not yet discussed.
0.0	0.448989903336	I'm tired of the hyphenated Americans and the division.
0.0	0.463980450178	And when our staffers said, "whoa, what's going here?"
0.0	0.477054758095	It was 25 years ago, and I came by defeating the Democratic incumbent.
0.0	0.493013593537	So what I will tell you about our incentives -- our incentives are tight, and at the end of the day we make sure that we gain more from the creation of jobs than what we lose.
0.0	0.444887479808	You should not have to borrow a dime to pay tuition.
0.0	0.472344410303	I am the man who can bring us together to do that, and I ask for your vote.
0.0	0.464496081944	But for that Texas police officer, we could have had a mass murder.
0.0	0.419999972407	As an outsider, I tackled H.P.
0.0	0.469738499132	Can I just add one very quick thing?
0.0	0.481266403075	I like Chris Christie, but we can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports Common Core.
0.0	0.369588475859	slot.
0.0	0.473665640864	I was responsible for the convention center on the west side.
0.0	0.472325939402	Every time we send signals like this, we send a signal of weakness, not strength.
0.0	0.484785769139	There are other attorneys that feel, and very, very fine constitutional attorneys, that feel that because he was not born on the land, he cannot run for office.
0.0	0.423122808648	That is absolutely inaccurate.
0.0	0.490007204127	They have a sophisticated understanding of our legal immigration system and we now have an obligation to ensure that they are not able to use that system against us.
1.0	0.568270617241	When I look at the migration, I looked at the line, I said it actually on your show recently, where are the women?
0.0	0.46078762307	And as a result of that, the shah of Iran came in, terrible dictator.
0.0	0.435876456756	He got lucky with fracking.
0.0	0.462626463195	You just have to look today at Indonesia, bombings all over.
0.0	0.489217005812	And I thought it was horrible when it was broadcast on television, because boy, does that send signals to Putin and all of the other people that look at us and they say, "That is a group of people, and that is a nation that truly has no clue.
0.0	0.478549822758	And we fell into the same trap with Assad, saying -- as if it's our job to say, Assad must go.
0.0	0.5	We're going to combine all commercial activity in business into one place in the tax code and charge it 15 percent, which is going to suddenly make us competitive with the rest of the world.
0.0	0.467986891154	You also have to get rid of all the deductions and all the loopholes.
0.0	0.470584639491	We're a country of laws, Bill.
0.0	0.526597510833	That's it.
0.0	0.492391404004	The only way to figure that out is to go back to getting the intelligence community the funding and the tools that it needs to be able to keep America safe.
0.0	0.455614718723	And it's not just a question for parents and grandparents to answer.
0.0	0.482526380072	So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives.
0.0	0.425992723144	Ninety-three hours.
0.0	0.484709813405	If you listen to the State of the Union the other night, he described them as a bunch of guys with long beards on the back of a pickup truck.
0.0	0.455629012435	That's not why I ran for office.
0.0	0.492857559653	There is one major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.441496560453	My name was mentioned.
0.0	0.401882560364	DICKERSON: A question from Kathie Obradovich.
1.0	0.593236680975	And they would, despite all their tough talk about terrorism, continue to let people who are on the no-fly list buy guns.
0.0	0.482422210178	My point is this: I won two landslide elections, I made big changes.
0.0	0.475728011806	For a start, they're going to start to pay their fair share of taxes.
0.0	0.442326914448	That I can tell you.
0.0	0.464671348359	Thank you, good night and may the force be with you.
0.0	0.481396391738	But the differences among us pale compared to what's happening on the Republican side.
0.0	0.470111189659	I think the times are different now.
0.0	0.458593795453	Finally, we'll take off the political handcuffs.
0.0	0.480099802327	Now, thank God, my father was invited to a Bible study and became born again and he came back to my mom and me and we were raised together.
0.0	0.48182650431	I will take her on, and when I take her on I guarantee you one thing, she will never get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.466789188533	I am a 2nd amendment person.
1.0	0.579854090983	We are now doing an independent internal investigation to see who else was involved.
0.0	0.464868871713	We need somebody who can lead.
0.0	0.5	Well, we have treated the drug-addicted in our prisons and we released them in to the community, and our recidivism rate is less than 20 percent.
0.0	0.475547594211	Turns out that the African-American community and the Latino community were hit especially hard.
0.0	0.458576500864	I know that because I buy the product."
0.0	0.477355277042	So the fact is that we work for the people.
0.0	0.382859102389	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.487125564658	We have to end -- education has to be local.
0.0	0.468388362282	Is there an area for a safety net?
0.0	0.397679747704	Thank you, Marco.

0.0	0.478522286424	And I ask everyone in America to call Congress tomorrow and say enough is enough; no more debt.
0.0	0.402917124465	I promise.
0.0	0.450008915084	I believe we've got to go further.
0.0	0.437196178114	That makes no sense to everybody.
0.0	0.459410500955	...is paid -- played fairly.
0.0	0.468022933043	Let's quit making it a problem for them.
0.0	0.485734082545	Today, many of us picked up our newspapers, and we were horrified to see the sight of 10 American sailors on their knees, with their hands on their heads.
0.0	0.478380767007	But Iran is at the heart of most of the evil that is going on in the Middle East through their proxies.
0.0	0.470901903451	Look, I am in the establishment because my dad, the greatest man alive was president of the United States and my brother, who I adore as well as fantastic brother was president.
0.0	0.435630135872	And if I were the prosecutor, that is exactly where they would be.
0.0	0.5	Yeah, we can create 13 million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure at a cost of a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.490154354357	But the truth of the matter is, if we want wages to go up, we've got to get 11 million of our neighbors out of off the book shadow economy, and into the full light of an American economy.
0.0	0.464539364181	I will stand firm.
0.0	0.492500091495	A healthy environment, a strong economy and energy independent America -- that would be the purpose of my presidency, is break the strangle hold that people enjoy on fossil fuels who hate our guts.
0.0	0.455554946981	I'm going to get a response to that, Neil.
0.0	0.45080620086	With all -- with all due respect...
0.0	0.431216782049	Go ahead.
0.0	0.454100583843	That's his first responsibility.
0.0	0.481487584131	That's the difference, and that's the kind of leader we need in the White House.
0.0	0.438666783957	Well, they're glitches because...
0.0	0.453832343205	What part is valid?
0.0	0.472715461733	This is why, fundamentally, we have to take our government back.
1.0	0.56923882243	The blurb said that the next president of the United States has got to be aggressive in bringing people into the political process.
0.0	0.48243173562	I want to find out -- many people saw pipe bombs and all sorts of things all over their apartment.
0.0	0.429019012088	Illegal.
0.0	0.459116391135	Planned Parenthood will be defunded.
0.0	0.486611667488	Number one, the people negotiating don't have a clue.
0.0	0.482297568622	We do have to take a hard look at the defense budget and we do have to figure out how we get ready to fight the adversaries of the future, not the past.
0.0	0.463089801898	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.512145917583	If we were to raise the marginal rate to 45 percent for people earning more than a million dollars and if we tax capital gains essentially the same we do earnings from hard work and sweat and toil, you could generate $800 billion over the next ten years and that would do so much good for affordable college, debt-free college, cutting youth unemployment in half, investing in our cities again.
0.0	0.490146895849	And that would I think give the American public a bit more of a sense of security about who is being processed and who might end up coming as refugees.
0.0	0.468119739074	I think the American people are look for real leadership.
0.0	0.408027428687	They're off to China.
0.0	0.485460240671	We've got challenges in the South China Sea because of what China is doing in building up these military installations.
0.0	0.526597510833	But...
0.0	0.472492654452	Well, if the law would change, yeah.
0.0	0.456194187785	I want to take off from that point and argue the same thing.
0.0	0.487491366298	We also got rid of their chemical weapons, which was a big help, and we also went after a lot of the shoulder-fired missiles to round them up.
0.0	0.483259991049	And, it was made for we the people, we are the ones who decide who we are, and we should never give away the values and principles that made America into a great nation for the sake of political correctness.
0.0	0.478175070658	Let me just add one thing about ISIS over there.
1.0	0.5	In fact, the largest after- tax gains is for the people at the lower end of the tax spectrum under my plan.
0.0	0.460509874766	And we have no quarrel with the Iranian people.
0.0	0.456056049349	I mean, just think about a scenario like that.
0.0	0.465779162328	You know the nice thing about the mainstream media, they don't hide their views.
0.0	0.492587264552	Not committing crimes and earn legal status where you're not cutting in front of the line for people that are patiently waiting outside.
0.0	0.46589603104	But this is what we also have to say.
0.0	0.447947369477	Really big league.

0.0	0.464635995769	Yes, we need to make it easier for parents to refinance.
0.0	0.491105089758	Obviously, in the first, we do have to have a -- an American-led air campaign, we have to have Arab and Kurdish troops on the ground.
0.0	0.49045386952	I mean, we've seen time and time again, especially in this very troubled region of nation-state failures, and then we have no idea who the next generation of leaders are that are coming forward.
0.0	0.459866941851	Let people play, who cares?
0.0	0.460067410322	You learn that threats always change.
0.0	0.431608730071	That's what Chris Stevens was trying to do.
0.0	0.321389529923	Thank you.
0.0	0.482217969656	So we have a lot of work to do to get jobs going again, get incomes rising again.

0.0	0.481387394171	Saudi Arabia without us is gone.
0.0	0.457216657809	Well, John, I don't really have any weaknesses that I can think of.
0.0	0.492881370335	As president, I will support law enforcement and we'll stop radical terrorist attacks in this country by supporting our intelligence community and law enforcement community.
0.0	0.477580187666	But we can give people better health care.
0.0	0.437992112187	I've always listened to you, Megyn.
0.0	0.5	Until we have a president of the United States that gets up every day and goes to the Oval Office with the intent purpose of securing that border, and there's not anybody on either one of these stages that has the experience of dealing with this as I have for over 14 years with that 1200-mile border.
0.0	0.481630171503	We need radical changes in mental health in America so somebody who is suicidal or homicidal can get the emergency care they need.
0.0	0.448797262549	There are a lot of factors involved in that.
0.0	0.47733059268	When I think about the folks who are out there at home tonight watching, and I think about what they had to watch this week -- the spectacle they had to watch on the floor of the House of Representatives, with the president of the United States, who talked a fantasy land about the way they're feeling.
0.0	0.4601071515	I just wish he wouldn't misrepresent mine.
0.0	0.461635339201	So, here's a couple of stories happened recently.
0.0	0.437490716949	I do respect Rand.
0.0	0.5	And it costs, with dynamic scoring, less than a trillion dollars.
1.0	0.624363083343	Americans haven't had a raise in 15 years.
0.0	0.474720981451	And that someone in that office has to do their job.
0.0	0.466668900712	That's why we have this abnormal situation going on right now.
0.0	0.465875232689	Well, thank you very much for hosting this debate, and let me applaud my colleagues up here.
0.0	0.471182974181	But in two seconds, they give me whatever I wanted.
0.0	0.384692045917	Here's the story.
0.0	0.462189539039	You ought to just be able to get over it, get used to it...
0.0	0.4215442384	I'm proud of my family.
0.0	0.481699980361	In 2011, the sequester was passed as a reform to slow down the rate of government.
0.0	0.483961627629	... and I've had more two a.m. phone calls than everybody here put together, making life and death decisions, put together very complex teams to accomplish things that have never been done before.
0.0	0.485589792887	I believe that actually affordable college, debt-free college is the goal that we need to attain as a nation.
0.0	0.452119830364	Because now he's going a little bit better.
0.0	0.526597510833	Again...
0.0	0.481697636636	Be careful of a bubble because what you've seen in the past might be small potatoes compared to what happens.
0.0	0.419840411096	We have to stand with them.
0.0	0.48288349727	You know, in our country, there are a lot of people who feel as though they just don't have the power.
0.0	0.475136958448	America is best when we work in collaboration with our allies.
0.0	0.422301430922	Yes.
0.0	0.5	Today congress decided to take another $150 billion dollars away from Social Security so they can borrow more money.
0.0	0.484277269296	I mean, you looked at Bush, it took him five days to answer the question on Iraq.
0.0	0.417051919461	Go on to martinomalley.com.
0.0	0.483581620822	There is no challenge too great for the United States to confront, provided we have the ability and the courage to put forward new leadership that can move us to those better and safer and more prosperous days.
0.0	0.360143435691	...Chris...
0.0	0.5	Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the co-chair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat.
0.0	0.431630328083	He was a little teddy bear to me.
1.0	0.5	Well, the average small manufacturer, whatever they're manufacturing, drugs or anything, if they have less than 50 employees, the average cost in terms of regulations is $34,000 per employee.
0.0	0.479273224077	But the problem with free trade is you need really talented people to negotiate for you.
0.0	0.488915119375	Now it is their time to help the middle class.
0.0	0.482116448437	The idea of 401(k)s. I have a small business that I set up.
0.0	0.472804935651	It's the only way you fix Medicare, the only way you fix Social Security.
0.0	0.48165779553	Now the Libyans are turning their attention to try to dislodge ISIS from its foothold and begin to try to move together to have a unified nation.
0.0	0.486931053061	It brought booming economic growth and that growth fueled rebuilding the military.
0.0	0.460914434424	Their business model is greed and fraud.
0.0	0.5	I believe that we need to cut these taxes down, we need to be on a roadmap to balancing the budget, and we need to send power, money, and influence, the welfare department, the education department, job training, infrastructure, Medicaid, all of that out of Washington back to the states so we can run these programs from where we live to the top, not a one size fits all mentality that they have in Washington.
0.0	0.431433073864	They shouldn't be going to Europe.
0.0	0.422889465113	So, I thank you very much for that.
0.0	0.491056931761	You know, we could give you another example -- the Marines, the Army, these wonderful six soldiers that were killed.
0.0	0.402032515142	Great.
0.0	0.5	We ought to give them a little bit of a liability release so that they share data amongst themselves and share data with the federal government, they're not fearful of a lawsuit.
0.0	0.47680277946	Effectively it is day trading without any regulation at all.
0.0	0.484045736366	I would hope that we could all agree that we are sick and tired of seeing videos on television of unarmed people, often African-Americans, shot by police officers.
0.0	0.491099966935	We got to do a lot about the high cost of high -- higher education, but we've got to make sure we're training people for jobs that exist, that are good jobs that can pay.
0.0	0.46606711215	May I have a chance to respond to this issue?
0.0	0.470295183461	But the Democrats are going to bring a lawsuit, and you have to have certainty.
0.0	0.476638121233	These attack ads are going to be part of life.
0.0	0.446676832766	Does anyone know this?"
0.0	0.403555716613	Okay.
0.0	0.477224976735	They've been stepped on for too long in this society, and we are beginning to treat them.
0.0	0.473994531918	Well, let's take it one at a time.
0.0	0.453028862657	No one is a socialist.
0.0	0.475198110753	... and we will end the illegal immigration.
0.0	0.507105296098	So yes, I will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year pay zero, zero in federal income tax.
0.0	0.456427581856	It was Countrywide Mortgage.
1.0	0.624469531747	Senator Sanders voted to give immunity to gun dealers.
0.0	0.477087602609	And if people want a more high-minded politics and want to move our country forward, go on to martinomalley.com and help my campaign move our country forward.
0.0	0.419014847792	I'll talk to them.
0.0	0.47057086262	That will never happen when I am president of the United States.
0.0	0.5	This debate needs to be about the men and women across this country that are struggling on a daily basis to provide for their families the better future that we've always said this country is all about.
0.0	0.526597510833	What do we do?

0.0	0.491078803692	As a matter of fact, if you're Hispanic or African-American in Texas, you have the number one high school graduation rates in America.
0.0	0.5	Under my plan, no business, big or small, will pay more than 25 percent flat rate on their business income.
1.0	0.494052327036	The truth of the matter is, net immigration from Mexico last year was zero.
0.0	0.457445824903	But let's not -- but let's not -- let's not insult -- let's not insult the intelligence of the American people.
0.0	0.417051919461	...before I go.
0.0	0.487220461431	Well, as you know, I'm a former elected prosecutor, a former elected attorney general, trained at the University of Virginia in constitutional law, and I don't believe in litmus tests except this.
0.0	0.494718149157	And that's an economy where ordinary Americans are working longer hours for low wagers.
0.0	0.481965872442	Maybe that is normal politics in Washington, but that is not the politics of higher purpose that people expect from our party.
0.0	0.478126171163	Maria, you look at what this president and his secretary of state, Secretary of State Clinton, has done to get us in this spot.
0.0	0.474136288135	I was very honored to be asked to do that and very honored to serve with him those first four years.
0.0	0.484520027948	I think that is the smartest way to be able to move forward because if you go to $12 it would be the highest historical average we've ever had.
0.0	0.47297617984	No interest," because I don't need anybody's money.
0.0	0.482356774983	The head of Ford will call me back, I would say within an hour after I told them the bad news.
0.0	0.448377073968	We have to rebuild our infrastructure.
0.0	0.476647642097	Because Obama and Clinton policies, the United States is moving further and further into a decline.
0.0	0.447460675095	We will do very, very well, very, very well.
0.0	0.435038967812	Fine, I'll take it.
0.0	0.482266005956	She put American intelligence officers at risk for her convenience.
0.0	0.526597510833	No.
0.0	0.471517183917	I think it ought to be a compact -- families contribute, kids contribute.
0.0	0.483164653266	Well, I would begin by reminding people that at this point in previous presidential elections, Jimmy Carter couldn't win, Ronald Reagan couldn't win, Bill Clinton couldn't win, and neither could've Barack Obama.
0.0	0.448957361722	We have made some good progress.
0.0	0.46349014174	It's like them getting mugged, and then us saying, well, we're going to mug you some more.
0.0	0.472676056651	When I am president of the United States of America, there will never be any cap-and-trade in the United States.

0.0	0.459306421954	My mother is on Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.478404471165	This is the same old stuff since I left.
0.0	0.443343168958	It's true, and these are the best and the finest.
0.0	0.464410701591	You know, I know to a lot of people in the media, this is just a great big game, and we're the players.
0.0	0.526597510833	That is...
0.0	0.470770428136	You know, when Senator Sanders talks about a coalition, I agree with him about that.
0.0	0.451865922383	I'd like to jump in.
0.0	0.427822969883	And I apologize to nobody for that.
0.0	0.466631348852	I would choose Nelson Mandela for his generosity of heart, his understanding of the need for reconciliation.
0.0	0.481531922941	I'm hoping that because of the very recent announcement of the agreement at the Security Council, which embodies actually an agreement that I negotiated back in Geneva in June of 2012, we're going to get a diplomatic effort in Syria to begin to try to make a transition.
0.0	0.430962303666	The answer is yes.
0.0	0.433542921916	Don't believe it.
0.0	0.437611433611	Let's listen to them and let's not listen to our politicians.
0.0	0.438857369334	The formula is working.
0.0	0.5	I went into Ohio where we had an $8 billion hole and now we have a $2 billion surplus.
0.0	0.473399059888	I think we're on the verge of the greatest time, and I want to fix the things to let people rise up.
0.0	0.491596683952	I have made very clear that hardworking, middle-class families need a raise, not a tax increase.
0.0	0.463075361842	So, you know, it's fine for you to say what you're going to say, but I looked very carefully at your proposal.
0.0	0.48059828504	I have supported a consensus approach to solving this problem wherever it came up.
1.0	0.58522591185	And Iranian wise guys having guns to their heads.
0.0	0.468077866274	You know, they feel like if they don't have a lobbyist, if they're not wealthy, that somehow they don't get to play.
0.0	0.428003795296	I said no.
0.0	0.481242856353	That cost gets passed on to the people.
0.0	0.438553655659	Because I've done it.
0.0	0.470317142162	Look, I think we are readier than we used to be, but it's a constant effort that has to be undertaken to make sure we are as ready as we need to be.
0.0	0.454432393115	But Bret, here's the problem.
0.0	0.5	Number two, this was the man that was a managing general partner at Lehman Brothers when it went down the tubes and almost took every one of us with it, including Ben and myself, because I was there and I watched what happened.
0.0	0.475602030944	I want to do more to help incentivize and create more small businesses.
0.0	0.468419029089	I believe that the goal should be debt-free college.
0.0	0.474781008152	You had two one hundred...
0.0	0.48065021678	I put together a coalition, including Arabs, with respect to Libya and a coalition to put sanctions onto Iran.
0.0	0.5	We need to make the government run smarter and better, and reform this corporate tax system, bring that money back to the United States to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, and we need to use it also to protect our grid from terrorists.
0.0	0.471784409292	They're devaluing their currency to a level that you wouldn't believe.
0.0	0.458375969138	So those are some of the areas that I think we've got to move on.
0.0	0.506182021275	I built a net worth of way over $10 billion, and I have done it four times out of hundreds.
0.0	0.5	And I give you my word, if I am elected president, no service man or service woman will be forced to be on their knees, and any nation that captures our fighting men will feel the full force and fury of the United States of America.
0.0	0.5	So it's not just the government -- the private sector companies, it's also our own government that needs to raise the level of our game.
0.0	0.461047430444	First of all, let's have some rules here, commentators.
0.0	0.477260652307	I don't get any money from Wall Street.
0.0	0.476884448433	And for the sake of our economy, they must -- the major banks must be broken up.
0.0	0.464772842396	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.491713670895	Those jobs, in many cases, are now gone.
0.0	0.404109758581	And what is that proposal?
1.0	0.615856907989	We're spending $80 billion a year locking up fellow Americans.
0.0	0.452363996045	It's very bad for us.
0.0	0.468925956257	2016 is going to be a fight between conservatism, and a Democrat party that is undermining the very character of this nation.
0.0	0.5	Well, let's just -- let's just follow up on this, because, you know, I've made it very clear that no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail, and because of Dodd-Frank, we now have in law a process that the president, the Federal Reserve, and others can use if any bank poses a systemic risk.
0.0	0.493227179255	It's a simple formula: common sense regulations, which is why I think we should freeze all federal regulations for one year, except for health and safety.
0.0	0.443547496117	We don't need anything.
0.0	0.480921065859	ISIS has now attacked a western democracy in -- in France.

0.0	0.478531697319	Number two, I'm a private company, so nobody knows what I'm worth.
0.0	0.477403139019	Not just the hacking of OPM, but that is -- that is just shameful.
0.0	0.5	The statistics from Wisconsin are particularly troubling, because it is the highest rate of incarceration for African-Americans in our nation, twice the national average.
0.0	0.5	They are the best funded radical jihadist group in the history of the world, and they have shown a sophisticated understanding of the laws of other countries on how to insert fighters into places, and they are actively plotting to attack us here at home and around the world.
0.0	0.486448070376	There is a war against ISIS, not just against ISIS but against radical jihadists terrorists, and it is a war that they win or we win.
0.0	0.443103510271	Marco Rubio, why don't you resign?
0.0	0.450621471885	I changed it in New Jersey.
0.0	0.475682780388	For 30 years this country has been baited with that.
0.0	0.465229782306	And it was with us for months, the smell, the air.
0.0	0.466758919715	I don't want campaign contributions from corporate America.
0.0	0.5	We were one of two states to go to AAA bond rating, and our government spending was far less than the spending in people's income.
0.0	0.483431036285	But the average person takes out about $350,000.
0.0	0.46787096644	We've got to have them be part of our coalition.
0.0	0.487410423068	And as someone who's worn the uniform of the country, that's how we build our military back up.
0.0	0.39847947423	Absolutely.
0.0	0.444468198212	I saw them come down.
0.0	0.459313769638	Makes it a whole lot easier for them to want to go somewhere else.
0.0	0.454187425238	A rich person does not.
1.0	0.583574375734	That's wrong.
0.0	0.47426584542	Donald Trump, for example -- I'm glad -- I mentioned his name again just if anybody was missing him...
0.0	0.39847947423	Absolutely.
0.0	0.48778837333	The student loan problem has been created by government.
0.0	0.466079890945	It's why you see the pharmaceuticals getting together.
0.0	0.433801974009	Look at what's happening with the Republicans.
0.0	0.407869712071	So I would say, "Congratulations.
0.0	0.485702197857	But I think a pause on Syrian refugees has been exactly right for all the governors that have called for it, and also, of course, for me as the governor of Ohio.
0.0	0.43354249201	But, let me tell you who not to blame.
0.0	0.494765145193	But when millions of people stand up and are prepared to take on the insurance companies and the drug companies, it will happen, and I will lead that effort.
0.0	0.446531776444	If we do that again, we will lose again, we will deserve to lose again.
0.0	0.488825446503	And after four or five years in Brooklyn, I ventured into Manhattan and did a lot of great deals -- the Grand Hyatt Hotel.
1.0	0.494223851329	In 2008, Barack Obama missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes, and the same newspaper endorsed him again.
0.0	0.477395558818	It is because in this nation, we are influenced by Judeo-Christian values that teach us to care for the less fortunate, to reach out to the needy, to love our neighbor.
0.0	0.445018421601	And Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being the commander-in-chief of the United States.
0.0	0.471579706724	Gosh, if you guys ask one more mean question I may have to leave the stage.
0.0	0.439003978785	We lose on trade.
1.0	0.636980189635	Women should not be making 79 cents on the dollar compared to that.
0.0	0.478884376998	It is hard to find someone in my generation that thinks Social Security will be there for us.
0.0	0.488978083029	Prior to that, in the Reagan Library, I gave a detailed plan.
0.0	0.526597510833	No.
0.0	0.472320587588	And I've done it in the state of Ohio as the chief executive.
0.0	0.442947334078	So here's this -- the situation, I think, Maria.
0.0	0.476862765153	Number two, we had a really good plan.
0.0	0.401147044455	What's crony capitalism?
0.0	0.482188569333	I've heard them talk about deporting 10 or 11 -- people here from this country out of this country, splitting families.
0.0	0.439239992658	I've laid out...
1.0	0.488898903684	Well, John, look, I think that what happened when we abided by the agreement that George W. Bush made with the Iraqis to leave by 2011, is that an Iraqi army was left that had been trained and that was prepared to defend Iraq.
0.0	0.485868056486	You can -- you can deal with the threat of terror and also recognize that this country should be aspirational across the board.
0.0	0.452537752347	Yes, they control them.
0.0	0.47725322215	They shouldn't automatically assume that because you believe that marriage is between one man and one woman that you are a homophobe.
0.0	0.469741310926	No, I've never made a promise like that.
0.0	0.415270179719	That's American citizenship.
0.0	0.466835398157	I believe calling it what it is, is to say radical jihadis.
0.0	0.468448951737	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.46885669269	And when I'm president, I can tell you this, my faith will not just influence the way I'll govern as president, it will influence the way I live my life.
0.0	0.466752555487	... with what Marco is saying is that it takes too long, they're sucking us dry and it takes too long.
0.0	0.457826820629	And I would not stand for that as president of the United States.
0.0	0.490529119112	I am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of Vermont from very significant majorities of women.
0.0	0.457591935898	No, the new planes.
0.0	0.481832477481	I think it is fair to say, whatever the complaints that you want to make about him are, that with respect to China, one of the most challenging relationships we have, his opening up China and his ongoing relationships with the leaders of China is an incredibly useful relationship for the United States of America.
0.0	0.484131356619	But I also want to create jobs and I want to be a partner with the private sector.
0.0	0.428379996518	And he got nasty.
0.0	0.471003194704	And -- and -- you know, the concept of New York values is not that complicated to figure out.
0.0	0.486619921373	I have yet to see a proposal that you're describing that the -- raising the cap would apply to passive income.
0.0	0.490388445811	And the one thing is that when you run, you have to announce and certify to all sorts of governmental authorities your net worth.
0.0	0.484967856904	And I believe that we can springboard off of this new U.N. resolution, and we should create, as Secretary Clinton indicated, and I agree with that, that there should be a political process.
0.0	0.461262017855	That's the wrong number.
0.0	0.485649547876	The fact that it's happened for so many people here throughout our history, that's what makes us special.
1.0	0.611769000596	And again, paid for.
0.0	0.468730276723	It's time for us to stand up for what we believe in.
0.0	0.489058754187	Why does the pharmaceutical industry make huge campaign contributions?
1.0	0.455470187932	They're bringing crime.
0.0	0.470266310238	Like rich kids, they deserve to get a free education.
0.0	0.46985281222	It took -- it took an arm and a leg to be able to set up a 401(k).
0.0	0.419713775817	I came as a reformer.
0.0	0.480816518478	See, I was there when Reagan rebuilt the military.
0.0	0.489259902151	Here's why, the president of the United States and both his attorney's general, they give the benefit of the doubt to the criminal, not to the police officers.
0.0	0.446783810638	Believe me, folks.
0.0	0.445362357455	You know what he said to me?
0.0	0.474476116277	I'm very angry because our country is being run horribly and I will gladly accept the mantle of anger.
0.0	0.475446650797	It's absolutely the case that if people feel that the game is rigged, that has consequences.
0.0	0.460074552867	I'll tell you, in my family there are a lot of single moms in my family.
0.0	0.448851208766	And we can't be the stupid country any more.
0.0	0.481709267701	We're bringing corporate taxes down, bringing money back in, corporate inversions.
0.0	0.465277665583	And I'll allow putting that tariff or whatever he's saying here...
0.0	0.46122133637	So, I'm proud of Senator Sanders, and his supporters.
0.0	0.475558613063	You know, I have said -- I have said many times, you know, I'm not asking people to support me because I'm a woman.
0.0	0.397278240087	Thank you, John.
0.0	0.44659709984	And I could say, oh, I'm not angry.
0.0	0.478683218078	I just want to remind you, people paid their money.
0.0	0.477924969192	Well, look, I believe that we've made great progress as a country with the Affordable Care Act.
0.0	0.440463801434	(LAUGHTER) And he got nasty.
0.0	0.472694820669	I talked about Donald Trump from the standpoint of being an individual who was using his celebrity rather than his conservatism.
0.0	0.464625585178	Every election we talk about this.
0.0	0.454899471676	Now, Donald...
0.0	0.372039130143	John.
0.0	0.471693331559	Why should we let their people be sitting there smoking their cigars, sitting in their comfortable chairs in Raqqa?
0.0	0.489473426159	And when you have insider information, which apparently has been the case, where people use that information and use big data to try to take advantage of it, there has to be some regulation.
1.0	0.628503082224	We pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.
0.0	0.464981043783	The guns don't pull the trigger.
0.0	0.461042766523	They do not want us to exercise religious liberty.
0.0	0.479724637304	It's a huge public health challenge.
0.0	0.424936271317	You can have him.
0.0	0.481456758974	On January 20th, 2017, the next president of the United States will walk into the White House.
0.0	0.474816026526	We can take many of those same procedures, we can apply it to Medicare.
0.0	0.491338278794	Spent the first seven years of his life in Fascist Italy, under Benito Mussolini.
0.0	0.474822531512	That's where crime is happening in these cities where they don't enforce the immigration laws.
0.0	0.482400888395	I believe if this amendment were to pass, the chances of this bill passing into law would increase dramatically.
0.0	0.468151877862	As you too know, I know I built a very great company.
0.0	0.475929976803	We raised the minimum wage.
0.0	0.473493476914	Of course, we're going to be a nation of immigrants.
0.0	0.449565295968	So we need to get on a different mindset.
0.0	0.482454205212	And in fact, in Obama administration, we did not meet with anybody without conditions.
0.0	0.483993503382	They want American troops back in the Middle East.
0.0	0.472944036507	When I was in Washington, I fought to get the budget balanced.
0.0	0.494413559902	Akin to slavery, where people came into this country to do guest work were abused, were exploited, and if they stood up for their rights, they'd be thrown out of this country.
0.0	0.488312930663	Our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.490872419376	Absolutely, because what we will do is say, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so they're not hanging out on street corners.
0.0	0.437461777886	I'd consider it.
0.0	0.492052442517	Well, Mr. Cooney, we've actually been focusing on border security to the exclusion of talking about comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.458986689778	I recommended that the president go forward.
0.0	0.474335771507	And I'll tell you what, Donald, you -- you very kindly just a moment ago offered me the V.P.
1.0	0.605558940958	Secondly, I think it's important to point out that about 3 percent of my donations come from people in the finance and investment world.
0.0	0.49101883916	But, more importantly, to train a Sunni-led force in Syria to take out ISIS with our support...
1.0	0.585824519636	Nobody knows who Mossadegh was, democratically-elected prime minister of Iran.
0.0	0.483602151995	I don't think it's so much about when the government orders a corporation to do something.
0.0	0.486782149781	Because, first of all, you may rename the IRS but you are not going to abolishes the IRS, because there has to be some agency that's going to collect your vat tax.
1.0	0.488355418456	And I know this, because when I ran for governor of New York, one in 11 of every man, woman, and child in the state of New York was on welfare.
0.0	0.408323734541	That's my view.
0.0	0.427923081373	John, could I follow up on this?
0.0	0.485987227352	But the ideal scenario is to train Americans to do the work so we don't have to rely on people from abroad.
0.0	0.448445563906	Well, I don't know.
0.0	0.451940111061	I think he'll be a great cheerleader for the country.
0.0	0.491065032834	And this is what we have to -- I -- I've got to tell you, when wages don't rise -- and they haven't for a lot of families for a number of years -- it's very, very difficult for them.
0.0	0.477436165067	... that after the 9/11 attacks, Secretary Rumsfeld invited me to the Pentagon with a meeting of the former secretaries of Defense.
0.0	0.442375286188	I just left Indonesia -- bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb.
0.0	0.481705378283	Now, who are the people who are hurt by that?
0.0	0.452484516363	I need your help.
0.0	0.465877807073	And the answer is: Because they know I will go right after them, that I will not let their agenda be America's agenda.
0.0	0.433447643105	They do whatever what they do, OK.
0.0	0.475093485148	We have to do the best possible job of sharing intelligence and information.
0.0	0.483403022052	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.429928345928	But I learned a lot.
0.0	0.45696257168	Socialist and government dependent.
0.0	0.456070442123	Let em also tell you...
0.0	0.460272022821	Everybody on this stage is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.451160965345	We have to do this in unison with the Arab world.
0.0	0.472605904727	It's perfectly legal in this country to change your mind.
0.0	0.485721952118	So, what we want to do is to say, look, we have 11 million people who have been here, many of them for decades.
0.0	0.464454790011	They can't even make a deal.
0.0	0.47230580103	I mean, let's talk about this arc of instability that Secretary Clinton talked about.
0.0	0.417510054379	And I hear their speeches.
0.0	0.477573528931	So what we do, though, is, if there is somebody who is price- gouging, we have laws for prosecutors to take that on.
0.0	0.486084297927	And aligned with a corrupt campaign finance system is a rigged economy.
0.0	0.45270996351	If he'd like to play, that's fine.
0.0	0.430625470103	We had Hezbollah.
0.0	0.430649392952	I don't care.
0.0	0.47773993691	We have three children, eight, five and one.
0.0	0.405787831067	You looking at me?
0.0	0.462871049655	Bill, here's the interesting position on this.
0.0	0.5	When extraordinarily wealthy people make very large contributions to Super PACs, and in many cases in this campaign, Super PACs have raised more money than individual candidates have, OK?
0.0	0.494556630641	The United States, at the same time, cannot successfully fight Assad and ISIS.
0.0	0.459833907204	Let me conclude by just saying this.
0.0	0.488886782547	And I took on the drug companies and I took on the insurance companies to try to get us universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.45905346948	That's how you make peace in the world.
0.0	0.469144058089	I will stop Iran from getting nuclear weapons.
0.0	0.470331350243	Rebuild the country's infrastructure.
0.0	0.46058359717	There are lids on people's aspirations.
0.0	0.471113469797	And you think about the reasons that we're having such difficulty right now with our job market.
0.0	0.466255221229	We're worried the future of our children and we've have been burned over and over again.
0.0	0.440761270643	We don't know anything about that.
0.0	0.459284499011	But guess who pushed for that regulation?
0.0	0.472703843285	So I don't know if you would call that a weakness, but my wife said "let up."
0.0	0.455898892704	And I think together we will make progress.
0.0	0.410138393004	I will not do that.
0.0	0.469849551274	We need to get a bipartisan commitment to work together on this.
0.0	0.443822545495	That was good for New York.
0.0	0.483570060153	We need to elect someone who will stand with the American people, who understands its greatness, who understands what an open economy and freedom is all about, but at the same time, has a record of being able to get things done in Washington like we've never seen before.
1.0	0.594941369725	Who denies that real unemployment today, including those who have given up looking for work and are working part-time is close to 10 percent?
0.0	0.491376671695	According to the generals that I know and trust, this air campaign will not destroy ISIL.
0.0	0.451409039932	Those aren't Iowa values, but this is what we believe in New York."
0.0	0.469317310311	Under the rules, I have been -- I have been invoked, David, so let me respond very quickly.
0.0	0.461985345213	They get good stories, because the newspapers get buffaloed (ph).
0.0	0.485501750011	... president of the United States has got to do, and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility, is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe.
0.0	0.321389529923	Thank you.
0.0	0.482164190832	Well, thank you very much to CBS and everyone here this evening for giving us another chance to appear before you.
0.0	0.484390318754	I think they made the Second Amendment the second amendment because they thought it was just that important.
0.0	0.474522116756	... and as president, I'm going to fight for the working men and women.
0.0	0.453252439034	I think it's a good product.
0.0	0.483297795749	And when the president of the United States gets out to speak about it, does he support police officers?
0.0	0.478970521426	Number two, we're going to enforce our immigration laws.
0.0	0.459190424544	... against Islam -- radical Islam -- if you're not for border security.
0.0	0.48375473332	It's all about getting people to listen to one another's problems.
0.0	0.493072067788	In terms of Saudi Arabia, look, my biggest problem with them is they're funding radical clerics through their madrasses.
0.0	0.470165182014	And I think this has become something that needs to be looked at in terms of regulation.
0.0	0.382050439696	But I was born here.
0.0	0.470468034451	... and sign an agreement that makes sure that the world knows that they will have technological superiority.
0.0	0.422221686909	That's how you solve the problem.
0.0	0.483669737522	We do that, this country would be safe and secure again not only from criminals but from the terrorist who threaten us as well.
0.0	0.491005536712	But out-of-pocket costs have gone up too much and prescription drug costs have gone through the roof.
0.0	0.46645590425	I believe we should be appointing Supreme Court justices who will follow the law and not try to make the law.
0.0	0.5	And if you make $40,000 a year, a family of four, you don't pay any income tax at all.
0.0	0.464279940691	You're not going to hear a lot of polished political speech from me, but you will hear the truth.
0.0	0.412311610125	Look what we did in Iran with Mosaddegh.
0.0	0.482682221124	Why do Americans contribute millions of dollars to charity?
0.0	0.460819863456	Yes, we must protect our borders.
0.0	0.526597510833	Why is it...
0.0	0.480878942642	We have to stop contributing to the creation of vacuums that allow safe havens to develop.
0.0	0.480504658663	We can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports gun control.
0.0	0.526597510833	That has not been...
0.0	0.427787736225	The facts are are very, very simple.
0.0	0.475083205438	Lawrence Tribe and (inaudible) from Harvard -- of Harvard, said that there is a serious question as to whether or not Ted can do this.
0.0	0.478558877917	You see, you have one side, the Democrats, and with immigration, all they care about is votes.
0.0	0.466804892217	Let me agree with much of what the secretary and the governor have said.
0.0	0.469066725451	Nobody would be tougher on ISIS than Donald Trump.
0.0	0.481950040829	I would say the message that got us the win in Iowa and 10 other states against pretty overwhelming odds, is the message that's going to deliver us in this election.
0.0	0.479411352084	... and 300,000 e-mails in my government record.
0.0	0.410368687322	And, PBS, thank you.
0.0	0.467255932427	I did a lot of great deals, and I did them early and young.
0.0	0.455952652242	And God only knows Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator.
0.0	0.489770033187	We used to have 16 workers for one retiree, now you have three workers for one retiree.
0.0	0.437269367579	And that's why we're in the trouble that we're in now.
0.0	0.482905989195	And listen, there are many, many wonderful, wonderful working men and women in the state of New York.
0.0	0.482229400358	And the reason for that is we've got to deal with the elephant in the room, which is the greed, recklessness and illegal behavior on Wall Street.
0.0	0.48662548979	We need leadership, someone who has a backbone and sticks with things, rather than just talks about them as though anything matters when you're talking about amendments that don't even actually are part of a bill that ever passed.
0.0	0.4748590236	America is best when we are actually standing up to evil in this world.
0.0	0.441377699319	But it's a lot safer.
0.0	0.472359601155	And I think that's an important point to make because I'm going through and analyzing the points you were making, Martha.
0.0	0.470337340987	While there are lots of good ideas for reform, we have never tackled the basics.
0.0	0.483159400079	... put us on firm ground, and has sent us into the future.
0.0	0.467306733586	And this is why you need to send someone from outside of Washington to Washington.
0.0	0.46982923396	Now, what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next.
0.0	0.5	Well, I believe that there are abuses, those companies should be permanently barred from ever using the program again and we should put strict standards in place to ensure that they're not being abused, like the prevailing wage requirement and like the advertising requirement.
0.0	0.427341423706	You can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.437178751459	We don't win.
0.0	0.387550410317	Yeah.
0.0	0.493761873102	In the crowd today is Major General James Livingston, who's the co-chairman of my campaign here in South Carolina, a Medal of Honor recipient.
0.0	0.46706477066	So there's more to my plan than just the cap.
0.0	0.463629787759	Look, the -- the deal is already done.
0.0	0.484061363242	And the spiraling out-of- control requires Puerto Rico to make structural reforms.
1.0	0.547299990521	He has called him a disappointment.
0.0	0.422207733101	How do I know this?
0.0	0.41655441657	We got it.
0.0	0.478437274533	...The only way we're going to be morale, the only way we're going to keep our promise to seniors is start by following the first rule we should all follow, which is to look at them, treat them like adults, and tell them the truth.
0.0	0.5	It is imposed on business and a critical piece that Marco seems to be missing is that this 16 percent business flat tax enables us to eliminate the corporate income tax.
0.0	0.5	The major priority, right now, in terms of our foreign and military policy should be the destruction of ISIS.
0.0	0.467016363039	We have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone.
0.0	0.447523044303	I think -- I'm not going to say that everybody is in agreement.
0.0	0.44845341055	This is a bad deal.
0.0	0.459294155458	So I believe as president I will look very carefully about unintended consequences.
0.0	0.453857284686	Wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.458348413492	Do people not care about all of our sacrifice?
0.0	0.5	Please do not tell me that in this country, if -- and here's the if -- we have the courage to take on the drug companies, and have the courage to take on the insurance companies, and the medical equipment suppliers, if we do that, yes, we can guarantee health care to all people in a much more cost effective way.
0.0	0.460762140519	I think it's important we put this in historic context.
0.0	0.474249385986	This is about the bigger, broader war against ISIS.
0.0	0.455095878057	That's just media stuff.
0.0	0.489368259847	Last time I was elected governor, won a record margin in my state.
0.0	0.467584538672	I'm not running against Governor Bush, I'm not running against anyone on this stage.
0.0	0.484966696268	I met young people who are desperately trying to get clean and have nowhere to go, because there are not enough facilities.
0.0	0.461748828702	So we have to rebuild our infrastructure, our bridges, our roadways, our airports.
1.0	0.623019173015	I lost that election by three percentage points.
0.0	0.482019792723	We need to focus our energies there, not these broad, blanket, kind of statements that will make it harder for us to deal with ISIS.
0.0	0.458487819191	That will change everything.
0.0	0.44510791991	Listen, I want to just comment.
0.0	0.468304349761	And we can get a lot of them out if we get the government out of our lives.
0.0	0.476383506944	We went after companies that were doing things that were against the law.
0.0	0.452126684635	Maria, Neil, thank you for a great debate tonight.
0.0	0.492714353753	Now, it is true that there are a bunch of lobbyists, and a bunch of Democrats in this state spending millions of dollars trying to convince the people of Iowa that I somehow oppose ethanol.
0.0	0.482127459521	I'm very clear that we have a distinct difference between those of us on this stage tonight and all of our Republican counterparts.
0.0	0.451089239179	Didn't just happen.
0.0	0.463163289772	I'd like to take a matter of personal privilege here...
0.0	0.465249196433	So, let's stop fooling around about this, let's tell people the truth.
0.0	0.480841106553	You did support a U.N. Security Council approach, which we did follow up on.
0.0	0.470969944972	I think, you know, Rand and I have some significant issues on policy, but I respect Rand.
0.0	0.5	Half of American seniors would be in poverty without a Social Security check.
0.0	0.443780088045	Our vets are being treated horribly.
0.0	0.475887507307	And the fact is that we need a commander-in- chief who not only understands how to protect us, but feels in here what it means to face the possibility of loss.
0.0	0.451835203298	Somebody says "I'm a fighter."
0.0	0.5	I have a proven record of success, 32 years in business, and 8 years as Governor of the state of Florida.
0.0	0.467024481147	The answer is that all of the Mexicans, they're criminals and rapists, we've got to hate the Mexicans.
0.0	0.445381537235	I am a conservative because I know our values, our principles and our policies --
0.0	0.454654850912	I mean, that's a fact.
0.0	0.47253629432	We're nowhere close to a balanced budget or fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.458598482902	Or would you rather take less later on?
0.0	0.485285647418	These are often very long- term kinds of investments that have to be made.
0.0	0.5	And it's because of the flip-flopping, political approach of Washington that both of my two colleagues on this stage have represented there for the last forty years.
0.0	0.422207733101	We know...
0.0	0.484962363068	No, I oppose it because you're taking money from the entitlement and then spending it immediately on other items.
0.0	0.468034704218	... that's what you say in a primary.
0.0	0.464284789558	The truth is I had to make some tough calls in some tough times.
0.0	0.490470113204	You see, all of my career, I've fought about giving voice to the people that I grew up with and voice to the people that elected me.
0.0	0.474952678073	We have a huge mental health problem in this country.
0.0	0.42068119917	I am telling the truth.
0.0	0.475050128922	We're going to bring jobs and manufacturing back.
0.0	0.416838253845	Let me...
0.0	0.462115247571	Our enduring symbol is not the barbed wire fence, it is the Statue of Liberty.
0.0	0.42997938767	And before I say it, I have to say this.
0.0	0.42182663972	I don't want it."
0.0	0.455746609724	And I say that to Nikki.
0.0	0.5	I've seen so much of it - a Soviet Union, the coming down of a wall, the issues that we saw around the world in Central America, the potential spread of communism, and 9/11 and Gulf War.
1.0	0.592569622488	Secretary Clinton changes her position on this every election year, it seems, having one position in 2000 and then campaigning against President Obama and saying we don't need federal standards.
0.0	0.488231189898	You find a Democrat that's for cutting taxes -- cutting spending ten dollars, I'll give them a warm kiss.
0.0	0.488841981562	And I'll tell you, Bret, I think that's a much more attractive vision for healthcare than the Washington-drive, top-down Obamacare that is causing so many millions of people to hurt.
0.0	0.490917442841	And she is just one or two more poll drops down from even moving further left than she's moved already to get to the left of Bernie on this.
0.0	0.442871280399	There are no simple solutions.
0.0	0.450844898133	I've got five grandkids.
0.0	0.422041909837	We can't do this unilaterally.
0.0	0.471391739074	As president, I would make the administrator of USAID an actual cabinet member.
0.0	0.464421495603	It's like a 400 pound man saying, "I'm going to go on a diet, but I'm eating a sack of Krispy Kremes before I do."
0.0	0.491207557285	My proposal is tougher, more effective, and more comprehensive because I go after all of Wall Street not just the big banks.
0.0	0.492801000472	... and here's the critical point, Maria -- the business flat tax enables us to abolish the corporate income tax, the death tax, the Obamacare taxes, the payroll taxes, and they're border-adjustable, so every export pays no taxes whatsoever.
0.0	0.493605369919	And anyone who lies to the families of Americans who have died in the service of this country can never be commander-in-chief of the United States.
1.0	0.604413101447	I vetoed a statewide I.D. system for gun owners and I pardoned, six out-of-state folks who came through our state and were arrested for owning a gun legally in another state so they never have to face charges.
0.0	0.493787758451	And he led the charge to finally fix this immigration problem that has existed now for, as Marco says, for 30 years.
0.0	0.453193336443	I get to respond, right?
0.0	0.5	I believe that when we have some 300 million guns in this country, I believe that when we have seen these horrific mass killings, not only in San Bernardino, but in Colorado and movie theaters in Colorado, I think we have got to bring together the vast majority of the people who do in fact believe in sensible gun safety regulations.
0.0	0.457955935592	And that's why we must make sure we continue to frack.
0.0	0.476934910541	But if I get elected president I will bring it back bigger and better and stronger than ever before, and we will make America great again.
0.0	0.481196844676	If I'm our nominee, I will unite this party and we'll defeat Hillary Clinton and we will turn this country around once and for all, after seven years of the disaster that is Barack Obama.
0.0	0.464471056011	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.457618786014	We're seeing it in my state and we'll see it in this country.
0.0	0.454933122968	You know, I think abortion is always wrong.
0.0	0.451102287733	They're going to build in Mexico.
0.0	0.457110638721	We need money.
0.0	0.467891912033	Since I was attacked too.
0.0	0.526597510833	How do we do it?"
0.0	0.5	You know, I was a senator from New York after 9/11, and we spent countless hours trying to figure out how to protect the city and the state from perhaps additional attacks.
0.0	0.407393064676	You do legislation.
0.0	0.526597510833	Why?
0.0	0.5	And second, the First Amendment Defense Act, which is protecting religious liberty, if it's not passed by then, which I suspect it won't, because the president will veto it, I will institute an executive order to make sure that people of faith are not being -- not being harassed and persecuted by the federal government for standing up for the religious beliefs.
0.0	0.433083484393	Hillary Rodham Clinton did that to our country.
1.0	0.50684626864	1.5 million jobs created during the worst economic time this country has had since the Great Depression while the rest of the country lost 400,000 jobs.
0.0	0.488671738338	That now includes the internet, because we have seen that ISIS is a very effective recruiter, propagandist and inciter and celebrator of violence.
0.0	0.479791806529	Judy, if I can, there is no question, Secretary Clinton and I are friends, and I have a lot of respect for her, that she has enormous experience in foreign affairs.
0.0	0.481448607661	We have to provide the NATO support to back up the mission that is going on.
0.0	0.435075310882	If not, they can stay where they are.
0.0	0.484141862752	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.471163445514	And in that interview, he explained his views on a whole host of issues that were very, very different from the views he's describing now.
0.0	0.463275202193	This election has to be about reversing all of that damage.
0.0	0.401901202335	OK?
0.0	0.4804873436	And if you elect me president, we will bring incredible growth back to this country.
0.0	0.48356379696	Their kids come out of college, they have high debt and they can't get a good job.
0.0	0.47377876137	If you've got 10 people coming to your house and you know one of them is a terrorist, you're probably going to keep them all out.
0.0	0.471763088797	This is not some small scale group.
0.0	0.475209989893	Here, we actually need 1,000 because we have natural barriers.
0.0	0.480676590826	Barack Obama believes that America is a arrogant global power that needs to be cut down to size.
0.0	0.47977079235	We can make a stronger program.
0.0	0.443029974919	Progressives don't believe that.
0.0	0.422301430922	Yes.
0.0	0.486322576496	Because that person should not have gotten a gun, should not -- would not have passed a background check.
0.0	0.462392178675	I will put a price tag.
1.0	0.49262837965	And they're tired of spending more money on education than any nation in the world per capita, than any nation in the world, and we are 26th in the world, 25 countries are better than us in education.
0.0	0.432870479309	I think it's -- yeah, I think it's a one-two punch.
0.0	0.494429426763	Folks, the government has no business stealing even more from the people who have paid this in.
0.0	0.486081578283	And when it comes to the issues that are really on the front lines as to whether we're going to have equal pay, paid family leave, some opportunity for, you know, women to go as far as their hard work and talent take them, I think that we still have some barriers to knock down, which is why that's at the core of my campaign.
0.0	0.485952543246	It's the only way to level the playing field between big and powerful and small and powerless.
0.0	0.5	I'm the only person on this stage that actually was involved in the chief architect of balancing the Federal Budget.
0.0	0.486666499908	They attacked us in Philadelphia last week.
0.0	0.479270966699	But we allowed people to keep health care.
0.0	0.487211006286	This isn't just the country I was born in, this is the nation that literally changed the history of my family.
0.0	0.462856224724	You see, folks, this is how socialism starts.
0.0	0.479319170327	Bill after coming home from Japan, flying 33 missions.
0.0	0.488524597799	I'm the only one on this stage that has a plan that would create jobs, cut taxes, balance the budget and can get it done because I'm realistic.
0.0	0.491570336699	What kind of signal does that send to the rest of the world that the United States is a serious player in creating peace and security?
0.0	0.43407227982	But we don't know.
0.0	0.475135793653	I brought people together over some very deep racial divides.
0.0	0.492278304517	Probably in terms of the applying for the job of president, a weakness would be not really seeing myself in that position until hundreds of thousands of people began to tell me that I needed to do it.
0.0	0.47942294605	And of course, it has to be de-conflicted with the Russians, who are also flying in that space.
0.0	0.487736302581	And under the laws of this country, he wasn't allowed to be with his father for seven years.
0.0	0.387472370888	She was a great CEO.
0.0	0.483476458984	We have to act in a much more whole of government approach, as General Dempsey said.
0.0	0.483111365836	And I would -- first of all, face him down in that whole region, the whole Baltic region.
0.0	0.466084881027	And when you do that, you will be amazed at how much progress you can make, and how much healing we can have.
0.0	0.442985943005	...Then I'll buy you a tequila...
0.0	0.526597510833	...
0.0	0.486323208276	They're building a military island in the middle of the South China sea.
1.0	0.605181334247	There aren't enough good-paying jobs, especially for young people.
0.0	0.481684617894	We saw a Muslim brotherhood president installed, and then we saw him ousted and the army back.
0.0	0.487074848798	What the polls are showing is that we are actually defeating the secretary among younger people.
0.0	0.456296936934	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.5	My proposal is to put a speculation tax on wall street, raise very substantial sums of money, not only make public colleges and universities tuition-free, but also substantially lower interest rates on student debt.
0.0	0.386124609134	They can't.
0.0	0.445269993259	These are very, very real issues.
0.0	0.467613933023	And at the end of the day, it was the president's decision.
0.0	0.5	I mean, what we had was something the government made -- basically a bag of gas -- that cut loose, destroyed everything in its path, left thousands of people powerless, but they couldn't get rid of it because we had too much money invested in it, so we had to keep it.
0.0	0.426665094495	He's an entertaining guy.
0.0	0.431162841084	They will -- some will follow.
0.0	0.5	Twenty-four months ago, 36 months ago, you did not have a group of radical crazies named ISIS who were burning people in cages and recruiting people to enter our country legally.
0.0	0.438320312323	Let's hope that it holds.
0.0	0.460616572828	Let me hear if there's any difference between the Secretary and myself.
0.0	0.47238018896	Senator Cruz, I'd like to respond...
0.0	0.479261081269	And if you can't use the term, you're never going to solve the problem.
0.0	0.4530358065	It is absolutely absurd to say that I had any kind of a relationship with them.
0.0	0.460385865341	He is undermining our standing in the world.

0.0	0.526597510833	What should we do?
0.0	0.481400546613	So if we're going to be talking like this, we can -- and maybe we can score some political points -- but the fact is: Every one of us stands for the kind of economy that will work better for every American.
0.0	0.5	Never have and never will support any effort to grant blanket legalization amnesty to folks who have entered, or stayed in this country illegally.
0.0	0.466228604846	You can call it visas, you can call it work permits, you can call it anything you want.
0.0	0.420978161633	But this is what I do believe.
0.0	0.494287623553	I know that he has said in the two previous that he wants to take on this immunity issue because we need to send a strong message to the gun manufacturers, to the sellers, to the gun lobby.
0.0	0.482474204486	But the idea that you can't -- that you're just gonna grow your way out of this -- I have a plan to grow the economy at 4 percent, but you're gonna have to make adjustments for both Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.48558684227	You know, as I said already twice in this debate, we have a very serious problem in this country.
1.0	0.481929759244	2,300 sophisticated vehicles, they ran, and the enemy took them.
0.0	0.489922284879	Government trying to level the playing field between Internet and brick-and-mortar creates a problem.
0.0	0.444677000881	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.475057012441	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.484977398823	And by the way, the police are the most mistreated people in this country.
0.0	0.429898753981	All right.
0.0	0.466328557561	Well, Gwen and Judy, thank you very much for hosting this event.
0.0	0.473904304659	Everybody ought to have a chance to be able to rise to their God-given purpose.
0.0	0.451954607576	Folks, we've got to wake up.
0.0	0.526597510833	But...
0.0	0.450360744601	Let's do more -- let's do more than reverse the immunity.
0.0	0.474391145132	Last point.
0.0	0.420978161633	Believe me.
0.0	0.475493946963	Well, this is what I would say, and the Congressman was right.
0.0	0.414713650196	You find me...
0.0	0.477888437497	They come from another country and they're immediately sent out.
0.0	0.446410500627	We need to stop that.
0.0	0.463293977609	And I'll tell you, I'm not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump.
0.0	0.5	It shifts it to the business, and it would allow middle class people to get a tax cut.
0.0	0.5	Seventeen more million more people have health care.
0.0	0.462239786665	I do not believe in unilateral American action.
0.0	0.526597510833	So what do we do?
0.0	0.473535183708	I know personally how extraordinary and unique this nation is.
0.0	0.477158770737	As president of the United States, I will be a commander in chief that will have the back of the military.
1.0	0.615491647487	And then we decided we could bring $14 billion of our money -- I mean, Washington doesn't have any money.
0.0	0.39847947423	Absolutely.
0.0	0.466512723963	This isn't free money.
0.0	0.48108880647	We need to take a new approach of taxing -- reforming how we tax, and reforming the regulations in our -- in our country before it's too late.
0.0	0.453349363251	Got to be on the floor of the Senate.
0.0	0.477851685138	But without the tools, without the support that was needed to that.
0.0	0.458469452119	Have you ever disagreed with a president?
0.0	0.473096898845	For a start, the secretary and I disagree -- and I think the president does not agree with her -- in terms of the concept of a no-fly zone in Syria.
0.0	0.473802588708	And I'll go back to something that had been mentioned just a few minutes ago.
0.0	0.466246615824	He made a deal with Chuck Schumer that he would oppose any conservative amendments.
0.0	0.476896361358	We can't afford another four years of that.
0.0	0.451814993037	And I don't think you have to be a politician to tell the truth.
0.0	0.403731560681	And, thank you everybody.
0.0	0.485185026343	23 million files in the hands of the Chinese?
0.0	0.486491703993	I'm glad he has produced enormous enthusiasm, and, every Donald Trump voter or potential voter, I hope to earn your support.
0.0	0.474180218897	I'm running for president, because as I go around this nation, I talk to a lot of people.
0.0	0.47670036169	And now they are beating us economically.
0.0	0.471176911033	Because, I've got to tell you the truth, even in New Jersey what you're doing is called rude.
0.0	0.473090729969	Secondly, a policy on recruiting and hiring, and then more resources for -- for training.
0.0	0.481816177323	I stood yesterday with 75 construction workers.
0.0	0.470323524488	We're going to have too many people in the cart rather than pulling the cart.
0.0	0.466150310926	And they're looking around them, and they're looking at Washington, and they're saying the rich are getting much richer, I'm getting poorer, what are you going to do about it?
0.0	0.461079920642	We need to re-establish the relationships with the Sunnis.
0.0	0.494589627167	Real inflation accounted for wages has declined precipitously over the years.
0.0	0.49265226914	The first speech I gave in this campaign back in April was about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration.
0.0	0.419060854775	That's not true.
0.0	0.408191633055	That is the issue.
0.0	0.451484333538	No, I didn't care (inaudible).
0.0	0.470215033574	First of all, yes, we've stolen.
0.0	0.424146437622	Everybody knows that.
0.0	0.466980660329	It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are.
0.0	0.47746565941	You know, these plans would put us trillions and trillions of dollars in debt.
0.0	0.422889465113	Thank you very much.
1.0	0.483099930587	When was the last time you saw a Chevrolet in Tokyo? It doesn't exist, folks.
0.0	0.479664862827	They are anxious about international terrorism and the possibility of another attack on America.
0.0	0.415232986698	What about hydroelectric power?
0.0	0.492658946241	13 Hours -- tomorrow morning, a new movie will debut about the incredible bravery of the men fighting for their lives in Benghazi and the politicians that abandoned them.
0.0	0.427154625653	I think any parent would be so proud of them.
0.0	0.48083114136	And then we saw that the leading candidates for president at the time, both the Republican and the Democrats, all supported it.
0.0	0.479584496272	On two occasions, there were breeches in information two months ago.
0.0	0.453413356526	So was Ted, but now he says it wasn't so.
0.0	0.48097994597	You blindfold the American people so that they cannot see the true cost of government.
0.0	0.447815288844	And not only did I fight them, but I beat them.
0.0	0.43700306739	Look at my family.
0.0	0.439406425684	Bottom line.
0.0	0.5	And based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don't add up, and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now.
0.0	0.448668552421	I want to thank the people of Iowa for being so welcoming to me.
0.0	0.468567693854	And secondly, when you talk about me being on the board of Lehman Brothers, I wasn't on the board of Lehman Brothers.
0.0	0.429898753981	Right.
0.0	0.493650928964	And that is why I am pledged, if elected president of the United States, to bring about a political revolution where millions of people begin to stand up and finally say enough is enough, this great country and our government belong to all of us, not just a handful of billionaires.
0.0	0.456566552434	Nobody can do that like me.
0.0	0.481410455706	You know, the Security Council finally got around to adopting a resolution.
1.0	0.563996013258	Today, we have 272.
1.0	0.5	Every car and every truck and every part manufactured in this plant that comes across the border, we're going to charge you a 35-percent tax, and that tax is going to be paid simultaneously with the transaction, and that's it.
0.0	0.477906030375	And you've seen a little bit of this emerging in the -- in the African Union and the things that they have done to better stabilize Somalia.
0.0	0.398119948329	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.470441176871	Yeah, I would go, first of all, one step further in this description of Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.484744802477	The most powerful intelligence agency in the world is going to tell us where we are, the most powerful military in the world is going to destroy them.
0.0	0.442767783577	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.462880914706	If you want someone to grab a beer with, I may not be that guy.
0.0	0.468041539123	But states need to do more as well.
0.0	0.452859313326	I frankly don't think there will be much change because I think what's going to happen is you're going to get more of the same.
0.0	0.462316113311	Neil, my name was mentioned as well.
0.0	0.486312245621	The insurance companies, the drug companies are bribing the United States Congress.
0.0	0.409578648013	They have no choice.
0.0	0.449439887945	Now, it's very interesting.
0.0	0.494349817711	And that means when police officers out in a community do illegal activity -- kill people who are unarmed who should not be killed, they must be held accountable.
0.0	0.462621433008	Of course you are right.
0.0	0.422301430922	Yes.
0.0	0.401278682004	And he'll say, "Please, please, please."
0.0	0.471016834127	They have affiliates in over a dozen countries now.
0.0	0.490403291711	Companies should, if they want to attract the best workers, provide a good set of benefits.
0.0	0.438676943344	Enough on fantasy football.
1.0	0.581670569817	This president is undermining our military.
0.0	0.475160950497	You know, it is difficult finding intelligence that is actionable in a lot of these places, but we have to keep trying.
0.0	0.411264823951	I think you're --
0.0	0.5	He launched Fast and Furious, illegally selling guns to Mexican drug lords that were then used to shoot law enforcement officials.
0.0	0.494639206034	They make a billion dollars a day.
0.0	0.468804190238	You know, John Adams famously said, "facts are are stubborn things."
0.0	0.486265640097	It has to be with our friends in the Arab world and our friends in Europe, the coalition that we had when we went to the first Gulf War.
1.0	0.5	Six million more people living in poverty than the day that Barack Obama got elected president, and the left just wants more of the same.
0.0	0.376639499728	She was naturalized.
0.0	0.452316713461	Take it to the bank.
0.0	0.430451667987	I am passionate about what I believe.
0.0	0.464774285798	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.401147044455	That's crony capitalism.
0.0	0.482334644733	You have regulations -- I mean, come on, they're affecting everybody here, particularly our small businesses.
0.0	0.452121011467	You can -- if you -- you flew in with your 767, didn't you?
0.0	0.479926042047	So they soybean sales from Iowa, entire soybean production goes -- the equivalent of it goes to China.
0.0	0.478908960594	No, it is not throwing -- it is an extraordinary investment for this country.
0.0	0.485060901685	And by the way, as important as those two phone calls are, they are also very important because they say this.
0.0	0.441730470388	It never happens.
0.0	0.491099675536	And, look, I think it's important to look at what the most important counterterrorism judgment of the first four years of the Obama administration was, and that was the very difficult decision as to whether or not to advise the president to go after bin Laden.
0.0	0.360143435691	...Chris...
0.0	0.487537455259	The Iranians getting more of a presence in Syria, linking with Hezbollah, their proxy in Lebanon, would threaten Israel and would make it more difficult for us to move on a path to have a transition that at some point would deal with Assad's future.
0.0	0.483647049943	Good company.... one of the early things I would do, probably before I even got in -- and I wouldn't even use -- you know, I have -- I know the smartest negotiators in the world.
0.0	0.47374965433	I will change the culture in Washington, just as I changed the culture in Tallahassee.
0.0	0.485793363285	No, I said, " I would use -- " they were asking me what to do about North Korea.
0.0	0.459272704528	And I just couldn't agree -- disagree more with those kinds of comments.
0.0	0.478272847926	I am convinced that this president, if he could get rid of the Second Amendment, he would.
0.0	0.488035465806	I believe capital gains, for the most part, should be taxed the same way we tax income from hard work, sweat, and toil.
0.0	0.484829396794	I think it's a mistake to create new and more expensive entitlement programs when we can't afford the ones we've got today.
0.0	0.447983085545	Marco, Marco -- he brought up my name.
0.0	0.471310792878	And you talk so much that nobody can ever keep up with what you're saying is accurate or not.
0.0	0.436295783104	...eliminates the business...
0.0	0.450472803927	And you're not serious about destroying ISIL.
0.0	0.450851917831	We can build the fence.
0.0	0.473772525902	It costs me $3.
0.0	0.452019250793	Neil, my name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.468883200568	And when I'm president, we are going to bring it under control once and for all after 30 years of talking about it.
0.0	0.412868148225	Think about it.
0.0	0.46365587928	And we're letting them get away with it and we can't let them get away with it.
0.0	0.473943145492	And we're going to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	0.441563336711	I can promise you.
0.0	0.470425001211	You know, I've never really brought this up unless asked the question, but I have responded to the question.
0.0	0.489187773254	But everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro- gay-marriage, focus around money and the media.
0.0	0.47582299656	That's basically bordering on a miracle because of our great prison director.
0.0	0.483618640389	I think America is just a few good decisions and a leadership change at the top away from the best years we've ever had.
0.0	0.469993434871	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.494281652152	Why not go to Congress and in a bipartisan way, begin to deal with the process of mental health issues so that people that are spiraling out of control because of mental health challenges don't have access to guns.
0.0	0.493672395045	Because I don't think we should be imposing new big programs that are going to raise middle class families' taxes.
0.0	0.455435912253	... first of all...
0.0	0.413659557424	We had Hamas.
0.0	0.451237938079	It certainly does cover it.
0.0	0.475094703075	That's right, three pages.
0.0	0.485227502795	I will, with your help and support, lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.430823640852	Well, I respectfully disagree.
0.0	0.466280469293	The simple fact is that the world has been torn asunder.
0.0	0.476033803745	People are waking up because it is going to be us who will determine the direction of our country.
0.0	0.474501710673	If we do not know who you are, and we do not know why you are coming when I am president, you are not getting into the United States of America.
0.0	0.409452996804	Both served.
0.0	0.481010486104	You have to ban the people who are trying to hurt us.
0.0	0.450746217104	But most importantly, when you look at what happened in the 1990s, go to berniesanders.com.
0.0	0.474848124688	Our role in the world is not to roam the globe looking for new dictators to topple.
0.0	0.477319540646	We have got to destroy their training camps over there before they can attack us here.
0.0	0.442549370745	Well I want to comment on this.
0.0	0.461639878169	It can not be someone that agrees with his agenda.
0.0	0.482489922499	That means pass the Paycheck Fairness Act so we have transparency about how much people are making.
0.0	0.486158084023	And that's why I've been clear, when I am the president of the United States of America, we don't know who you are, and we don't know why you're trying to come to the United States, you are not going to get in, because the radical threat that we now face from ISIS is extraordinary and unprecedented...
0.0	0.478572242258	ISIL is trying to create themselves into a new state.
0.0	0.430969746542	I'm going to do it for America.
0.0	0.463822878845	Well, I would just repeat that.
0.0	0.475149461479	And that's what I hear from some people, "we'll do nothing and it will just be fixed."
0.0	0.483214214888	You don't have seven children and bring them into this world if you're not optimistic about the future of this country.
0.0	0.459107476053	Let me just say this.
0.0	0.471468951402	Now we're having smaller families.
0.0	0.476458741784	They understand the vulnerabilities we have on the southern border.
0.0	0.454789085781	We will win on everything we do.
0.0	0.471150325773	This group needs to be confronted and defeated.
0.0	0.452379936382	Let's talk about our campaigns.
0.0	0.484318865903	We will finish the 700 miles of fencing and walls our nation needs.
0.0	0.494516852753	Drug use is about equal between white and black, but our prisons -- three out of four people in prison are black or brown.
0.0	0.48557102368	Because we can't just save the American Dream, we can expand it to reach more people, and change more lives than ever before.
0.0	0.482107071339	I ask for your support to build, together, a safer and stronger America.
0.0	0.466608976458	I think she said something like the bulk of the responsibility is not ours.
0.0	0.392032249983	I was not that candidate.
0.0	0.42168994827	As a Catholic, that's what I want to do.
0.0	0.506857389619	When CEO income has risen 90 percent above the average worker, when the bottom 90 percent of this country's economy has had stagnant wages for the past 40 years, somebody is taking it in the teeth.
0.0	0.464252925647	People that know me, like me.
0.0	0.375258129606	(APPLAUSE)
0.0	0.44930762002	I want security.
0.0	0.456486852504	And a lot of people are doing that.
0.0	0.441942479334	That is not what America is supposed to be about.
0.0	0.5	When I was running for senate just about every lobbyist, just about all of the establishment opposed me in the senate race in Texas and my opponent in that race was worth over 200 million dollars.
0.0	0.486508439033	We are not going to round up and deport 12 million people, but we're not going to hand out citizenship cards, either.
0.0	0.404613733076	They're protectionist.
0.0	0.487191989442	Eradicate those and you fix Medicare and you've fixed America, its economy and you've made people's lives a heck of a lot better.
0.0	0.446303398396	It was a terrible sight.
0.0	0.438553655659	I've done it.
0.0	0.470115183384	I've got the scars to show from the effort back in the early '90s.
0.0	0.456576983964	It has not been in effect during the administration of Barack Obama.
0.0	0.451072398555	Let me just -- let me just...
1.0	0.591568472595	Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan.
0.0	0.482602484458	In fact, after it happened, the president called my husband -- he called all the former presidents and he said to Bill, "Well I assume Hillary has told you about this."
0.0	0.480540125601	Iran sanctions -- the Iran sanctions that brought them to the table, those are sanctions that we put in place when I was in the United States Senate, and a whole host of other things that put me in a position of saying, I not only have a great vision, but I can govern effectively in Washington.
0.0	0.48858859447	It is insane to my mind, hundreds of thousands of young people today, bright qualified people, cannot go to college because they cannot afford -- their families cannot afford to send them.
0.0	0.461287769222	In fact, he's done worse than nothing.
0.0	0.419973827726	That's 13,000 miles.
0.0	0.462639235824	Meanwhile, the rich get richer.
0.0	0.401901202335	OK.
0.0	0.481283918056	We can create a situation where wages begin to rise.
0.0	0.473415336814	We cannot be the world's policeman.
0.0	0.484316719359	But we will only do so if we hold true to the values and the freedoms that unite us, which means we must never surrender them to terrorists, must never surrender our Americans values to racist, must never surrender to the fascist pleas of billionaires with big mouths.

0.0	0.492979027585	Tonight we have a different debate than the debates that we have been allowed to have so far, because tonight is different because of this reason, that in the course of this presidential campaign America has again been attacked by jihadi terrorists, American lives taken from us.

0.0	0.435124431479	You don't have to say that.
0.0	0.475614240156	Look, here's the deal, in this particular case, the FBI made a mistake.

0.0	0.479271205386	And Mexico's going to pay for the wall because Mexico -- I love the Mexican people; I respect the Mexican leaders -- but the leaders are much sharper, smarter and more cunning than our leaders.
0.0	0.419049626901	It was terrible.
0.0	0.488811907347	They know that this country is pushing the middle class, the hardworking taxpayers, backwards, and they saw a president who doesn't understand their pain, and doesn't have any plan for getting away from it.
0.0	0.479349963057	I've had more calls on that statement that Ted made -- New York is a great place.
0.0	0.484358218582	The time has come to stop ignoring the mentally ill in this country and begin to treat them and get them on their feet, along with, of course, with treating the drug-addicted.

0.0	0.373838660474	They didn't do that.
0.0	0.485876811301	And if you're going to leave this to Hillary Clinton, the person who gave us this foreign policy, the architect of it, and you're going to give her another four years, that's why I'm speaking out as strongly as I am about that.
0.0	0.455983132809	We have to put more money.
0.0	0.455618786629	And in fact I would go further.

0.0	0.366256784459	You do the arithmetic.
0.0	0.475541681042	And that's why we have to use Carl (ph) and we have to use our great businesspeople and not political hacks to negotiate with these guys.
0.0	0.48205994344	That is very different than talking about specific action for regime change, which I did not support.
0.0	0.481184386761	Nobody wants to watch three and a half, or three hours.

0.0	0.467495415136	It is an agenda, in my view, that would do great harm to our country.
0.0	0.469290916717	It had missed, before I had arrived, expectations for nine quarters in a row.
0.0	0.490299251279	I'm running for president to knock down all the barriers that are holding Americans back, and to rebuild the ladders of opportunity that will give every American a chance to advance, especially those who have been left out and left behind.

1.0	0.605731863835	They don't want to pay 35 percent tax on the way back.
1.0	0.562286414932	Well, there's not question that we should be able to look at past president whether they're married to somebody who's running for president or not in terms of their past behavior and what it means.
0.0	0.468413969356	We will work with our Sunni allies.

0.0	0.44975770102	We offered a lot more.
0.0	0.449059509746	But that's not an accurate description of the plan.

0.0	0.480672187183	John, I had the honor of being chairman of the U.S. Senate committee on Veterans' Affairs for two years.
0.0	0.489500932243	I don't think anybody has cut that much government anywhere, at any time.
0.0	0.487377001216	So, yes, we must talk about our ideas to move our economy forward, but the first job of the president of the United States is to protect the people of the United States.
0.0	0.488049820272	Where did it ever say in the Constitution, where is it written that it's the job of the United States of America or its secretary of State to determine when dictators have to go?

0.0	0.466080110226	And the fact is this is what makes a difference when you're a governor.
1.0	0.599384067135	Gun people said, there were three candidates in the race, you vote for one of the others, but not Bernie Sanders.
0.0	0.492405765429	We ought to be helping in terms of the technology for fracking, keeping the price low, quite frankly, because that's what's keeping him contained.

0.0	0.45485133121	They always keep our equipment.
0.0	0.484694023123	I don't think the United States should be engaged in symbolic military activity.

0.0	0.450054111902	But people have to be alert.
0.0	0.421104430973	I'm the only person...
0.0	0.442767783577	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.48978036973	Wall Street today has too much political power.
0.0	0.447853891692	You should stick with it and that's exactly what happened.

0.0	0.382859102389	That's what they're doing.
0.0	0.486555158789	We need someone with a steady hand being president of the United States.
0.0	0.493630023898	Well, first of all, I didn't say that the rate would be 10 percent.
0.0	0.452035750786	O' Malley: John, please, it's-- personal privilege, John.
0.0	0.478367929011	But like all of our problems, there isn't a single one that can't be solved with common sense if you remove the ego and the politics.
0.0	0.46908421733	They say, " well, we don't really have control."
0.0	0.49396919347	I have introduced legislation that would phase out the ethanol mandate over five years, but that is in the context of having no mandates whatsoever for anyone.
0.0	0.5	Last week in a CNN town hall, the Senator told a questioner that the questioner would spend about $500 dollars in taxes to get about $5,000 dollars in healthcare.
0.0	0.469428700904	Because I think we have to get to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.47612965723	And, when I hear people talking about means testing, let's just remember what that means.
1.0	0.488114688167	We get a no-good traitor, and they get the five people that they wanted for years, and those people are now back on the battlefield trying to kill us.
0.0	0.489719057048	One of the problems we have had -- I think all Americans understand this, is whether it's Republican administrations or Democratic administrations, we have seen Wall Street and Goldman Sachs dominate administrations.
0.0	0.456818557393	I have a feeling it's going to work out, actually.
0.0	0.478041245647	Two weeks later, the place was blown up.
0.0	0.493907779565	And that's the reason that I've said under my presidency, we'll create jobs and make American the number one manufacturing country in the world.
0.0	0.5	Number one, we have to create better paying jobs.
0.0	0.484951418926	Your proposal is to go and send the health care system to the state.
0.0	0.457166139116	I don't think she's responsible for his behavior.
0.0	0.398601724604	And it has been amazing to me.
0.0	0.492651658196	We need to be very well aware of the fact that China and Russia are using technology to attack us, just as ISIS is using technology to recruit those who would murder American citizens.
0.0	0.5	Barack Obama right now, number one, over seven years, has dramatically degraded our military.
0.0	0.5	And what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice.
0.0	0.422301430922	Yes.
0.0	0.485854929236	For over 200 years, America's light has been shining on the world and the world has never been the same again.
0.0	0.466737584149	It's time for real substance and real experience.
0.0	0.471896147885	That's because we've put conservative policies in place.
0.0	0.479884836948	We're going to bring jobs back from Japan, we're going to bring jobs back from China, we're going to bring, frankly, jobs back from Mexico where, as you probably saw, Nabisco is leaving Chicago with one of their biggest plants, and they're moving it to Mexico.
1.0	0.478578845219	The bad news is, we have 470,000 going out of business every year.
0.0	0.470591970888	But he used to say, "Donald, don't go into Manhattan.
0.0	0.487102949766	Fred Thompson was the other one, a man who had spent a lot of time on that screen.
0.0	0.472077617492	America is back in the leadership business.
0.0	0.447410689769	When did we beat Japan at anything?
0.0	0.5	There is no question in my mind that if we summon our resources, both our leadership resources and all of the tools at our disposal, not just military force, which should be used as a last resort, but our diplomacy, our development aid, law enforcement, sharing of intelligence in a much more open and cooperative way -- that we can bring people together.
0.0	0.454093818867	We talked about criminal justice reform.
0.0	0.471854115795	We need somebody that can take the brand of the United States and make it great again.
0.0	0.46380781119	It's what I've done or not done, or it's war.

0.0	0.484597088184	We need to break the Washington cartel, and the only way to do it is to end all the subsidies and all...
0.0	0.472821604576	I do not see -- want to see one parent or loved one worrying about getting a call in the middle of the night.
0.0	0.5	Number two, I want Medicare to be able to negotiate for lower drug prices just like they negotiate with other countries' health systems.
0.0	0.481300837548	But we need to leave the Cold War and that sort of antiquated thinking behind.
0.0	0.456644864255	He cut and run.
0.0	0.480875269415	Because what she will do is come in and she will raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.480547653479	Everytime they got a paycheck, the government reached in and took something out of it before they ever saw it.
0.0	0.493181730603	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.476926957869	But I want to say a quick word about what Senator Sanders and then Governor O'Malley said.
0.0	0.469101148576	We're going to suspend -- I've -- I've said this for four years.
0.0	0.440443129919	There will be a process.
0.0	0.491165344997	And he did so because taking citizenship off the table was important, and it revealed the hypocrisy of the proponents of this bill, who were looking for votes.
0.0	0.484614826457	We have to protect our 2nd amendment and you cannot do this and certainly what Barack Obama was doing with the executive order.
0.0	0.462954194724	He invoked mine as well.
0.0	0.494937726683	Because we work with the private sector to make solar energy affordable and available to businesses and individuals in our state.
0.0	0.438303411693	It's going in and that's going to be it, going into Tennessee.
0.0	0.476096062007	And, sending mixed signals to kids about drugs is a disaster.
0.0	0.433051914995	I think we need to do a lot more than we're doing.
0.0	0.409761770892	Everybody should.
0.0	0.47884918186	I did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild.

0.0	0.5	My program would move the 104 programs of the federal Department of Education into four block grants, and send them back to the states because income inequality is driven by a lack of skills when kids don't get what they need to be able to compete and win in this country.

0.0	0.5	We were the only state in American that went four years in a row without a penny increase in college tuition.
0.0	0.488797123224	I don't know enough about the technology, Martha, to be able to say what it is, but I have a lot of confidence in our tech experts.
0.0	0.443832554669	It's easier to talk to your friends.
0.0	0.48498025537	In the 21st century, it has to be more of a merit-based system, and that is why our legal immigration system is in need of modernization.
1.0	0.613421452349	And we were able to put our city on the path for the biggest reduction in crime of any major city in America over the next ten years.
0.0	0.430882475111	So I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.43407227982	I don't know where you...

0.0	0.462015119632	I don't think the term is what's important.
0.0	0.413616956094	We were wrong.
0.0	0.474106850782	They have to have some legal basis and precedence for being able to follow the law instead of making the law up, and my goal is -- in appointing Supreme Court justices, would be to point -- to appoint justices who would follow the law.
0.0	0.483382847546	Hopefully after the 2016 election, some of the Republicans will come to their senses and realize we are not going to deport 11 or 12 million people in this country.
0.0	0.475207473173	Meantime, wages have stagnated for 40 years.
0.0	0.435306907241	I'm proud that I gave him that advice.

0.0	0.5	It was country after country without making the investment in human intelligence to understand who the new leaders were and the new forces were that are coming up.
0.0	0.489217166785	If we were to expand Medicaid, for every uninsured person we would cover, we'd kick more than one person out of private insurance or remove their opportunity to get private insurance.

0.0	0.46883774604	I have a plan that I've put forward to go after ISIS.
0.0	0.489750733182	I think it would be better the more -- the less abortions we have, so the more states that we have that made abortion illegal, the better, as far as trying to save and preserve lives.
0.0	0.491640301557	So many more Americans have been killed by the combination of heroin and these highly addictive pain pills, and yet, we refuse to act.
0.0	0.475537021617	When we put money into the hands of working people, they're going to go out and buy goods, they're going to buy services and they're going to create jobs in doing that.

0.0	0.446474478338	But you know what we did in Maryland?
0.0	0.48677309949	Secretary Clinton also said we -- it was not just the invasion of Iraq which Secretary Clinton voted for and has since said was a big mistake -- and, indeed, it was.
0.0	0.473883552917	Our job has to be to recognize the conflict between the two.
0.0	0.472421616075	I know we can do this because we're still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.478981218654	If we're willing to do what it takes now, the 21st century is going to be the new American century, greater than any other era we've had in the history of this great nation.
0.0	0.526597510833	And here's why.
0.0	0.473306970914	I could only get two Republican votes on that.
0.0	0.456564598795	You don't serve us.
0.0	0.457121544265	They serve in the military.
0.0	0.5	Our Medicare for all single-payer proposal will save the average middle class family $5,000 a year.
0.0	0.471132571414	And you say to yourself, "How does that help us," right?
0.0	0.5	And I think that the record of the governor of the last 14 years of the 12th largest economy in the world is just the medicine America is looking for.
0.0	0.474783070825	Look, we need more Americans to be involved in the political process.
0.0	0.486438053768	Look, we have waiting lists for veterans that are -- that are leaving because of the sequester where we're gutting the military.
0.0	0.49170433397	And what we did is try to move that department toward community policing, so that the police officers become part of the community and not, as we see, in some cities an oppressive force.
0.0	0.492276500445	Or a young woman who had been performing at President Obama's second inauguration coming home, absolutely stellar young woman, hanging out with her friends in a park getting shot by a gang member.
0.0	0.474525459823	Now, when it mattered, he stood up and took on Wall Street.
0.0	0.457745702074	Now, you've got Europe.
0.0	0.450961667619	...we need to honor our promises...
0.0	0.419060854775	That's true.
0.0	0.43907335411	Folks, you want to --
0.0	0.412165101177	I would change them.
0.0	0.401901202335	OK.
0.0	0.491344367336	Look at what happened in '08, AIG, a big insurance company, Lehman Brothers, an investment bank helped to bring our economy down.
0.0	0.463888273392	In fact, we need to -- wait a minute -- we need vigilance.
0.0	0.465416335937	So there's a lot of work we need to do and I want to be sure what's called the AUMF, has the authority that is needed going forward.
0.0	0.47296096154	My parents in this country were able to give me the chance to do all the things they never did.
0.0	0.464922237271	So, I represented New York, and I represented New York on 9/11 when we were attacked.
0.0	0.477487760021	And what we need to do is bring people together to work on the agreement where there is broad consensus and that's what I intend to do.
0.0	0.526597510833	Not at all.
0.0	0.443478927625	Let me say on that...
0.0	0.484953969785	Our staff found information on our computers from the Clinton campaign.
0.0	0.429583064002	I don't like that.
0.0	0.422350329632	But we're not gambling.
1.0	0.601541898394	It didn't say a word about legalization.
0.0	0.473033589605	But at the end of the day, no doubt, the Affordable Care Act is a step forward.
0.0	0.526597510833	No, no.
0.0	0.450644515149	This is a great nation.
0.0	0.463417170792	Well, I agree that we have to have the toughest screening and vetting...
0.0	0.494518906118	We are at the threshold of a new era of American progress, but it's going to require that we act as Americans, based on our principles, here at home, making an economy that works for all of us.
0.0	0.462083905942	Gronkowski is still going strong.
0.0	0.473806300301	And that's the only way we'll ever balance our budget.
0.0	0.481880565137	The last thing we need is to throw our country into a contentious debate about health care again.
0.0	0.470145977205	The truth is this, the big problem, we need a leader in Washington who understands how to get something done, not to talk about it, not to propose it, to get it done.
0.0	0.489376245856	Why, for the life of me, I do not understand why did we stop doing vocational education in America, people that can work with their hands; people you can train to do this work while they're still in high school so they can graduate ready to go work.
0.0	0.494514001575	We have ended the terrible situation that people with pre- existing conditions were faced with where they couldn't find at any affordable price health care.
0.0	0.491999053029	We have one House member from Vermont, three candidates in the race.
0.0	0.490234769766	Where the secretary and I have a very profound difference, in the last debate -- and I believe in her book -- very good book, by the way -- in her book and in this last debate, she talked about getting the approval or the support or the mentoring of Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.44715783952	And guess what, in 2011, I got a deal...
0.0	0.435945274026	I have more accountants than I have nurses.
0.0	0.479895460914	How can you run for the Republican nomination and be for single- payer health care?
0.0	0.487585807736	We've got Social Security that's going to be destroyed if somebody like me doesn't bring money into the country.
0.0	0.434517511353	I got the briefings.
0.0	0.455955543032	And they don't talk jobs and they don't talk China.
0.0	0.466967976951	Can you have Medicare or Social Security?
0.0	0.45386669585	I say, "That's a terrible story.
0.0	0.482684050351	You have small businesses in America that are struggling.

0.0	0.43671699613	Did she do a great job?
1.0	0.583110875893	Someone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander in chief and someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi can never be president of the United States.
0.0	0.468181682818	I think it would be a grave mistake to ask for any more Iranian troops inside Syria.
0.0	0.468976938361	I know how important it is that we have a Democrat succeed President Obama in the White House.
0.0	0.465175292514	And you shouldn't have mentioned the polls because I would have been much...
0.0	0.492336779842	Simplifying the code and lowering rates, both for corporations and -- and personal rates, is exactly what we need to do.
0.0	0.460791902431	That's a serious issue that we could work on.
0.0	0.486991647535	Here's -- apart from the -- apart from the higher prices on consumers and people are living paycheck to paycheck, apart from that, there will be retaliation.
0.0	0.480392961336	What the legislation is is $1.61 a week.
0.0	0.372039130143	John?
0.0	0.459742374708	I have studied that issue in great detail.
0.0	0.480955234484	Yes, this one falls under the category of, I have actually done this.
1.0	0.678081373639	We had a $1.4 trillion deficit.
0.0	0.5	All through the recession, we defended the highest median income in America and the second highest median income for African American families.
0.0	0.466119197794	Well, let's go with three.
0.0	0.448193389341	There'll be people here that will talk about what they're going to do.
0.0	0.489786412438	But we're becoming a third word country, because of our infrastructure, our airports, our roads, everything.
0.0	0.47856027853	We need to arm the Kurds the directly.
0.0	0.468637086368	Look, under President Obama and Secretary Clinton, they're working hard to change the American dream into the European nightmare.
0.0	0.451702194834	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the Constitution.
0.0	0.489676992518	The men and women on this stage have more ideas, more experience, more common sense than every participant in the Democratic debate.
0.0	0.417744917789	But get this.
0.0	0.505193694603	They've given out $140 million of bonuses to Veterans Department employees, including reducing the waiting lists, without giving veterans care.
0.0	0.483638247596	And this president turns his back -- this president doesn't enforce the marijuana laws in this country because he doesn't agree with them.
0.0	0.484715357537	It puts us on a level, even playing field, which brings jobs here at home...

1.0	0.484255453836	He is the foremost expert in our country on the minimum wage, and what its effects are.
1.0	0.596380063962	He put a 25 million dollar check up from his own pocket to fund that campaign and my wife Heidi and I, we ended up investing everything we owned.
0.0	0.428930967467	Why didn't they call?
0.0	0.436061103376	Came out great.
0.0	0.481209455971	As a result of his efforts and the efforts of Joe Biden against unprecedented, I was there in the Senate, unprecedented Republican obstructionism, we have made enormous progress.
0.0	0.425093508028	So you might not.
0.0	0.456573941807	I hope Congress says no to this deal.
0.0	0.47457239487	Big and powerful use big and powerful government to their advantage.
0.0	0.373838660474	Don't do it."
0.0	0.492587106897	There is no issue in American public policy that I have worked on more day in and day out than this painful issue of policing, of law enforcement, criminal justice and race in America.
1.0	0.5	According to the statistics that I'm familiar with, a black male baby born today stands a one in four chance of ending up in the criminal justice system.
0.0	0.422301430922	Yes.
0.0	0.459374710509	It was an investment bank.
0.0	0.442720032699	But judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.473390932497	They get them on the black market.
0.0	0.372039130143	So was I, John.
0.0	0.5	What is important to understand is we have organizations, whether it is ISIS or Al Qaida, who do believe we should go back several thousand years.
0.0	0.467119011842	We pay federal taxes.
0.0	0.484430830423	Because seniors, if they are retired, are no longer earning an income from a job.
1.0	0.5	We stuck to the fact that Americans are tired of Washington corporate interests and Democrats who are interested in just politics and power and they're looking for someone who's going to fight for them; looking for someone who's going to grow manufacturing sector of our economy, so those 74 percent of Americans who don't have a college degree have a chance to rise again.
0.0	0.469526445649	I voted for comprehensive immigration reform in 2007.
0.0	0.526597510833	...
0.0	0.493825801812	We have to go after terrorist networks, predominantly ISIS -- that's not the only one, but let's focus on that for a minute.
0.0	0.5	We've got 11 million undocumented people in this country.
0.0	0.442339256651	Caesar's -- excuse me -- Caesar's, the Rolls-Royce, as you know, is in bankruptcy.
0.0	0.472282714112	I -- I've been for pausing on admitting the Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.45039288877	The fact is, there is a big overhang.
0.0	0.481535345222	It's coming from all over South and Latin America, and it's coming probably -- probably -- from the Middle East.
0.0	0.481548513827	If you -- we will not solve our nation's problems by resorting to the divisive ideologies of our past, or by returning to polarizing figures from our past.
0.0	0.5	I think the other problem is we have a legal immigration system that's outdated, it's primarily based on whether you have family members living here.
0.0	0.473261468693	And the fact is, let law enforcement make those decisions.
0.0	0.464593005119	And on this issue of the Medicare in particular, it's important because they're going to demagogue what we're saying here tonight.
0.0	0.486699589792	I actually agree with Governor O'Malley about the need for common sense gun safety measures.
0.0	0.473050172687	Got 70 votes in the United States Senate.
0.0	0.460139970388	When you're a governor, you're held accountable for everything you do.
0.0	0.469141055955	Exactly what to do as it relates to ISIS.
0.0	0.490719784397	After that you pay 10 percent as a flat tax going up.
0.0	0.446770969292	I'm wearing a Trump tie tonight.
0.0	0.471173939726	So, it's going to be my responsibility to make sure we move forward to solve these problems that are now out in the open.
0.0	0.466159791322	And together, we can solve these problems that hurt us and heal America.
0.0	0.440750372276	They don't know what they're doing."
0.0	0.491485650486	It is very clear there will be no progress on this issue in any way, shape or form, until you prove to the people of this country that illegal immigration is under control.
0.0	0.429898753981	Right.
0.0	0.492910813643	You know, on my very first visit to New Hampshire in this campaign, I was in Keene, and I was asked what are you going to do about the heroin epidemic?
0.0	0.408515592635	We serve you.
0.0	0.45370958184	That is why Hillary Clinton cannot win this election.
0.0	0.476067323885	Senator Sanders, from a debate in 2008, quote what I said.
0.0	0.489061019496	The United States has, unfortunately, been victimized by terrorism going back decades.
0.0	0.482127232402	She wants to continue down the path of Iran, Benghazi, the Russian reset, Dodd-Frank, all the things that have -- that have gone wrong in this country, she would be a national security mess.
0.0	0.468190235968	ON the other side, you have so many Republicans, and what do they care about?
0.0	0.460557818044	They will be our early warning signal.
0.0	0.480735056431	And frankly, it just came out, and in Iowa now, as you know, Ted, in the last three polls, I'm beating you.
0.0	0.457571917947	I strongly support the president's executive actions.
0.0	0.486171261851	And I feel very strongly that I have an agenda, I have a record that really does respond to a lot of the specific needs that the women in our country face.
0.0	0.5	Just as we require every major department, every county to report its major crimes, we should require police departments to report their discourtesy, brutality, excessive force.
0.0	0.476094258733	I'm not talking about now, I'm talking about in the future they're building massive plants in China because China does not want Boeing building their planes here, they want them built in China, because China happens to be smart the way they do it, not the way we do it.
0.0	0.458627164011	We both listened to the information from Bush and Cheney.
0.0	0.438193556505	I'm really rich.
0.0	0.410960656197	Very valuable.
0.0	0.458732450197	The other Arab countries have a role to play in this.
0.0	0.475105083513	We differ, however, on a couple of key points.
0.0	0.5	There is one major country -- the United States -- which ends up spending almost three times per capita what they do in the U.K. guaranteeing health care to all people, 50 percent more than they do in France guaranteeing health care to all people, far more than our Canadian neighbors, who guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.46901511458	You just don't make promises like this.
0.0	0.476290619499	They're controlled fully -- they're controlled fully by the lobbyists, by the donors, and by the special interests, fully.
0.0	0.463766152012	You know, every election we hear a lot of talk.
0.0	0.429256772449	Credibility counts.
0.0	0.465619539134	You've got to go the extra mile.
0.0	0.456662749451	Our country is in crisis.
0.0	0.454581658364	That's gonna be the real growth engine.
0.0	0.43381096739	The domino theory, you know, if Vietnam goes, China, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.
0.0	0.471935731586	Because I do believe that we have a history and a tradition, that is part of our values system and we don't want to sacrifice our values.
0.0	0.48579474652	And it troubles me that people are rewarded for tearing down our country.
0.0	0.5	Keeping the government open and continuing to borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.474606270824	And I said, "well, if he wanted to play a song, maybe he could play, 'New York, New York'?"
0.0	0.477010013743	We call that the American Dream, although, it's built on the universal dream of a better life.
0.0	0.485268397382	It will be done on time, on budget, way below cost, way below what anyone ever thought.
0.0	0.4670118919	Well, Neil, I think we've got to work on a two-pronged approach.
0.0	0.494085160492	The better way of dealing with this -- the better way of dealing with this is recognizing that there are people in, you know, the -- Islamic terrorists inside, embedded in refugee populations.
0.0	0.491908355239	Just as morale in the military has plummeted in the last seven, so it had then.
0.0	0.466820884626	But it was also the cascading effects that followed that.
0.0	0.430815868371	I like them.
0.0	0.5	So I have a total net worth, and now with the increase, it'll be well-over $10 billion.
0.0	0.456458294159	So I'm going to keep making that case.
0.0	0.420474576716	I like China.
0.0	0.490719423919	It seems to me that given our history as a nation that has been a beacon of hope for the oppressed, for the downtrodden, that I very strongly disagree with those Republican candidates who say, you know what, we've got to turn our backs on women and children who left their home with nothing, nothing at all.
0.0	0.431333610622	We hate all the Muslims, because all of the Muslims are terrorists.
0.0	0.471532353566	That's the issue that we need to tackle as Americans, and we can do it and we know how.
0.0	0.475589249245	It was some of the most progressive members of the United States Congress who opposed it for that reason.
0.0	0.484350499741	Community has to understand that that police officer wants to get home at night, and not -- not to lose their life.
0.0	0.489278502332	I like Marco too, and two years ago, he called me a conservative reformer that New Jersey needed.
0.0	0.493442948738	When millions of Americans rose up against Obamacare, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.480608764337	So we have a good group of people.
0.0	0.47382640847	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.393014865639	This is extraordinary.
0.0	0.483874617781	We need to have some coalitions in that part of the world to go after ISIS, but we also need to send a clear message.
0.0	0.473236203742	If you're not willing to do that, nobody wants to do it, but if you're not willing to gradually raise the age, you're not serious about fixing either one of them.
0.0	0.428003795296	That's what I said.
0.0	0.482540725207	Why in God's name does Wall Street make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.474114734881	That's the kind of leadership this country needs.
0.0	0.470765261037	And that's what we need to be doing to the best of our ability in our country.
0.0	0.440755867487	This was a question on entitlements.
0.0	0.492119484352	I don't think the founders put the Second Amendment as number two by accident.
0.0	0.486457058537	We're reducing taxes to 15 percent.
0.0	0.321389529923	...Thank you.
0.0	0.505757024433	But together, every single year, I expanded drug treatment funding within our city and then I expanded it in our state, and we were saving lives every single year doing the things that work, intervening earlier, understanding the continuum of care that's required until we got hit like every other state in the state -- in the United States, especially in New Hampshire and in the northeast with this opioid addiction, the over-prescribing.
0.0	0.475489352336	In my view, it doesn't go anywhere near far enough.
0.0	0.483138205984	At the same time we're doing all that, the Pentagon must be reformed so we get what we need for our men and women in uniform.
0.0	0.453794404095	I absolutely would call on them to collaborate and cooperate, yes.
0.0	0.487193610139	We are at war with people who use their religion for purposes of power and oppression.
1.0	0.569949949857	I think it's great standing up here with the senator and the governor talking about these issues, because you're not going to hear anything like this from any of the Republicans who are running for president.
0.0	0.475445093567	And that is the danger that democracies find themselves susceptible to when unscrupulous leaders try to turn us upon each other.
0.0	0.526597510833	But...
0.0	0.484131559417	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.446805578732	The millionaires and billionaires are doing great under Obama.
0.0	0.461206485866	So, I think gun-free zones are a catastrophe.
0.0	0.479368717817	I mean, we had to borrow so much money to send them to college and were not the only ones.
0.0	0.5	He used chemical weapons, he's killed, now, over a quarter of a million of his own people, and this president has done nothing.
0.0	0.479784803348	It's really a question for all of us to answer, every single one of our children deserves the chance to live up to his or her god-given potential.
0.0	0.487025512255	In that State of the Union, President Obama didn't so much as mention the 10 sailors that had been captured by Iran.
0.0	0.456893075207	And work on a timetable to get rid of Assad, hopefully through Democratic elections.
0.0	0.447161358618	And let me be clear.
1.0	0.61224723619	If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world -- and we double tax, as you know.
0.0	0.467263664318	A few days ago a similar incident happened.
0.0	0.493002535162	We need all of them to be part of exactly what the first George Bush put together in the first Gulf War.
0.0	0.490560330913	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.484576860567	I know for a fact how difficult it is to raise children, how expensive it's become for working families.
0.0	0.469590411783	That is a bad deal and an evil situation, and presidents have looked the other way.
0.0	0.420424767073	This is not entitlement, it's not welfare.
0.0	0.458628317837	But we are where we are right now.
0.0	0.454212489166	And we have -- and let me make this promise.
0.0	0.468380064126	And that's the way my parents came legally in 1956.
0.0	0.361756700676	He's very smooth.
0.0	0.467285179025	I find -- I mean, it's just a very different, you know, historical perspective here.
1.0	0.492095001387	We owe $19 trillion, boy am I good at solving debt problems.
0.0	0.440610360397	Because we don't want them in and out -- we don't want them in and out of the prisons.
0.0	0.456789749076	Let me get a chance to respond.
0.0	0.467058031527	All of us believe climate change is real.
0.0	0.476177779416	But if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in Flint.
0.0	0.490911235337	What a president of the United States has got to do -- and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility -- is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe, that we work with allies around the world to protect...
0.0	0.526597510833	How about this?
0.0	0.477263655322	And if I find anybody else involved in this, they will also be fired.
0.0	0.46935272267	There are ways to retrain the 50 and 51-year-olds, because they've got great value.
0.0	0.452728638049	And it creates a -- a contempt for the law, for the rule of law.
0.0	0.477112317574	So we've got to look at the full range and then come to some smart decisions about having more streamlined and focused approach.
0.0	0.433102193371	You're certainly not very good.
0.0	0.466265453437	I propose to reverse that and get this economy moving again.
0.0	0.44864039802	We are at war with violent extremism.
0.0	0.481613230241	(LAUGHTER) Now that we've gotten the Donald Trump portion out of the way...
0.0	0.461161337486	But I think to suggest that I have voiced criticism, this blurb that you talk about, you know what the blurb said?
0.0	0.46967970672	And John Kerry described it as attacks that would be unbelievably small.
0.0	0.399179197614	This is a humanitarian catastrophe.
0.0	0.427246576245	You're not interested in an answer.
0.0	0.427679462854	But I went further than that.
0.0	0.418606655158	I'm in competition with them.
0.0	0.476972740658	What you need to do is free up interest rates.
0.0	0.471964710351	He's been a good governor, and he's a heck of a lot better than his predecessor that would have bankrupted New Jersey.
0.0	0.41655441657	We got it.
0.0	0.45325110915	The more the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected are advantaged.
0.0	0.484526211869	We're giving young people and working people hope that real change can take place in America.
0.0	0.490448283915	His plan is a good plan, and I will note that my 10% plan also eliminates the payroll tax, eliminates the death tax,
0.0	0.469090019164	The matter is what orders exist now that shouldn't exist?
0.0	0.460945389714	But with all our problems with Russia, with all our problems with everything -- everything, they got away with it again.
0.0	0.48832526656	In this particular moment of serious crises, saying to the American people don't give up on the political process.
0.0	0.481802383288	I'd like to just mention something about my tax plan, and how it relates to the discussion...
0.0	0.483657415884	So whether it's green cards or any other form of entry into America, when I'm president if we do not know who you are or why you are coming, you are not going to get into the United States of America.
0.0	0.5	But the greatest gains, percentage-wise, for people, are gonna be at the lower end of our plan, and here's why: because in addition to a general personal exemption, we are increasing the per-child tax credit for working families.
0.0	0.477027151118	I choose him as my vice presidential candidate, and the Democrats sue because we can't take him along for the ride.
0.0	0.481729885058	But I look at this country today, and I look at how divided we are, I look at how politicians are always posturing and issuing sound bites but never solving problems.
0.0	0.468072078835	Look these are the things that we did in own state through the recession.
0.0	0.48882109222	Now, you can say that's a tax on the middle class.
0.0	0.5	Look, the -- the simple fact is that my plan actually gives the middle class the greatest break: $2,000 per family.
0.0	0.453886789901	You want one?
0.0	0.48627520814	It was the first time we did it since man walked on the moon.
0.0	0.441685637102	And we got to look at the big picture here.
0.0	0.368216141408	I am against the raids.
0.0	0.437144601227	I've gotta do it."
0.0	0.463941390048	You target the bad guys.
0.0	0.350564728514	David...
0.0	0.451643781039	Folks, it's not too late.
0.0	0.439495030842	I think he'd be a great spirit."
0.0	0.389784463871	And so that was his explanation.
0.0	0.474863863	I chaired the National Commission on Homeland Security Committee for United States.
0.0	0.5	Of course we have to do more to incentivize profit sharing, like we see with Market Basket right here in New Hampshire and New England, where all of the employees get a chance to share in the profits.
0.0	0.484982379869	We don't represent Wall Street, we don't represent the billionaire class, so it ends up I'm the only candidate up here of the many candidates who has no Super PAC.
0.0	0.422774128832	This is what's going on.
0.0	0.446729063213	It all will be scrutinized.
0.0	0.4794901483	I want to go back to what we were talking about earlier, this budget deal in Washington.
0.0	0.484331209995	The the truth of the matter is, big government benefits the wealthy, it benefits the lobbyists, it benefits the giant corporations.
0.0	0.440769096996	The threat is Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.465007518851	In fact, sometimes it's not that way...
0.0	0.464926921667	to save a company.
0.0	0.44987041591	We just can't do it any longer.
0.0	0.484928380683	But here's something that I believe we have to do as we put together an international coalition, and that is we have to understand that the Muslim nations in the region -- Saudi Arabia, Iran, Turkey, Jordan -- all of these nations, they're going to have to get their hands dirty, their boots on the ground.
0.0	0.455435912253	First of all...
0.0	0.526597510833	No.
0.0	0.477493481664	I -- I think -- I think as Democrats we ought to proudly support the Affordable Care Act, improve it, and make it the model that we know it can be.
0.0	0.526597510833	I have.
0.0	0.467939622809	Everybody just needs to get used to it.
0.0	0.485525526271	I have the best courses in the world, so I'd say, you what, if he wants to -- I have one right next to the White House, right on the Potomac.
0.0	0.424059130268	Not everybody remembers that.
0.0	0.472361913665	... No, I said I do not support blanket amnesty...
0.0	0.483576236738	Why do -- why, over her political career has Wall Street been a major -- the major campaign contributor to Hillary Clinton?
1.0	0.595517471872	And then in Ohio, of course, I had to bring about big reform, again, because we were so far in the hole and now we just found out we are up over 400,000 jobs since I took over as governor.
0.0	0.450394902641	I didn't inherit any money.
0.0	0.486761558795	I am convinced because I see how he works with his attorney general, not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.422781876626	That's what we need.
0.0	0.441681278276	And you know, he's right.
0.0	0.441495784174	But they should have the right of determine -- self-determination.
0.0	0.445657505317	You've heard some of those tonight.
0.0	0.458256758906	You have got to pick somebody who has experience, somebody that has the know-how, the discipline.
0.0	0.491082316427	And in our party, unlike the Republican party, we actually believe that the more our people learn, the more they will earn and higher education should be a right for every kid.
0.0	0.44472725898	So, we have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.459606272919	And there is a lot we can do in college affordability.
0.0	0.455738935012	We have people that are morally corrupt.
0.0	0.526597510833	No.
0.0	0.458949633792	So, I would pass legislation outlawing abortion after 20 weeks.
0.0	0.5	By the time I left, the average tax burden on Maryland families was the same as when I started.
0.0	0.5	You have families out there paying 6 percent, 8 percent, 10 percent on student debt, refinance their homes at 3 percent.
0.0	0.474638902609	And I have to tell you, I would not want -- if I lived in Iowa, Terry Branstad administering my health care.
0.0	0.480674962356	It requires tax cuts, because that sends a message to the job creators that things are headed the right way.
0.0	0.480572166484	Nine months ago, our campaign began.
0.0	0.485185936085	I have been a strong ally with him on virtually every issue.
0.0	0.48302317044	Look, every time the Federal Government gets engaged in something it gets worse.
0.0	0.483234032578	And yet when he won, he turned to me, trusting my judgment, my experience, to become secretary of state.
0.0	0.490157548274	I think the last eight years in the private sector have allowed me to see government from the outside, and I think that is a positive thing.
1.0	0.5	Later that year, in 2004, John Kerry ran for president missing close to 60 to 70 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.412652779601	We all understand that.
0.0	0.431580695419	Play by the rules.
0.0	0.469223682046	The dictatorships have suppressed people's aspirations.
0.0	0.485736031466	You have two billionaire hedge fund managers who started a super PAC and they're advertising against me in Iowa as we speak.
0.0	0.476127540213	I saw Ted Cruz say, "we'll take citizenship off the table, and then the bill will pass, and I'm for the bill."
0.0	0.477593784892	They ain't going to like me and Wall Street is going to like me even less.
0.0	0.473142244908	The central question in this race is trust.
0.0	0.419423202062	It's peanuts.
0.0	0.5	I believe that when real unemployment is close to 10%, and when our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, Flint, Michigan comes to mind.
0.0	0.458775124032	And that's what this economy needs to -- that's what this debate needs to be about.
1.0	0.484452940715	It came out recently they have equipment that is 30 years old.
1.0	0.613059079784	So states over a period of decades have put their money elsewhere; into prisons, into highways, into things other than higher education.
0.0	0.526597510833	But Megyn...
0.0	0.469519127428	This actually is America's fight.
0.0	0.471603796478	We don't even know that we have the cards, because our leaders don't understand the game.
0.0	0.462770147754	You know why three?
0.0	0.420517681317	And that is what they told me when I was in Jordan in November.
0.0	0.464030932634	I don't think a halt is necessary.
0.0	0.446161161122	And it only makes common sense.
0.0	0.457506928929	It makes it impossible for our companies to compete, impossible.
0.0	0.487359693187	And I was going to tell you, whether I'm president or not, we better make it clear to the Saudis that we're going to support you, we're in relation with you just like we were in the first Gulf War, but you've got to knock off the funding and teaching of radical clerics who are the very people who try to destroy us and will turn around and destroy them.
0.0	0.486096146582	They're not supporting our law enforcement officers, it's making everybody nervous to get out of their cars, if you're a law enforcement officer.
1.0	0.611875860056	And I've done it when I was in Washington when we had a balanced budget; had four years of balanced budgets; paid down a half-trillion of debt.
0.0	0.458818223417	Man (ph), their mother's here as well.
0.0	0.474172226993	And that's what I'll offer to the people of the United States in this candidacy for the presidency.
1.0	0.490727262774	And our real unemployment is anywhere from 18 to 20 percent.
0.0	0.469341133053	Since he brought me up, do I not get to respond?
0.0	0.457838970104	This is the first priority.
0.0	0.477003460208	Anybody who tells me that we need every penny and every one of those is in a fantasy world.
0.0	0.477582362601	And the reason is simple: because in 2008, we elected as president someone who wasn't interested in fixing America.
0.0	0.481409986338	I would like to take a hard look at every part of the federal government and really do the kind of analysis that would rebuild some confidence in people that we're taking a hard look about what we have, you know, and what we don't need anymore.
0.0	0.451602620955	Yes, exactly, exactly.
0.0	0.526597510833	So did you.
0.0	0.486479015772	Military action, Maria, would be used when it was absolutely necessary to protect American lives and protect American interests around the world.
0.0	0.476855230355	Since he has been making all kinds of comments.
0.0	0.493963138034	You save it by making the United States, by making us rich again, by taking back all of the money that's being lost.
0.0	0.470832406003	Have been ever since I was in the Senate.
0.0	0.475983341054	Remember, we have 645 federal agencies and sub-agencies.
0.0	0.421037594828	That's what should be done.
0.0	0.449879739771	We have a role to play in this world.
0.0	0.426711269927	What they do is unbelievable, how bad.
0.0	0.48424607599	This is a part of the world where the United States has tried to play two different approaches.
0.0	0.434391430456	I agree completely.
0.0	0.5	Suicide, alcoholism, drugs, that's why we need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country, and not just a handful of billionaires who have enormous economic and political power.
0.0	0.474259543104	Let's put the gun makers and sellers on notice that they're not going to get away with it.
0.0	0.5	The United States was asked to support the Europeans and the Arab partners that we had and we did a lot of due diligence about whether we should or not, and eventually, yes, I recommended and the president decided that we would support the action to protect civilians on the ground and that led to the overthrow of Gadhafi.
0.0	0.48768854159	You know, we're building on Pennsylvania Avenue, the Old Post Office, we're converting it into one of the world's great hotels.
0.0	0.494544214456	One of them being that if you don't have some agreement within the system from states and from families and from students, it's hard to get to where we need to go.
0.0	0.462266084413	But this is nothing new.
0.0	0.492829951496	I inherited a state in New Jersey that was downtrodden, and beaten by liberal democratic policies, high taxation, high regulation.
0.0	0.47921844335	I think, Secretary Clinton, $1.61 a week is a pretty good invest.
0.0	0.467623201293	Let me give you one quick example.
0.0	0.476804552152	And when I'm president, we're not just going to have a president that gives a State of the Union and says America is the greatest country in the world.
0.0	0.494525584644	And I also voted and helped lead the effort against the war in Iraq, which will go down in history as one of the worst foreign blunders -- foreign policy blunders in the history of our country.
0.0	0.453629744947	And then what he did is redefine the role of government.
0.0	0.451643060571	Do we still have standards?
0.0	0.5	We took out the safe haven in Afghanistan, but now there is, undoubtedly, a larger safe haven and we must rise to this occasion in collaboration and with alliances to confront it, and invest in the future much better human intelligence so we know what the next steps are.
0.0	0.435216185262	It is undermining American democracy.
0.0	0.448131691917	We called in, we said, that's it.
0.0	0.469211790905	I don't think they dropped all the amendments into a hat and picked them out of a hat.
0.0	0.444979459112	They're very, very badly wounded.
0.0	0.463640370801	You have a problem with ISIS.
0.0	0.492088442649	We need an economy that works for the middle class, not just a handful of billionaires, and I will fight and lead to make that happen.
0.0	0.439918290157	And we should be a welcoming nation.
0.0	0.425649302147	You're right.
0.0	0.5	First of all, we have seen now in six years of Obamacare that it has been a disaster.
0.0	0.477472520509	don't listen to the Trumps of the world and allowing them to divide us.
0.0	0.404402826266	You have to have certainty.
0.0	0.494088656671	Well, I think -- I think that is very unfair to a few you mentioned, most particularly Jordan, which has put a lot on the line for the United States, has also taken in hundreds of thousands of refugees from Syria, and has been, therefore, subjected to threats and attacks by extremists themselves.
0.0	0.480314761247	Our country is being run by incompetent people.
0.0	0.460079280078	And when we talk about Wall Street, let's talk about Wall Street.
0.0	0.493908071237	But I want to quickly say, one of the areas that Senator Sanders touched on in talking about education and certainly talking about health care is his commitment to really changing the systems.
1.0	0.597213081429	A vat is imposed as a sales tax when you buy a good.
0.0	0.440060494378	They can have it anyway you want.
0.0	0.5	But I knew that good people who wanted to be a part of the American dream have become trapped in dependency because the federal government and the state government had made it in their economic interest not to take a job because the benefits that they didn't work were better.
0.0	0.477182923414	The New York Times a few weeks back had a columnist who wrote a column saying, "Anybody But Cruz."
0.0	0.431853448619	She should not feel uncomfortable about her citizenship.
0.0	0.475284524669	Otherwise, law enforcement is blind -- blind before, blind during, and, unfortunately, in many instances, blind after.
0.0	0.439924619604	This is a war for the soul of Islam.
0.0	0.5	And what I have concluded is that the best policy is to get rid of all government subsidies, and get the government out of our lives, and let people rise and fall based on how good they are.
0.0	0.45559729959	That's not the way the game is supposed to be played.
0.0	0.440480270869	I think it's a two-pronged issue.
0.0	0.481101383683	So what we're going to have to start doing instead of, you know, picking on this group or this group, is we're going to have to have a major reduction in the regulatory influence that is going on.
0.0	0.474867129546	So we need new leadership -- yes.
0.0	0.5	Change the Mexico City policy, not take one dime of taxpayer money to fund abortion organizations overseas, and restore the NSA that's been gutted.
0.0	0.481970481706	You know, whatever your issue, your cause, the festering problem you hoped would resolved, the political class has failed you.
0.0	0.466633656479	Iran is taking over Iraq, and they're taking it over big league.
0.0	0.483013167528	We'll hire 20,000 new border agents instead of 20,000 new IRS agents.
0.0	0.321389529923	Thank you.
0.0	0.5	I think we ought to give Ukraine offensive weapons and I think we ought to fight them on the economic basis because Putin is a one- horse country: oil and energy.
0.0	0.461767194671	And so, when we look at these complex problems, I wish it could be either/or.
0.0	0.491473703941	I happen to believe that Putin is doing what he is doing because his economy is increasingly in shambles and he's trying to rally his people in support of him.
0.0	0.483937152367	We have Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view.
0.0	0.466577490599	I mean, I heard what they both said, I saw it on the video.
0.0	0.477689661325	It is a different, fundamental military strategy than what we've seen from Barack Obama.
0.0	0.454711971596	So, you know, we'll take our progress wherever we can find it.

0.0	0.471166198678	There's never going do be perfect bill.
0.0	0.488804398027	I -- I said I made a mistake on Iraq, and I would love to see Senator Sanders join with some of my colleague in addition the Senate that I see in the audience.
0.0	0.475575036797	When people ask me, whose fault is it?
0.0	0.485093939157	Well, let me first describe Iran because they're not just a normal nation state.
0.0	0.489919599713	Secondly, I certainly support that we need to tear down cyber walls, not on a mass basis, but on a targeted basis.
0.0	0.482339437746	But, I said, "This is going to be an election that's based on competence, because people are tired of these nice people.
0.0	0.476059362148	I've had a lot of folks give me donations from all kinds of backgrounds say, I don't agree with you on everything, but I like what you do.
0.0	0.48178004631	At the core of that resolution is an agreement I negotiated in June of 2012 in Geneva, which set forth a cease-fire and moving toward a political resolution, trying to bring the parties at stake in Syria together.
0.0	0.489788083294	I do not believe that we need to wholesale destroy every American citizen's privacy in order to go after those that we know are suspect or are -- are already a problem.
0.0	0.488259635917	But the issue for us is to have a Congress that stands up and says not only no, but "Hell no" to this money going to a regime that is going to use it for terror, Susan Rice has said that, and we need to stand up and strongly and clearly tell the ayatollah that -- whoever the next president of the United States is going to be, and I'll promise you, if it's me, the first thing that I will do is tear up that agreement with Iran.
0.0	0.479480737016	Come on, that's just not -- you scare senior citizens with that.
0.0	0.478709090526	Obviously, I believe that on a college campus, there should be enough respect so people hear each other.
0.0	0.484539994839	...incentives for people to keep people healthy, rather than giving the incentives to treat them when they're sick?
0.0	0.472944687887	Did any of you get a phone call from Bill Clinton?

0.0	0.485228857323	Donald, Donald -- can I -- I hope you reconsider this, because this policy is a policy that makes it impossible to build the coalition necessary to take out ISIS.
0.0	0.482497225294	This is not a conflict where we send in the third divisions of Marines.
0.0	0.486167585596	You read about all the companies now that are doing business -- about to do business in Iran, and if we don't get this settled now, with other countries in the world, about sanctions, then Iran could violate that agreement, and we're the only ones putting the sanctions on.
0.0	0.463638307695	This deal in Washington is an example of why Washington's broken.

0.0	0.492667248172	Listen, in any Republican primary, everyone is going to say they support the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.5	What I would like for the media now is for us to be talking about why the middle class is disappearing, why we have more people in jail than any other country, why we have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, and we're the only major country on Earth without paid family and medical leave.

0.0	0.39847947423	Absolutely.
0.0	0.412975819862	Here's what I'd do.
0.0	0.46823992515	The contrast with the Democratic debate, where every fawning question from the media was, "Which of you is more handsome and why?"
0.0	0.461219764502	So the indignation that you carry on, some of the stuff, you have to also own then.
0.0	0.526597510833	...
0.0	0.484718579765	The reason I did so well last time is not just because of the vision, it's because I have a track record in Washington, D.C. of getting things done.
0.0	0.383745699129	We have losers.
0.0	0.463995737261	And so I think really that vote is going to stay in the Paul household.
0.0	0.444257999987	He's weak on immigration.
0.0	0.414198013018	We need Jordan.
0.0	0.462532870141	And we have to take properly vetted refugees ourselves.
0.0	0.477021664274	Because of all the federal mandates and federal laws, it was too expensive.
0.0	0.460893410945	How are these people gonna lead us?
0.0	0.451274246266	... tariffs that come against us.
0.0	0.321389529923	Thank you.

0.0	0.423216249342	Our symbol is the Statue of Liberty.
0.0	0.486629041327	I am a little skeptical about your governor actually caring enough about higher education to make any kind of commitment like that.
0.0	0.459873800233	And I say, look, it's not Republicans' fault, it's not Democrats' fault, it's your grandparents' fault for having too many damn kids.
0.0	0.416246427477	But I would add this.
0.0	0.321389529923	Thank you.
0.0	0.443478927625	Kathie, let me say this.
0.0	0.491968670335	In fact, if you remember, 50, 60 years ago, the University of California, City University of New York were virtually tuition-free.
0.0	0.474652204693	You know, I completely agree with Senator Sanders.
0.0	0.469971893549	It's the strongest pro-worker immigration plan.
0.0	0.5	We have to get down to creating a country that's not going to have the kind of problems that we've had with people flying planes into the World Trade Centers, with the -- with the shootings in California, with all the problems all over the world.
0.0	0.473252803929	I mean, you have great constitutional lawyers that say you can't run.
0.0	0.481609977692	We want to destroy ISIS, it has to be in the air and on the ground.
0.0	0.44472725898	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.479946030498	We have wounded soldiers, who I love, I love -- they're great -- all over the place, thousands and thousands of wounded soldiers.
0.0	0.481107694936	That's the way to get women's wages up, and that's good for them and good for their families and good for our communities.
0.0	0.471404043842	I watched the video of Senator Rubio.
0.0	0.429898753981	That's right.
0.0	0.412868148225	Think about it.
0.0	0.462802058616	I'm going to keep making sure that everything I've done, everything that I stand for is going to be well known.
0.0	0.466163204111	I don't see a lot of weakness on this stage, quite frankly.
0.0	0.459947117841	They've become rich.
0.0	0.487644964863	So this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement.
0.0	0.488958159369	We don't have enough competition and we don't have enough oversight of what the insurance companies are charging everybody right now.
1.0	0.469086831876	That's exactly what the Republican establishment says too.
0.0	0.460080254794	I made it the old-fashioned way.
0.0	0.45275667797	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.432699285676	Chris, please attack Ted.
0.0	0.526597510833	That's what he is.
0.0	0.46594517967	And I will go back to Washington with my plan.
0.0	0.429898753981	All right.
0.0	0.429959896242	But the poll numbers have.
0.0	0.419060854775	It's true.
0.0	0.438694526567	...numerically, it's gonna be higher.
0.0	0.5	...is the lowest personal rate any candidate up here has, and what it would also enable us to do is for every citizen to fill out their taxes on a postcard so we can eliminate the IRS.
0.0	0.485563558186	And we've got to get back to where people can save money again, where they can invest in their families, and I don't think a middle-class tax should be part of anybody's plan right now.
0.0	0.464870381463	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.493362331894	Number one, you have people in this country that...
0.0	0.457000735548	I know the bad ones.
0.0	0.448236108565	Chris I was mentioned in that question.
0.0	0.436693969148	Alzheimers, diabetes, heart disease and cancer.
0.0	0.46936993545	I would say that I would and I have a permit, which is very unusual in New York -- a permit to carry.
0.0	0.443523171866	You know, that's so simple.
0.0	0.489219364698	Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns.
0.0	0.486148399293	I was one -- I was the only -- one of only seven states that had a AAA bond rating.
0.0	0.5	That is why I support a $12 national federal minimum wage.
0.0	0.458451974517	So listen, this is the difference between being a governor and a senator.
0.0	0.387550410317	Yeah.
0.0	0.413958334643	That's good.
0.0	0.5	In my own state, after the children in that Connecticut classroom were gunned down, we passed comprehensive gun safety legislation with background checks, ban on assault weapons, and Senator, I think we do need to repeal that immunity that you granted to the gun industry.
0.0	0.483287938648	Well, listen, I've spent my entire life defending the Constitution before the U.S. Supreme Court.
0.0	0.475512245553	You know where their United States headquarters is located?
0.0	0.485201334466	Part of the reason why it hasn't risen because sometimes we're not giving people the skills they need.
1.0	0.583574375734	They were wrong.
0.0	0.425459079386	... funding to them.
0.0	0.489247644659	Now, there has been a lot of turmoil and trouble as they have tried to deal with these radical elements which you find in this arc of instability, from north Africa to Afghanistan.
0.0	0.488732911375	When somebody is addicted and seeking help, they should not have to wait three, four months in order to get that help.
0.0	0.526597510833	...
0.0	0.5	ISIS is a group that wants to trigger an apocalyptic showdown in the city of Dabiq -- not the city of Dubuque; I mis-said -- mis-said that wrong once (inaudible) time -- the city of Dabiq in Syria.
0.0	0.47361691753	You know, of the few questions I've got, the last one I need is to give him some more time.
0.0	0.448605054983	So I've watched the politicians.
0.0	0.456961060419	... the fact is, Neil, let's think about -- let's think about -- and I want to maybe -- I hope the president is watching tonight, because here's what I'd like to tell him.
0.0	0.494306828622	And one of the reasons in some states why the percentage cost has gone up so much is because governors there would not extend Medicaid.
0.0	0.459796250322	And I applaud his record in Maryland.
0.0	0.477922135972	It enables us to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	0.473467378668	But I guess the final thing that -- that I would say is this is the kind of debate we need to take to the Republicans in the fall.
0.0	0.446151898671	Thousands.
0.0	0.451186211256	There's been no crowd like this.
0.0	0.466809430392	I think Bernie Sanders is good candidate for president of Sweden.
0.0	0.421653274018	He can't have it both ways.
0.0	0.482777888487	You have gotten a whole lot of money over the years from Wall Street.
0.0	0.505341405253	And not only did I win, but I then worked with a Democratic legislature to put in place the most sweeping conservative reforms of any state in America, taking us from the most dangerous state in America to the fourth safest; reducing our welfare rolls by over 1 million, and replacing over 700,000 private sector jobs.
0.0	0.465751885119	Then he'll call all sorts of political people, and I'll say, "Sorry, fellas.
0.0	0.506838835276	We can save and preserve and strengthen Social Security by making no changes for seniors, but for younger workers gradually increasing the retirement age, changing the rate of growth so that it matches inflation, and critically allowing younger workers to keep a portion of our tax payments in a personal account that we own, we control them, we can pass on to our kids.
0.0	0.413838345691	Your prosecute criminals.
0.0	0.485327371746	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you better get rid of the SuperPacs because they causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that have been made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.483844189546	Well, (inaudible) the major issue right now is whether or not we reestablish Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.492102718046	Today, we have a legal immigration system for permanent residency that is largely based on whether or not you have a relative living here.
0.0	0.5	What this campaign is not only about electing someone who has the most progressive agenda, it is about bringing tens of millions of people together to demand that we have a government that represents all of us and not just the 1 percent, who today have so much economic and political power.
1.0	0.488664667153	And I'm very proud that for the first time a majority of my donors are women, 60 percent.
0.0	0.473277206074	It is time for Republicans in D.C. to fight.
0.0	0.476378761426	By the way, unlike our country where we're totally predictable and the enemy, whether it's ISIS or anybody else, they know exactly what we're doing because we have the wrong leadership.
0.0	0.480845668403	The endorsements that I am proud of are leading conservatives like Iowa's own Congressman Steve King, who is a national co-chairman of my campaign.
0.0	0.485625869821	Well, I've been talking to a lot of these families, and this is such an outrage, both because it's bad for our economy, we're a 70 percent consumption economy, people need to feel optimistic and confident, they need to believe their hard work is going to be rewarded, and it's bad for our democracy.
0.0	0.466721167641	I congratulate Secretary of State John Kerry and the president for working on this agreement.
0.0	0.479654082942	We are lowering taxes on small business.
0.0	0.470464536807	In fact, if my mother were secretary of treasury, we would not be in a deficit situation.
1.0	0.591052829688	I'm very proud that I support legislation that is currently in the Congress, got support of almost all progressive Democrats in the House and Senate, which says we will end the absurdity of women today making 79 cents on the dollar compared to men.
0.0	0.493901211816	And the fact is that what I did do, what I did do from the beginning, Chris, as soon as I found out about it, I fired the people who were responsible.
0.0	0.470621720719	I will not shock anybody to suggest that in politics there is occasionally a little bit of hypocrisy.
0.0	0.471476265222	So the answer is no and what Jeb said is absolutely correct.
0.0	0.465452989315	The Kurds are our strongest allies.
0.0	0.471015061733	You can get it at $2.99 on Amazon.
0.0	0.422462218485	You can't do nothing.
0.0	0.469640814579	What happened with Atlantic City is very, very disgraceful.
0.0	0.417391215888	I'm getting to that.
0.0	0.482400707483	And one of his little boys said to him, "Dad, what happens if Donald Trump wins and we have to move out of our homes?"
0.0	0.438004477387	What -- what -- you're from New York?
0.0	0.470550892671	We have a stock market that is so bloated.
0.0	0.489129432155	I was the first person out of the box that opposed him on it.
0.0	0.455384804605	They;re gone.
0.0	0.367994212245	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.510110345712	So beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given -- bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money.
0.0	0.487841272827	If you just cut their income tax, there isn't much income tax to cut.
0.0	0.467687661116	End -- end Common Core.
0.0	0.44572877181	Now, here's what is going to happen.
0.0	0.487380789997	There's no nation on earth that comes close to that number.
0.0	0.487596300939	But let me also tell you, one of the issues has got to be the integration of both community and police.
0.0	0.471578696142	He's the one that did Bergdahl.
0.0	0.470233426408	But I would want to agree with something that Senator Sanders says.
0.0	0.453146496334	And, they've insinuated themselves into everything.
0.0	0.465197566209	Well, let me -- let me first of all talk a little bit about my experience.
0.0	0.5	And, then we have to go after sentencing, and that's one of the problems here in Wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn't happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level.
0.0	0.488341001184	And I traveled the country and learned how people made jobs.
0.0	0.451112839083	And I think that ought to be worth something.
0.0	0.438394230068	You gotta be -- stick with it, and all that.
0.0	0.468460825908	Well, because you can do it without profiling, Megyn, when you do it on the facts.
1.0	0.475486203609	Unfortunately, Nouri al-Maliki, the prime minister, set about decimating it.
0.0	0.477873915958	And what is missing is the political will, because too many Democrats and, sadly, too many Republicans don't want to solve this problem.
0.0	0.46790062108	Please become part of the political revolution.
0.0	0.470829763643	I will find the guy that's going to take that military and make it really work.
0.0	0.477060642858	They're looking -- they're looking to manipulate our -- the visa waiver countries to get people into the United States.
0.0	0.462192169584	So, yes, I'd absolutely would go in if he attacked.
0.0	0.433807742757	This election is not only about electing a president.
0.0	0.467052056526	My dad was a small businessman, a really small business.
0.0	0.486733332761	I would not place one American life at risk unless it was absolutely necessary.
0.0	0.469798533618	And we will always celebrate legal immigration like Dulce's great story.
0.0	0.467229759123	It's going to happen in this country, there are going to be further attacks.
0.0	0.489238328014	And every law enforcement should carry the antidote to overdose, Naloxone, so that they can save lives that are on the brink of expiring.
0.0	0.462897386091	... stirs up the demagoguery against American Muslims, that hurts us at home.
0.0	0.483631545709	Almost every hotel in Atlantic City has either been in bankruptcy or will be in bankruptcy -- the biggest.
0.0	0.449601484166	You gotta be patient.
0.0	0.464495138907	We got the kids involved in a whole lot of issues.
0.0	0.464175993947	We need to move aggressively now.
0.0	0.463475347381	But in 2015, we have a very different economy.
0.0	0.453408490043	You want to talk about moral authority.
0.0	0.443064277677	I've been there 35 times.

0.0	0.48702663488	You're an American, as is everybody else on this stage, and I would suggest we focus on who's best prepared to be commander- in-chief, because that's the most important question facing the country.
0.0	0.491967056732	I have been tried under many different emergencies and I can tell you that in each of those emergencies, whether they were inflicted by drug gangs, whether they were natural emergencies, I knew how to lead and I knew how to govern because I know how to manage people in a crisis and be very clear about the goal of protecting human life.

0.0	0.5	But I also think that these are very serious times; 75 percent of the American people think the federal government is corrupt.
0.0	0.461709353895	That means education.
0.0	0.444942746885	John, do you want me to answer or do you want to answer?
0.0	0.474117434917	You know, she only had a third-grade education, but -- you know, she knew how to stretch a dollar.
0.0	0.474787127119	The president's first impulse is do this by executive order, power he doesn't have.
0.0	0.460502890978	No, it speaks to the fact that I don't know those --
0.0	0.488919818455	So this is a major epidemic, and it has hit New Hampshire and Vermont particularly hard.
0.0	0.45402630156	We hear a lot of good plans.
0.0	0.505454650997	And that's why today you still cannot support, as I do, breaking up the big banks and making sure that we pass a modern-day Glass- Steagall, like we had in late 1999, before it was repealed and led to the crash, where so many millions of families lost their jobs and their homes.
0.0	0.488914840747	And when FDR said, "Yeah, it is," that we're going to use all of the resources that we have to create jobs, to build homes, to feed people, to protect the farmers, we are a nation which if we come together there is nothing that we could not accomplish.
0.0	0.478229219085	You'll see me on the floor of the Senate tomorrow filibustering this and saying enough is enough, no more debt.
0.0	0.456264876182	You want to talk about what we're going to be up against next year?
0.0	0.468651990575	You got Kuwait and you got Qatar and you got Saudi Arabia.
0.0	0.454588478682	Wait a minute, who in their 16th month?
0.0	0.432164599134	...and be held accountable.
0.0	0.468502326618	But if we don't know right and wrong, I think we have lost our way.
0.0	0.481826090707	You know, we have a war on virtual everything -- race wars, gender wars, income wars, religious wars, age wars.
0.0	0.472766589915	Instead, the Washington establishment raised both.
0.0	0.452569763118	And, I will tell you, I love my life.
0.0	0.424805164536	I'll check for you.
0.0	0.472825653171	We will arm and train the Kurds.
0.0	0.490049562433	There's mergers that are happening in every aspect of our country that is bad for competition and it's bad for -- for upward mobility of wages.
0.0	0.485982764173	It means that we end minimum sentencing for those people arrested.
0.0	0.450594478808	And Teddy Roosevelt is right.
0.0	0.453348886578	We're not going to dismantle everything.
0.0	0.321389529923	Thank you.
1.0	0.494696077625	We are spending hundreds of billions of dollars maintaining 5,000 nuclear weapons.
0.0	0.445045298729	The Europeans have moved on.
0.0	0.5	And it is unfair simply to say how much more the program will cost without making sure that people know that, we are doing away with cost of private insurance and that the middle class will be paying substantially less for health care on the single payer than on the Secretary's Clinton proposal.
0.0	0.383664921684	Here's the truth.
0.0	0.465523657756	Given the fact that she's a lot smarter than me, yes, she would.
0.0	0.390797126603	I wish he was here.
0.0	0.435210851428	Ever.
0.0	0.456475425944	I'm angry because our country is a mess.
0.0	0.484429284256	Our government belongs to all of us, and not just the hand full of billionaires.
0.0	0.465553150674	Former elected prosecutor, attorney general, governor, I was elected to all of those offices.
0.0	0.4845990397	Well, first of all, recognize it is a substantial problem.
0.0	0.492601800758	And let me be clear: While there are some great corporations creating jobs and trying to do the right thing, in my view -- and I say this very seriously -- the greed of the billionaire class, the greed of Wall Street is destroying this economy and is destroying the lives of millions of Americans.
0.0	0.45982325688	I think you do have a humanitarian tragedy there, as I mentioned a moment ago.
0.0	0.5	But I combine this also with the millions upon millions of dollars they've taken from regimes in the Middle East who treat women like cattle.
0.0	0.479421672372	We were the first to pass a minimum wage.
0.0	0.471743427567	But I feel that the gun-free zones and, you know, when you say that, that's target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill. That's target.
0.0	0.479459109084	John, thank you, and to all of the people in Iowa, for the role you have performed in this presidential selection process.
0.0	0.447117291019	I believe it is a right.
0.0	0.5	It'll produce enormous economic growth, and it eliminates every mandate, every subsidy, so there's no subsidies for oil and gas, no subsidies for anyone.
0.0	0.480280219256	And I have a road map and a plan right now to get us to balance.
0.0	0.476453533637	Terrorism is on the run, China, Russia is advancing their agenda at warp speed, and we pull back.
0.0	0.473494330237	Well, look, I think that she's been saying that for as long as I've known her, which is about 25 years.
0.0	0.430397224108	I feel like...
0.0	0.464183575408	A lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.439316418278	It's extraordinarily wrong.
0.0	0.494327575936	Let me say first that it is disturbing that every time one of these home-grown terrorist attacks occurs, and, as your question points out, they are occurring with far too great frequency, it turns out we had warning signals.
0.0	0.484615048952	You will also have to means-test the benefits and declare there's not enough money.
0.0	0.489306218783	Now hundreds of companies I've opened.
0.0	0.5	Why is it that we are -- why is it that we spend almost three times per capita as to what they spend in the U.K., 50 percent more than what they pay in France, countries that guarantee health care to all of their people and in many cases, have better health care outcomes.
0.0	0.455435912253	First of all...
0.0	0.444641660441	You know, they want to be a little cool.
0.0	0.458921573274	We could do a whole show on that.
0.0	0.486955766353	But I've also said for the most part, these issues would be left back to the states.
0.0	0.462308238536	And I want to make this our government.
1.0	0.592790031959	And the worst type of concentration, Secretary Clinton, is the concentration of the big banks, the big six banks that you went to and spoke to and told them, oh, you weren't responsible for the crash, not by a long shot.
0.0	0.474954645392	... of $50 billion...
0.0	0.467828664934	Whenever they have problems, we send over the ships.
0.0	0.413704652842	You are not our adversary, you are our partner.
0.0	0.5	About every two weeks, he holds a press conference talking about how he can't wait to restrict people's access to guns.
0.0	0.463851266828	I was ready to lead, but I wasn't ready to run.
0.0	0.457578551177	I think that is the real key here.
0.0	0.422207733101	But you know what?
0.0	0.47582933608	I'm the only person on this stage who's done that and we will get it done as President of the United States.
0.0	0.466032969187	Half of them had tears pouring down their face.
0.0	0.476635066155	You're talking about $2.7 trillion.
0.0	0.476185647159	I'm tired of seeing what's going on, between the border where the people flow over; people come in; they live; they shoot.
0.0	0.432107673291	Well, I did.
0.0	0.466869547197	Now, you'd have to ask yourself, why are they running ads against me?
0.0	0.440421575596	Or that we're just going to be great?
0.0	0.507001344099	92 percent -- 92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama's first term belonged to women.
0.0	0.479812021918	So, we're going to enforce the law, we're going to change policing practices, we're going to change incarceration practices, but we're also going to emphasize education, jobs, and housing.
0.0	0.46313206582	I would a whole lot rather had Carly Fiorina over there doing our negotiation than John Kerry.
0.0	0.475589894083	We lost thousands of lives, thousands in Iraq.
0.0	0.421596973888	Break them up.
0.0	0.459918385754	I was there in '89 when the wall came tumbling down because we were strong.
0.0	0.46122377058	You know, I want to go back for a moment to what we were just talking about.
0.0	0.429898753981	Right?
0.0	0.453700765769	And just thirdly, he was so nice.
0.0	0.472393973731	Eleven points, to be exact.
0.0	0.491236688187	My four children have been able to receive a good Christian education, and I've been able to save for them to go to college so they never have to have the loans that I did.
0.0	0.367391034691	I was in Burlington, Iowa.
0.0	0.449034627429	From top to bottom.
0.0	0.466855713484	I know we have a president who wants to do whatever he wants to do, and take his pen and his phone and just tell everybody what he thinks is best.
0.0	0.490696025149	I would sign an executive order protecting religious liberty, our first amendment rights, so Christian business owners and individuals don't face discrimination for having a traditional view of marriage.
0.0	0.476025821946	There's only a promise to pay by the next generation, and the next generation's not big enough to pay it.
0.0	0.410138393004	I will...
0.0	0.476935964711	We need to pass a Medicare for all single payer system.
0.0	0.474944487045	There is a better way to provide health care.
0.0	0.424936271317	I can.
0.0	0.479254331652	Now, thanks to fracking and other things, the oil is all over the place.
0.0	0.382859102389	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.46889676226	If you place bad bets, the taxpayers bail you out.
0.0	0.488199267347	So we have a lot of work to do in this campaign to make it clear where we stand in the Democratic Party, what we will do for our country, and I look forward to this evening's discussion of real issues that face the American people.
0.0	0.467319193117	We only have one or two.
0.0	0.439406425684	Here is the bottom line.
0.0	0.478281551837	And people at home are saying they've got a problem, listen to them.
0.0	0.471217659586	We have people that aren't working.
0.0	0.445408580361	I know the overrated ones.
0.0	0.410292033169	I have worked for his re-election.
1.0	0.579144415676	Well, I would certainly build on the successes of the Affordable Care Act and work to fix some of the glitches that you just referenced.
0.0	0.488240933444	And especially what these programs are asking us to pass that will do nothing to help the environment, but will be devastating for our economy.
0.0	0.462019321978	That's what we need to do as a nation.
0.0	0.48353802202	We have to lead a coalition that will take back territory from ISIS.
0.0	0.481489207146	The simple fact is that the plane that's being build here is being sold to China.
0.0	0.478288826609	I think we have achieved a great deal with the Iranian nuclear agreement to put a lid on the Iranian nuclear weapons program.
0.0	0.458090278984	What we could have done if they had said yes would have been a lot more than what we were able to have done.
0.0	0.462604946115	What that is, is just common sense.
0.0	0.42182663972	I don't want it.
0.0	0.48807463361	Second of all, and the reason I believe in a health care for all program, we need to understand that addiction is a disease, not a criminal activity.
0.0	0.480301691873	And, where we are failing abysmally is in the very high rate of recidivism we see.
0.0	0.474695047319	It's because I've been assembling a team of people who want to be involved in something that's a little bigger than themselves.
0.0	0.478991214832	I'm running for president because I'm going to create an economy that works for working families not just billionaires.
0.0	0.5	Yes, the wealthiest people, the top 1.5 percent, will pay more in taxes.
0.0	0.454649351928	We need to figure this out together.
0.0	0.45770987448	I'm not quite the fan of regime change that I believe she is.
0.0	0.46355130103	It will be a long day.
0.0	0.462591323455	We used to win, we don't win anymore.
0.0	0.5	So I have proposed debt free tuition, which I think is affordable and I would move a lot of the Pell Grant and other aid into the arena where it could be used for living expense.
0.0	0.5	And I'm going to tell you this, we need to use the benefit of our law enforcement people across this country, combined with our intelligence people across this country.
0.0	0.458988515391	I've got one more question for you then.
0.0	0.478021209481	They have bridges that make the George Washington Bridge look like small potatoes.
0.0	0.444988665442	You know, I am by my nature impatient.
0.0	0.481533236929	Save Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security without cuts.
0.0	0.489253539385	I have created tens of thousands of jobs, and I'll be creating many millions of jobs if I'm given -- if I'm given the opportunity to be president.
0.0	0.445225654548	That's was hard work.
0.0	0.5	What I believe is the United States, in fact, should join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee healthcare to all people.
0.0	0.469920135913	We need to create jobs.
0.0	0.481120413281	I think it's important for people in elected office to try to forge consensus to solve problems.
0.0	0.5	Sometimes it's because the Federal Reserve kept interest rates so low that the wealthy were able to invest in -- in strong assets like the stock market when everybody else was left behind.
0.0	0.478604147876	The business model of Wall Street is fraud.
0.0	0.386124609134	We can't.
0.0	0.483403022052	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.447745129013	And it's got to stop and it's got to stop fast.
0.0	0.485944422604	And a woman was on television this morning, and she said, "You know, Mr. Trump," and she was telling other people, and I actually called her, and she said, "You know, Mr. Trump, I always was against guns.
1.0	0.487520645857	We can't afford to have another four years like the last eight years.
0.0	0.471900434551	They said they would get rid of the unconstitutional amnesty.
0.0	0.421146299043	And here's what's going to happen.
0.0	0.458858290084	But all of these politicians that I'm running against now, they're trying to disassociate.
0.0	0.468028812383	And when I look at Washington today, we need to bring us together.
0.0	0.493440861395	And that's how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America.
0.0	0.435202477591	Do you remember that, everybody?
0.0	0.486592535695	Well, Megyn, let me say at the outset to the men and women of Iowa, thank you for the incredible hospitality over this past year.
0.0	0.456464742694	The sort of genocide and brutality that the victims are suffering, these are not the perpetrators.
0.0	0.439676271087	It's a hard problem.
0.0	0.474221264603	Well, gee, after the last debate, I was told that I didn't smile enough.
0.0	0.494231814355	We both agree that we have to get unaccountable money out of our political system and that we have to do much more to ensure that Wall Street never wrecks main street again.
0.0	0.479186688879	The issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24 months ago.
0.0	0.492917013064	So let's start by knowing where your money is being spent by the federal government.
0.0	0.436066739705	Hillary Clinton cannot be president.
0.0	0.454165606765	I don't recall them calling for his resignation --
0.0	0.467773419296	Well, I don't know if it's a blind trust if Ivanka, Don and Eric run it.
0.0	0.475439023996	Now, on that tariff -- here's what I'm saying, China -- they send their goods and we don't tax it -- they do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.468614365848	It's the people that pull the trigger and we have to find out what is going on.
0.0	0.478883241244	We would still have racism holding people back.
0.0	0.483919672964	And, there is no one on this stage better prepared to prosecute the case against Hillary Clinton than I am.
0.0	0.492818298436	It increases the per child tax credit, because I didn't read about this in a book.
0.0	0.476103676752	You can campaign, or just resign and let someone else take the job.
0.0	0.447446680232	You just want to...
0.0	0.463316025278	I love the Chinese people but they laugh themselves, they can't believe how stupid the American leadership is.
0.0	0.373838660474	No, he doesn't.
0.0	0.432004516905	We don't need that.
0.0	0.450852035963	Because I think everybody has to have some skin in this game, you know.
0.0	0.479165698506	Our average contribution is $27 dollars, I'm very proud of that.
0.0	0.48712942168	And yes, the economy is rigged in favor of those at the top.
0.0	0.46341777174	We need to speak to what unites us as a people; freedom of worship, freedom of religion, freedom of expression.
0.0	0.488852486385	Furthermore, in a competitive global economy, it is imperative that we have the best educated workforce in the world.
0.0	0.381555169719	Who are we kidding?
0.0	0.378100286623	So should the UK, so should France.
0.0	0.408029769081	Check it out.
0.0	0.491934514918	We're going to cut Medicare and Medicaid, federal aid to education to help you, because the government is so terrible.
1.0	0.4829583772	We don't need the federal government to be involved in this at all.
0.0	0.472621964238	Those are the issues that the American people want discussed.
0.0	0.456349881399	And what I'm talking about is not only the covert CIA intelligence, I'm also talking about diplomatic intelligence.
0.0	0.472192345029	But I think on the broader question of religion and politics, you know, I think liberty, itself requires a virtue -- requires a virtuous people.
0.0	0.5	I led the effort, unfortunately unsuccessfully, against deregulation because I knew when you merge large insurance companies and investment banks and commercial banks it was not going to be good.
0.0	0.489957878831	What would motivate me and what would be the guiding light for me in terms of immigration reform, Judy, is to bring families together, not divide them up.
0.0	0.438697249154	Big difference.
0.0	0.460181644653	I'll tell you what else people are concerned about.
0.0	0.427468777651	I don't think so.
0.0	0.450911042108	And I'm not blaming these folks -- well, I guess I could.
0.0	0.48824187593	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.484220489112	You know, I think, again, both of us share the goal of trying to make college affordable for all young Americans.
0.0	0.483437348807	And we can take that message and that formula to Washington to lift every single American to a better life.
0.0	0.432048188336	That's kind of a no-brainer.
1.0	0.572878701568	In this case, our staff did the wrong thing -- they looked a that information.
0.0	0.473739175186	He said, "Yeah, they do it all the time with other people."
0.0	0.459513170279	Are you fed up with how Washington wastes your money?
0.0	0.480137299757	Senator Sanders voted against it at that time.
0.0	0.48826654137	I would give up some Social Security to save a system that Americans are going to depend on now and in the future.
0.0	0.44043179807	And that's a tragedy because now...
0.0	0.5	I think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether it's poison in the water of the children of Flint, or whether it's the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the LGBT community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, that's what I want to take on.
0.0	0.467608817856	It's an important one that we should be engaged in.
0.0	0.487873309392	And, indeed, my tax plan that I've introduced, it's available on our website.
0.0	0.472282541698	It's actually evidence of the bias that exists in the American media today.
0.0	0.489953352039	Detailed plans count, and I believe that the plan I've laid out to destroy ISIS before the tragedies of San Bernardino and Paris are the right ones.
0.0	0.476389800924	I'm not anti-Wall Street, but I don't believe the government ought to wear a team jersey, pick winners and losers.

0.0	0.420484166464	Yes, I apologize.
0.0	0.46050195141	But let me go back to something that's very important.
0.0	0.482979507425	The rest of the world is moving away from us towards other alliances because we are weak.
0.0	0.46181081438	That's a part of the problem and I am going right at them.
0.0	0.488123627624	If you look at history, John, you will find that regime change -- whether it was in the early '50s in Iran, whether it was toppling Salvador Allende in Chile, whether it is overthrowing the government of Guatemala way back when -- these invasions, these toppling of governments, regime changes have unintended consequences.
0.0	0.455633515779	... And that I am not a great fan of regime change.

0.0	0.4860128586	Social Security, which Republicans call a Ponzi scheme, may face privatization.
0.0	0.473082931075	And if you become the nominee, who the hell knows if you can even serve in office?
0.0	0.420213608424	You count on it.
0.0	0.526597510833	That is what we have to do.
0.0	0.462269684298	So yeah, someone who makes more money...
0.0	0.451056099735	So I'm going to come up with the best way forward.
0.0	0.5	Whether it's welfare reform and getting something back for the hard-earned taxpayers; whether it's engaging in Pentagon reform and taking on the big contractors that were charging thousands of dollars for hammers and screw drivers and ripping us off; or whether it's taking on the special interests in the nursing home industry in Ohio, so that mom and dad can have the ability to stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.
0.0	0.476982064839	You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president...
0.0	0.430186840444	It can happen.
0.0	0.475872757969	Guaranteeing that women's work finally gets the pay, the equal pay that we deserve.
1.0	0.505670681237	And by the way, when I left, there were over 1 million fewer people on welfare in New York state than when I took office...
0.0	0.491776939585	We defended the highest median income in the country.
0.0	0.478154316117	Caucus for me on Monday night because if I am your nominee, I will unite this party and I will defeat Hillary Clinton and when I'm president, America's light will shine again and the 21 century will be a new American century.
0.0	0.456870864701	Do senators have the right to disagree with the president?
0.0	0.48826953693	If we reengage and get involved, yeah, we can have health care for all people, we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
1.0	0.584195577495	And in Libya, for example, the United States, Secretary Clinton, as secretary of state, working with some other countries, did get rid of a terrible dictator named Gadhafi.
0.0	0.471810160378	And by the way, I hope we can end the trade embargo with Cuba as well.
0.0	0.46265102878	Marco voted on the other side.
0.0	0.462757197119	It could be people that are going to do great, great destruction.
0.0	0.5	She is disagreeing with FDR on Social Security, LBJ on Medicare and with the vast majority of progressive Democrats in the House and the Senate, who today are fighting to end the disgrace of the United States being the only major country on Earth that doesn't provide paid family and medical leave.
0.0	0.478313242721	It's a country in which people choose to buy guns.
0.0	0.479273792722	This president, this president is more interested in funding -- less interested in funding the military, than he is in funding planned -- he's more interested in funding Planned Parenthood than he is in funding the military.
0.0	0.492512517292	Well, I'll tell you something: you can take everything from the top 1 percent, and you apply it to our fiscal gap, and you won't even make a dent in it.
0.0	0.481244474719	And Mr. Trump has a great capacity to use bluster and bigotry to inflame people and to make think there are easy answers to very complex questions.
1.0	0.481514975736	We are relying on small campaign donors, 750,000 of them, 30 bucks a piece.
0.0	0.46770190608	But the real -- but I think we have to get back to what this election has to be about.
0.0	0.419060854775	No, it's true.
0.0	0.475508552865	My plan would sweep all of them into a regulatory framework so we can try to get ahead of what the next problems might be.
0.0	0.470037217362	Under that theory, not only would I be disqualified, Marco Rubio would be disqualified, Bobby Jindal would be disqualified and, interestingly enough, Donald J. Trump would be disqualified.
0.0	0.473454400012	Carl, are we really talking about getting government involved in fantasy football?
0.0	0.491514804259	You think about it -- this is the president who said, along with his secretary of state -- drew a red line in Syria, said, if Assad uses chemical weapons against his people, that we're going to attack.
1.0	0.598524400271	One candidate said, you know what, I don't think it's a great idea that we sell automatic weapons in this country that are used by the military to kill people very rapidly.
0.0	0.471781257951	So I know Secretary Kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease-fire up as quickly as possible.
0.0	0.5	I believe if we lead an air coalition, which we are now in the position of doing and intensify it, if we continue to build back up the Iraqi army, which has had some recent success in Ramadi, as you know, if we get back talking to the tribal sheiks in Anbar to try to rebuild those relationships, which were very successful, in going after Al Qaida in Iraq, if we get the Turks to pay more attention to ISIS than they're paying to the Kurds, if we do put together the kind of coalition with the specific tasks that I am outlining, I think we can be successful in destroying ISIS.
0.0	0.493084625086	That is why I'm going to have a tax on Wall Street speculation to make certain that public colleges and universities in America are tuition free.
0.0	0.488060134911	I was flattered that Secretary Clinton two months later borrowed so many of my proposals to incorporate into hers.
0.0	0.476578390929	I'm going to prioritize those recipients who need the most help first.
0.0	0.429583064002	They don't like that.
0.0	0.422207733101	And how do I know it?
0.0	0.480577259647	So guns have to be looked at as its own problem, but we also have to figure out how we're going to deal with the radicalization here in the United States.
0.0	0.48031672399	Well, to start with, unlike President Obama, I'll actually name the enemy that we confront.
0.0	0.494225590416	I -- you know, know that Senator Sanders had a different vote than I did when it came to giving immunity to gun makers and sellers.
0.0	0.409009096984	I mean, so don't -- so you can't -- you can't...
0.0	0.5	I know that we are at greater risk today than at any time since then of another attack.
0.0	0.5	We got it done in my state by leading with principal and that's what we need to do as a party for comprehensive gun safety.
0.0	0.461896875564	Why don't we let the process work.
0.0	0.47487132314	(inaudible), the great majority of Republicans and Americans believe in a hopeful future.
0.0	0.472980140542	Bernie Sanders has already said it.
0.0	0.470759714397	Because you realize that people depending on you.
0.0	0.480171844385	We now have a gun on every table.
0.0	0.526597510833	...
0.0	0.4774646139	I say, yes, not only do we give them what they need, but we don't tie their hands behind their backs so that they can go ahead and get the job done.
0.0	0.478742218014	You know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in America.
0.0	0.493574365803	What we have to do right now is bring our people together and understand that we must provide a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people.
0.0	0.491577515716	Secretary Clinton has been going around the country saying Bernie Sanders wants to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, people are going to lose their MedicAid, they're going to lose their CHIP program.
0.0	0.5	In fact, drove down to three of the four lowest years on record police use of lethal force.
0.0	0.476052630399	I have been for the Brady bill, I have been against assault weapons.
0.0	0.482933890345	But it will not be unconstitutional executive orders like the ones Barack Obama has forced on us.
0.0	0.479888511877	The fact is, there's a number of things that the next president is going to have to do to clean up this mess.
0.0	0.481152571003	What we need now is a proven leader who has produced results.
0.0	0.475008677689	So that it will not be a federal crime.
0.0	0.453859449832	I think the issue here is -- and I applaud Secretary Clinton.
0.0	0.509784274891	And I believe I can, because I have a proven record, a record of accomplishment, a record of cutting taxes, of shrinking the government, of reforming education, of challenging the status quo, eliminating career civil service protections, shrinking the government workforce by 11 percent, but leading the nation in job growth.
0.0	0.460823842794	Get over that one, OK?
0.0	0.45204779586	But here's the real key.
1.0	0.397455420523	It's not theirs anymore.
0.0	0.468665956263	We eliminate the payroll tax, we eliminate the Obamacare taxes.
0.0	0.40707678077	(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
1.0	0.5	Nancy, the blueprint in Maryland that we followed was yes, we did in fact raise the sales tax by a penny and we made our public schools the best public schools in America for five years in a row with that investment.

0.0	0.474014889377	We need to move on this consensus that exists in the country.

0.0	0.445714117426	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.490690633599	Are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the Assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire?
0.0	0.401901202335	OK.
0.0	0.456759867448	As you know, because I know you know a lot about health care.
0.0	0.446461956499	We say "we're gonna protect."

0.0	0.430186840444	It can happen.
0.0	0.494094001179	And we would still have governors like Scott Walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions.
0.0	0.485642499457	And then he cut and run because it wasn't popular amongst conservatives, I guess.
0.0	0.5	When you have Wall Street spending $5 billion over a 10-year period to get -- to get deregulated, the only answer they know is break them up, reestablish Glass-Stegall.
0.0	0.416794614527	That's an interesting question.
0.0	0.448448123146	John, may I -- may I interject here?
