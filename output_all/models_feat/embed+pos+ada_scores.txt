0.0	1.0	The government has lied to you and they have stolen from you.
0.0	0.0	And hopefully -- you know, Senator Graham, I -- I know where he's going to be on this, but we use Congress, and we use Congress to cut this funding.
0.0	0.987951807229	I'm very proud of the fact that we have more than 750 thousand donors, and the vast majority of them are giving small contributions.
0.0	0.0480769230769	The only reason why you're doing it now is because we're running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.
0.0	1.0	And if you elect me president, we will bring incredible growth back to this country.
0.0	0.987951807229	I was very honored to be asked to do that and very honored to serve with him those first four years.

0.0	0.0480769230769	Let's talk about our campaigns.
0.0	0.0	There were four dissenters, and they said that they believe the Second Amendment protects no individual right to keep and bear arms whatsoever, which means, if their view prevailed and the next president's going to get one, two, three, maybe four Supreme Court justices, the court will rule that not a single person in this room has any right under the Second Amendment and the government could confiscate your guns.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And why I am a staunch supporter of President Obama's principal accomplishment -- namely the Affordable Care Act -- is because I know how hard it was to get that done.
0.0	0.0	The question was, would you meet with an adversary without conditions?
0.0	1.0	And they came back with 23 recommendations.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I don't like that.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Our decision is, then, do we give them what we need.
0.0	0.0285714285714	I've done it once in Washington, with great jobs and lower taxes.
0.0	1.0	And in fact, Kissinger's actions in Cambodia, when the United States bombed that country, overthrew Prince Sihanouk, created the instability for Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge to come in, who then butchered some 3 million innocent people, one of the worst genocides in the history of the world.
0.0	0.0	I'm totally open to a tariff.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Because if you are, you need to elect someone who's deadly serious about changing this culture.

0.0	0.987951807229	When CEO income has risen 90 percent above the average worker, when the bottom 90 percent of this country's economy has had stagnant wages for the past 40 years, somebody is taking it in the teeth.
0.0	0.0285714285714	Look, here's the deal, in this particular case, the FBI made a mistake.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And that's why, as president, I will look at communities that need special help and try to deliver that.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Well, this goes to the question you were just asking.
0.0	0.0480769230769	We have to lead a coalition that will take back territory from ISIS.
0.0	0.0480769230769	But I agree with Jeb, you can't just do this by growing the economy.
0.0	0.0	Because that person should not have gotten a gun, should not -- would not have passed a background check.
0.0	0.0	We can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports gun control.
0.0	0.0	I'm prepared.
0.0	0.0480769230769	It's what I've done or not done, or it's war.
0.0	0.0	We have gutted our ability to detect the next attack.
0.0	1.0	Every war you can imaging, we have people at each other's throat and our strength is actually in our unity.
1.0	0.0	Think about it: six and a half million people working part-time.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And the problem, Maria, is that the military is not ready, either.
0.0	0.0	We've worked hard our whole life to provide a better family -- a better life for our family.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I'm never going to change my tune.
0.0	1.0	We have a -- they say there's no bipartisanship in Washington?
0.0	1.0	Maria, I'd like to interrupt this debate on the floor of the Senate to actually answer the question you asked, which was on entitlements.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Our country rise up again, but we need to have a compelling conservative agenda that we present to the American people in a way that doesn't disparage people, that unites us around our common purpose.
0.0	0.0	But it was not on a second filing with FDIC and yes, I made a paperwork error disclosing it on one piece of paper instead of the other.
0.0	0.0	And when we -- and when we do that, we don't do what the Republicans want, which is to cut Social Security.
0.0	0.987951807229	It was 25 years ago, and I came by defeating the Democratic incumbent.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Suicide, alcoholism, drugs, that's why we need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country, and not just a handful of billionaires who have enormous economic and political power.
0.0	1.0	He's a left-wing judicial activist, Harvard Law professor who was Al Gore's lawyer in Bush versus Gore.
0.0	0.642857142857	Yeah, we can create 13 million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure at a cost of a trillion dollars.
0.0	1.0	...I'm going to go to Washington to stop it...
0.0	1.0	You had only 21 Republican governors in this country.
0.0	1.0	I've had more calls on that statement that Ted made -- New York is a great place.
0.0	0.0	Or somebody else.
0.0	0.0	I was a governor during the 9/11 attack.

0.0	0.0480769230769	I'm against anything that's bad for my mother.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And I would not stand for that as president of the United States.
0.0	0.0480769230769	It is disgraceful, and in a Christie administration, they would know much, much better than to do that.
0.0	0.987951807229	And it's why I've continued to focus on the fact that we need to declare war on the four big cost drivers because 80 percent of all medical costs in this country are chronic disease.
0.0	0.0	I believe we should be appointing Supreme Court justices who will follow the law and not try to make the law.
0.0	0.0	I chaired the National Commission on Homeland Security Committee for United States.
0.0	1.0	And somebody walked in and shot them, killed them.

0.0	0.0285714285714	They can't -- when they order the product and when they finally get the product it is taxed.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Well I want to comment on this.
0.0	0.0480769230769	But what he's touching -- talking about, I think has got merit.
0.0	0.987951807229	When I was running for senate just about every lobbyist, just about all of the establishment opposed me in the senate race in Texas and my opponent in that race was worth over 200 million dollars.
0.0	0.0	This is the fantasy that I talked about in the beginning.

0.0	0.0	You can't do it with empty promised.
0.0	0.0285714285714	I have a debt to America I'll never repay.
0.0	0.0480769230769	When I am president, I will work consistently every single day to keep this country safe, not call Edward Snowden, as you did, a great public servant.
0.0	0.0	Well, first let me address the tax issue because it's related to the entitlement issue and I want to thank you for holding a substantive debates where we can have debates about these key issues on taxes.
0.0	0.0	You have to have certainty.
0.0	0.0480769230769	We lose with ISIS.
0.0	0.0480769230769	All of those things are important, and all those things would happen in a Christie administration.
0.0	0.0285714285714	But I want to start by helping those people who are most at risk, the ones who, yes, are cutting their pills in half, who don't believe they can make the rent, who are worried about what comes next for them.
0.0	0.0	Kissinger was one of those people during the Vietnam era who talked about the domino theory.
0.0	0.0480769230769	But our goal is, in fact, to try over a period of time to, in fact, deal with our enemies, not just ignore that reality.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And our adversaries continue to grow stronger.
0.0	0.0	Planned Parenthood had better hope that Hillary Clinton wins this election, because I guarantee under President Jindal, January 2017, the Department of Justice and the IRS and everybody else that we can send from the federal government will be going in to Planned Parenthood.

1.0	1.0	Let's not have the most expensive business tax rate in the world.
0.0	0.0480769230769	We need to make the government run smarter and better, and reform this corporate tax system, bring that money back to the United States to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, and we need to use it also to protect our grid from terrorists.
0.0	0.0	I am deadly serious about changing this culture.

0.0	1.0	Yes, I do believe that now after the American people bailed Wall Street out, yes, they should pay a Wall Street speculation tax so that we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.0	Because -- because Donald's mother was born in Scotland.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I don't see a lot of weakness on this stage, quite frankly.
0.0	0.0480769230769	This nation has been great to me, and that's the only way I know to pay you back.
0.0	0.0	It appears that the same someone who has been whispering in old Marco's ear too.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Next, we have to talk to our adversaries, and we have to make sure they understand the limits of our patience.
1.0	1.0	Secondly, I never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
1.0	0.987951807229	You know, I left my medical practice and ran for office because I was concerned about an $18 trillion debt.
0.0	0.0	OK.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Now it is their time to help the middle class.
0.0	0.0	That's why John McCain, even though he was born in Panama, was eligible to run for president.
0.0	0.0480769230769	They were wrong.
0.0	1.0	But what is to prevent a future liberal president or a liberal Congress from coming back and not just raising the income tax, but also raising that VAT tax, and that vat tax is really bad for seniors.
0.0	0.0	But yes, there is more collaboration required between private sector companies and the public sector.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And we don't need a weak person being president of the United State, OK?
0.0	1.0	We got to do a lot about the high cost of high -- higher education, but we've got to make sure we're training people for jobs that exist, that are good jobs that can pay.
0.0	1.0	We're a country of laws, Bill.
0.0	0.6	Are you coming onboard a proposal?
0.0	1.0	This is a great nation.
0.0	0.0	When extraordinarily wealthy people make very large contributions to Super PACs, and in many cases in this campaign, Super PACs have raised more money than individual candidates have, OK?
0.0	0.0	And I have to tell you, that was a very insulting statement that Ted made.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Makes it a whole lot easier for them to want to go somewhere else.
0.0	0.0	...Rand is exactly right.
0.0	1.0	Obama broke every rule of negotiation.
0.0	0.0480769230769	That is a bad deal and an evil situation, and presidents have looked the other way.
0.0	0.0	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I didn't.

0.0	0.0480769230769	He wasn't my senator.

0.0	0.987951807229	You're talking about $2.7 trillion.
0.0	0.0	I was recruited to H.P.
1.0	0.987951807229	We stuck to the fact that Americans are tired of Washington corporate interests and Democrats who are interested in just politics and power and they're looking for someone who's going to fight for them; looking for someone who's going to grow manufacturing sector of our economy, so those 74 percent of Americans who don't have a college degree have a chance to rise again.
0.0	0.0	It is Iran that's the expansionist power.
0.0	0.0	Yes, in my view, the government of a democratic society has a moral responsibility to play a vital role in making sure all of our people have a decent standard of living.
0.0	0.0480769230769	But you haven't asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought I'd get that off my chest if you don't mind.
0.0	0.0	And that problem is too big regulations like the EPA, too much new taxes on business that we have seen and "Obamacare."
0.0	0.0480769230769	And wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong.
0.0	0.0480769230769	The agreement on humanitarian relief now needs to be implemented, because there are enclaves that are literally filled with starving people throughout Syria.
0.0	0.0480769230769	What we ought to do is tighten up our efforts to deal with the entry visa program so that a citizen from Europe, it's harder if they've been traveling to Syria or traveling to these other places where there is Islamic terrorism, make it harder -- make the screening take place.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Well, I want to know, did you win?

0.0	0.0	I talked about Donald Trump from the standpoint of being an individual who was using his celebrity rather than his conservatism.
0.0	0.0	The big Internet companies.
0.0	1.0	Simply expanding Medicaid does not improve health care outcomes.
0.0	0.0	Absolutely.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Because this president has consistently underestimated the threat of ISIS.
0.0	0.0480769230769	...before I go.
0.0	0.0	I know how to do that.
0.0	0.0	In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense.
1.0	0.987951807229	The bad news is, we have 470,000 going out of business every year.
0.0	0.0	I congratulate Secretary of State John Kerry and the president for working on this agreement.
0.0	0.0480769230769	So count me in as somebody who will not be listening to Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.0480769230769	If my memory is correct, I think when we saw children coming from these horrendous, horrendously violent areas of Honduras and neighboring countries, people who are fleeing drug violence and cartel violence, I thought it was a good idea to allow those children to stay in this country.
0.0	0.0	Well, I would begin by reminding people that at this point in previous presidential elections, Jimmy Carter couldn't win, Ronald Reagan couldn't win, Bill Clinton couldn't win, and neither could've Barack Obama.
0.0	1.0	There are a lot of people living paycheck to paycheck in Florida as well, they're looking for a senator that will fight for them each and every day.
0.0	0.0	and they decide, we're going to raise it to 30 percent, plus we're going to raise the income tax to 30 percent.
0.0	1.0	They have infrastructure.
0.0	0.0	And as someone who's worn the uniform of the country, that's how we build our military back up.
0.0	1.0	When I was in Washington, I fought to get the budget balanced.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And where we are right now is we have got to stand up to the Trumps of the world who are trying to divide us up.
0.0	0.0480769230769	That's not even an issue.
0.0	0.0	I had to answer every single question about every single result and every single projection in public until there were no more questions.
0.0	0.0	Effectively it is day trading without any regulation at all.
0.0	1.0	Look, in addition to what Donald was saying is we also need to talk about the legal immigration system for permanent residents.
0.0	0.0	In the first day in office, my first executive order, I revoked every one of the executive orders that he had -- he had enacted over the prior 12 years.
0.0	1.0	We do not have to have massive levels of income and wealth inequality.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I have studied that issue in great detail.
0.0	0.0	The domino theory, you know, if Vietnam goes, China, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.
0.0	0.987951807229	So I not only had the opportunity to go through the Cold War struggles in Central America, and even after 9/11 to be involved.
0.0	0.0	That's why I'm running for office because when I become president of the United States, on my first day in office we are going to repeal every single one of his unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.0	I voted against it because the Southern Poverty Law Center, among other groups, said that the guest-worker programs that were embedded in this agreement were akin to slavery.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And if we try to put everybody in the same -- call everybody the same thing, we can't do it.
0.0	0.0285714285714	I can only say that we both share the goal of universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.0	You know, I listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas.
0.0	1.0	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.0	It's called the mainstream media who every single day...
0.0	1.0	Why didn't they call the police?
0.0	0.987951807229	It's the reason why I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and led the fight to stop the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, because it was clear then, like it's clear now, that border security is national security.
0.0	1.0	We've all been talking about tax reforms tonight, and paying for infrastructure is caught right up in tax reform.
0.0	0.0	I would a whole lot rather had Carly Fiorina over there doing our negotiation than John Kerry.
0.0	0.0	I'm putting up 100 percent of my own money.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I don't think anybody should expand Medicaid.
0.0	1.0	You see what the Saudi's -- deliver them a strong message but at the end of the day we have to keep our cool because most of the time they're going right with us.
0.0	0.0285714285714	I think what President Obama did was to exemplify the importance of this issue as our first African American president, and to address it both from the President's office, and through his advocacy, such as working with young men, and Mrs. Obama's work with young women.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Maria, I assume that I can respond to that.
0.0	0.0	And, PBS, thank you.
0.0	0.0285714285714	We will invest in education, and jobs for our kids, not incarceration and more jails.
0.0	1.0	Every progressive economist who has analyzed that says that the numbers don't add up, and that's a promise that cannot be kept, and it's really important now that we are getting into the rest of the country that both of us are held to account for explaining what we are proposing because, especially with healthcare, this is not about math.
0.0	0.0	Instead, the Washington establishment raised both.
0.0	0.0480769230769	It is.
0.0	0.0	Neil...
0.0	1.0	Get over that one, OK?
0.0	0.0	All we need to do is protect them, they will be in their own country.
0.0	1.0	...incentives for people to keep people healthy, rather than giving the incentives to treat them when they're sick?
0.0	1.0	It's always a solution of the left to create more Government from the Federal Government.
0.0	1.0	I will be the Ronald Reagan if I can find a Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.0	Absolutely, because what we will do is say, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so they're not hanging out on street corners.
0.0	1.0	We're reducing taxes to 15 percent.
0.0	0.0	If an American missionary has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.0480769230769	The age will have to gradually rise, there is no question.
0.0	0.0480769230769	But I feel that the gun-free zones and, you know, when you say that, that's target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill. That's target.
0.0	1.0	And it troubles me that people are rewarded for tearing down our country.
0.0	0.0	But as Bill said earlier, Roe v. Wade, it's has been the law for 42 years, and I don't think we should continue to try to change it.
0.0	0.0	And for the sake of me, I can't figure out which one is which.
0.0	1.0	It will lead to even greater war in this world.
0.0	0.0	Why are there five even bigger Wall Street banks now, instead of the ten we used to have on Wall Street?
0.0	1.0	He has got -- that is why he is on the end.
1.0	0.0	We have 400,000 small businesses forming every year in this country.
0.0	0.0	It is why we have to simplify.
0.0	0.0	Carl, are we really talking about getting government involved in fantasy football?
0.0	0.0480769230769	Just tell them that, you put people in there, we're going to bomb them.
0.0	1.0	We both agree that we have to get unaccountable money out of our political system and that we have to do much more to ensure that Wall Street never wrecks main street again.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And it was with us for months, the smell, the air.
0.0	0.0480769230769	The fact is if we don't address what's costing so much, we can't throw enough money at this.
0.0	0.0480769230769	If they had guns, he wouldn't be around very long.
0.0	0.987951807229	I would say the message that got us the win in Iowa and 10 other states against pretty overwhelming odds, is the message that's going to deliver us in this election.
0.0	0.0480769230769	That is principally an American-led air campaign that we are now engaged in.
0.0	1.0	Yes, the wealthiest people, the top 1.5 percent, will pay more in taxes.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I want to get ahead of those, and that's why I've proposed a much more comprehensive approach to deal with all of these...
0.0	0.0	You got Kuwait and you got Qatar and you got Saudi Arabia.
0.0	0.0	There is no money in the Social Security account.
0.0	1.0	How about talking about the substantive issues the people care about?
0.0	0.0	When we do business with China, they tax us.
0.0	0.0480769230769	That is not right.
0.0	0.0480769230769	But now as I travel the country, people say what I feel.
0.0	0.0480769230769	We need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources, but from sources overseas, that can be a real-time fusion effort to get information where it's needed.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Come on, that's just not -- you scare senior citizens with that.
0.0	0.0	Neil, my name was mentioned as well.
0.0	0.0480769230769	No, not a comic book, and it's not a very nicely asked question the way you say that.
0.0	1.0	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.0285714285714	And we fought for statewide school choice, where the dollars follow the child, instead of the child following the dollars.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I've done it.
0.0	1.0	It's a joke.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Is there going to be any change in the House with new leadership?
0.0	0.0480769230769	No, I said, " I would use -- " they were asking me what to do about North Korea.
0.0	0.987951807229	After that you pay 10 percent as a flat tax going up.
0.0	1.0	We went after companies that were ripping off shareholders.
0.0	1.0	People lost their jobs, their homes, their life savings.
1.0	1.0	And if you tax cuts -- if you cut taxes for corporations, and you cut taxes for individuals, you're going to make things move, particularly the corporate tax, which is the highest, of course, in the -- in the world.
0.0	0.0	John, I'd like to address this?
0.0	0.0	Military action, Maria, would be used when it was absolutely necessary to protect American lives and protect American interests around the world.
0.0	1.0	What we need to do is take the rest of the federal entitlements, not just welfare, but food stamps and Medicaid and housing programs and do the same thing we did with welfare.
0.0	0.0480769230769	You can't just ban all Muslims.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Good at email.
0.0	0.0	And the politicians always say it is so complicated, nobody but a politician can figure it out.
0.0	0.0285714285714	We need to create jobs.
1.0	0.0480769230769	Strong, powerful men, young and people are looking at that and they're saying what's going on?
0.0	0.0	And aligned with a corrupt campaign finance system is a rigged economy.
0.0	0.0	Middle class may notice it when they get to the cash register.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Now, he's doing better.
0.0	0.0	We ought to have politicians who not only have government experience but know how the CEOs and the job creators work.
0.0	0.0	Well, I'll tell you something: you can take everything from the top 1 percent, and you apply it to our fiscal gap, and you won't even make a dent in it.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	1.0	So I'm asking women, I'm asking men, to support me because I'm ready to go into the White House on January 20th, 2017 and get to work on both domestic and foreign policy challenges.
0.0	0.0	We need to take a new approach of taxing -- reforming how we tax, and reforming the regulations in our -- in our country before it's too late.
0.0	0.0	When people go to vote in primaries or caucuses, they are voting not only for the president, they are voting for the commander-in- chief.
0.0	0.0480769230769	You can campaign, or just resign and let someone else take the job.
0.0	0.0	In my world, we'll focus on energy independence and a clean environment.
0.0	0.0480769230769	My parents in this country were able to give me the chance to do all the things they never did.
0.0	0.0	If you send a tie or a shirt made in China into the United States and an American goes to buy it at the store and there's a tariff on it, it gets passed on in the price to price to the consumer.
0.0	1.0	Look, that's who I stand up for.
0.0	0.0	It was the first time we did it since man walked on the moon.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Thank you.
0.0	0.0480769230769	When it comes to ISIS, we will not weaken them, we will not degrade them, we will utterly and completely destroy ISIS
0.0	0.0480769230769	So, it's going to be my responsibility to make sure we move forward to solve these problems that are now out in the open.
0.0	0.0480769230769	So it wasn't just me who opposed it.
1.0	0.987951807229	And, that's with zero percent interest rates.
0.0	1.0	There is a better way to provide health care.
0.0	0.0480769230769	The fact is in New Jersey, what we have done is to make it easier now to get a conceal and carry permit.
1.0	1.0	That's wrong.
0.0	1.0	That's not the America that I've ever known.
1.0	1.0	They were wrong.
0.0	0.0	And when the president of the United States gets out to speak about it, does he support police officers?
0.0	0.0480769230769	The fact of the matter is we the American people are not each other's enemies, it's those people who are trying to divide us who are the enemies.
0.0	0.0	Excuse me, John.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Thank you.
0.0	0.0285714285714	Well Maria, thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the New York Times.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Judy, if I can, there is no question, Secretary Clinton and I are friends, and I have a lot of respect for her, that she has enormous experience in foreign affairs.
0.0	0.0480769230769	It's easier to talk to your friends.
0.0	0.0	We have been talking about it for decades.
0.0	0.0480769230769	If i were the president of the United States, I would go and look at every executive order that exists right now and determine which ones want to be voided, because the president shouldn't be legislating: not through that vehicle or any other.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And that's what this economy needs to -- that's what this debate needs to be about.
0.0	0.0	And we are not England.
0.0	0.0480769230769	This country is running out of time.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Here's the way you need to deal with it.
0.0	0.0480769230769	The terrible, authoritarian, Communist dictatorship he warned us about, now he's urging companies to shut down and move to China.
0.0	0.0	And I took on the drug companies and I took on the insurance companies to try to get us universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Just a little bit.
0.0	1.0	But Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term, and you should be showing up to work.
0.0	0.987951807229	I particularly appreciate the proposal that Congressman Jim Clyburn has -- the 10-20-30 proposal -- to try to spend more federal dollars in communities with persistent generational poverty.
0.0	1.0	Where basically, businesses now will have to pay a tax, both on the money they make, but they also have to pay taxes on the money that they pay their employees.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And I think once I'm in the White House we will have enough political capital to be able to do that.
0.0	0.0480769230769	It's going to happen in this country, there are going to be further attacks.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Bencarson.com -- we will heal, inspire and revive America for our children.

0.0	1.0	I was a child of Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.987951807229	What this campaign is not only about electing someone who has the most progressive agenda, it is about bringing tens of millions of people together to demand that we have a government that represents all of us and not just the 1 percent, who today have so much economic and political power.
0.0	0.0	We need to embed with -- with the Iraqi military.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Here's the thing.
0.0	1.0	And yes, I am angry.

0.0	0.987951807229	Well, let me tell you one thing that I am the only guy: The only guy that has consistently fought the Clinton machine every election I was ever in over the past 26 years.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And, the only way -- no...
0.0	0.0480769230769	And this is what we have to -- I -- I've got to tell you, when wages don't rise -- and they haven't for a lot of families for a number of years -- it's very, very difficult for them.
0.0	0.0480769230769	They've got to quit sponsoring Hezbollah and Hamas.
0.0	0.0	And it's a tax you find in many companies in Europe.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	1.0	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.0285714285714	He might not take my phone call, but he would get the message, and the message is this: Until you open every nuclear and every military facility to full, open, anytime/anywhere, for real, inspections, we are going to make it as difficult as possible for you to move money around the global financial system.
0.0	0.0285714285714	So yes, you're going to hear a lot of talk about tax reform --
0.0	0.0	What you need to do is free up interest rates.
0.0	0.0	He's missing the whole point, that America's leadership in the world is required for peace and stability.
0.0	0.0	If we means test Social Security, it means that the government decides whether or not I deserve it.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I didn't say permanently.
0.0	0.0480769230769	But I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost.
0.0	0.0	Kamatsu (ph) is a tractor company in Japan.
0.0	1.0	Many businessmen want to endorse me.
0.0	0.0	They discussed how -- how hard it is to sell tractors in China, because all the regulatory barriers.
0.0	0.0480769230769	We need to get realistic about this.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And it's something that can be done, and I get questioned about that.
0.0	0.0480769230769	They say, " well, we don't really have control."
0.0	0.0	We need someone with a steady hand being president of the United States.
0.0	0.0285714285714	And then what he did is redefine the role of government.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I think it's a mistake to create new and more expensive entitlement programs when we can't afford the ones we've got today.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.0	Let's quit blaming the people on Social Security.
0.0	1.0	It continues with regulatory reform.
0.0	0.0	I've a bill to fix Social Security.
0.0	0.0	Dynamically.
0.0	0.0480769230769	We need someone to fight for the people.
0.0	0.0	John, I -- if I -- a lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.0	They do not get any credit for their care-taking responsibilities.
0.0	1.0	So what if mass unemployment exists?
0.0	0.0480769230769	Now, the challenge we're seeing today is that the Supreme Court is being converted into some type of political body.
0.0	0.987951807229	When I left the workforce, New York State had been reduced by over 15 percent.
0.0	0.0480769230769	We had Hezbollah.
0.0	1.0	You look at the kind of damage that two people that two people that got married, they were radicalized -- they got married, they killed 15 people in actually 15 -- going to be probably 16 but you look at that and you take a look -- a good strong look and that's what we have.
0.0	0.0	Marco Rubio, why don't you resign?
0.0	0.0	Well, I'm very happy to get a question this early on.
0.0	1.0	I have fully endorsed those.
0.0	0.0480769230769	They are not perfect.
0.0	1.0	And we have to take properly vetted refugees ourselves.
0.0	1.0	-- fix America, this is the formula.
0.0	0.987951807229	All the way back to when Ronald Reagan signed a piece of legislation that basically allowed for amnesty for over 4 million people, and the border is still not secure.
0.0	1.0	Those aren't Iowa values, but this is what we believe in New York."
0.0	0.0480769230769	...
0.0	0.0	I have worked for his re-election.
0.0	0.0	I will tell you this, I will beat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.0	And who can blame them?
0.0	1.0	You will also have to means-test the benefits and declare there's not enough money.
0.0	1.0	Ben Carson, can you do math?
0.0	0.0	... on Larry Tribe.
0.0	0.987951807229	92 percent -- 92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama's first term belonged to women.
0.0	0.0	OK. You know, the Democrats who have the ultimate super PAC, it's called the mainstream media.
0.0	0.0	You know, frankly, I did it in Washington, in Ohio, and I will do it again in Washington, if I'm president, to get this country moving again.
0.0	0.0480769230769	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.0480769230769	So let's support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition.
0.0	1.0	This is the unholy alliance that people need to know about between right and left.
0.0	0.0	Stimulating the economy -- because it's tethered down right now with so many regulations...
0.0	0.0480769230769	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	1.0	We have to go after terrorist networks, predominantly ISIS -- that's not the only one, but let's focus on that for a minute.
0.0	0.0	So let's start by knowing where your money is being spent by the federal government.
0.0	0.987951807229	And I went there, and for 16 years, I fought the insiders and was able to get things done.
0.0	0.0285714285714	The president tried to paint a rosy picture of jobs.
0.0	1.0	We're going to suspend and repeal every executive order, every regulation that cost American jobs and is -- is -- is impacting our freedom.
0.0	0.0480769230769	But I would probably have my children run it with my executives and I wouldn't ever be involved because I wouldn't care about anything but our country, anything.
0.0	0.0480769230769	We differ, however, on a couple of key points.
0.0	0.0	It's their money.
0.0	0.0	To use the Justice Department, as we just saw, they have said they are going to sue Ferguson, that entered into a consent agreement, and then tried to back out.
0.0	0.0	They understand the vulnerabilities we have on the southern border.
0.0	0.0	If you're a farmer, if you're a rancher, if you are small business owner, the death tax is gone.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And when I look at Washington today, we need to bring us together.
0.0	0.0	We're not going to dismantle everything.
0.0	0.987951807229	This is 2016.
0.0	0.0	We're becoming Greece if we don't work together.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Not -- not on that, no.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Well, I would really appreciate that.
0.0	1.0	That's why I ask for your support for president.
0.0	0.6	That is not consistent conservatism, that is political calculation.
1.0	0.0480769230769	It isn't there anymore, Mike.
0.0	0.0480769230769	So, yes, I do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white Americans -- particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have -- you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Oh, well, you know, it just didn't work out for you.
0.0	0.0285714285714	Actually going to do something to help the American worker.
0.0	1.0	... wants to face Donald Trump in the general election.
0.0	0.987951807229	Bring the money -- the $2 trillion -- back to the United States.
0.0	0.0480769230769	But the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, it's to understand what happens the day after.
0.0	0.0	Whose fault is it that Medicare is broken, out of money, that Social Security is broken, out of money?
0.0	0.0	And I ended a federal entitlement.
0.0	0.0	I'm a fighter.
1.0	1.0	I've used it three times, maybe four times.
0.0	0.0	The Democrats can't even come up with one.
0.0	0.987951807229	We need somebody ready to be commander-in-chief on day one, who understands there are no moderates in Iran, they've been killed a long time ago.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Let me say on that...
0.0	0.0480769230769	The second will be to the supreme leader of Iran.
0.0	0.0	It feels different.
0.0	0.0285714285714	I believe that our Constitution protects everybody, regardless of their sexual orientation or any other aspect.
0.0	1.0	One of them being that if you don't have some agreement within the system from states and from families and from students, it's hard to get to where we need to go.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Nobody -- I could stand up here all night.
0.0	0.0480769230769	... who got us out of that...
0.0	0.0	The government ought to wear a striped shirt and just make sure the game...
0.0	0.0480769230769	And sending that signal makes it impossible for us to be serious about taking out ISIS and restoring democracy in Syria.
0.0	0.987951807229	And the only reason we got them back is because we owed them with a stupid deal, $150 billion.
0.0	1.0	This has gone on 50 or 60 years where the United States has been involved in overthrowing governments.
0.0	0.987951807229	We have $2.5 trillion outside of the United States which we want to bring back in.
0.0	1.0	That will be my mission as president.
0.0	0.0	And I also want to recognize the people in that church that showed the grace of God and the grace of forgiveness and the mercy that they showed.
0.0	1.0	They're a scam.
0.0	0.0480769230769	The truth is this, the big problem, we need a leader in Washington who understands how to get something done, not to talk about it, not to propose it, to get it done.
0.0	0.0	...John...
0.0	0.0	Nevertheless, one of the things that I think people don't always understand is how accountable a CEO actually is.
0.0	1.0	Two points.
0.0	0.0285714285714	With a couple of additional tweaks, we know what this will do.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Their kids are having a hard time finding any work at all.
0.0	0.0	As president of the United States, I will be a commander in chief that will have the back of the military.
0.0	0.987951807229	Change the Mexico City policy, not take one dime of taxpayer money to fund abortion organizations overseas, and restore the NSA that's been gutted.
0.0	1.0	Imagine a country where people are lifted out of poverty again.
0.0	0.0	How about we get the government to do what they're supposed to be doing, secure our borders, protect our people, and support American values and American families.
0.0	0.0	That sounds like a long time ago.
0.0	0.0480769230769	You know, the Russians wanted to buy time.
0.0	0.0	But like all of our problems, there isn't a single one that can't be solved with common sense if you remove the ego and the politics.
0.0	1.0	We have to get down to creating a country that's not going to have the kind of problems that we've had with people flying planes into the World Trade Centers, with the -- with the shootings in California, with all the problems all over the world.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And you can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.0	That is absolutely not right.
0.0	1.0	You're going away for a long, long while.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Well, John, I don't really have any weaknesses that I can think of.
0.0	1.0	They need to learn English, adopt our values, roll up their sleeves and get to work.
0.0	1.0	Have you ever disagreed with a president?
0.0	1.0	I've been there 35 times.
0.0	1.0	If you're running for president of the United States and you don't understand that we need more American ground forces in Iraq and that America has to be part of a regional ground force that will go into Syria and destroy ISIL in Syria, then you're not ready to be commander in chief.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Atlantic City has gone bad.
0.0	1.0	Millions of people have high deductibles and co-payments.
0.0	1.0	... the mandates and have a simple flat tax.
0.0	0.0480769230769	The economy was really booming.
0.0	0.987951807229	We have a $19 trillion bipartisan debt and it continues to grow as we borrow money from countries that do not like us to pay for government we cannot afford.
0.0	0.0480769230769	You don't know it, they tax us.
1.0	1.0	We had a $1.4 trillion deficit.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I want to take off from that point and argue the same thing.
1.0	1.0	We pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.
0.0	1.0	President Obama's policing commission came out with some.
0.0	0.0	We now have much more information about what must be done to fix our criminal justice system.
0.0	0.0480769230769	So I don't know if you would call that a weakness, but my wife said "let up."
0.0	0.0285714285714	They're never going to let it happen.
0.0	0.0	And -- and I just want to take this opportunity to say, you know, in the 2012 election, you know, we -- and when I say we, Republicans -- tore themselves apart.
0.0	0.0480769230769	...is paid -- played fairly.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And when they let me down, if they let me down, I never forgive.
0.0	0.0	...One more time, in Ohio, our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.0285714285714	You have regulations -- I mean, come on, they're affecting everybody here, particularly our small businesses.
0.0	0.0	He was kind of a conservative guy in many respects.
0.0	1.0	No, it's true.
0.0	1.0	But this is what you're seeing in the Republican debate that you didn't see in that Democrat debate.
0.0	0.0	And yet when he won, he turned to me, trusting my judgment, my experience, to become secretary of state.
0.0	0.0	And, that's why tonight I'm asking you for your vote.
0.0	0.0285714285714	Well, you're talking about -- yeah.
0.0	1.0	You gotta be creative and imaginative.
0.0	0.0	Not bad.
0.0	1.0	It will create a manufacturing juggernaut in this country.
0.0	0.0480769230769	As far as Mark is concerned, as far as the visas are concerned, if we need people, they have -- it's fine.
0.0	0.0	A brief response.
0.0	0.0	The cybersecurity challenges that we face, this administration failed us completely, completely.
0.0	1.0	I was governor of New York on September 11.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Sometimes it's a complicated situation, but some things are black and white.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And not just green cards.
0.0	0.0285714285714	You have a big lawsuit over your head while you're running.
0.0	0.0285714285714	to save a company.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And that's what we should focus on is the violence in our communities.
0.0	1.0	And at the end of the day, it was the president's decision.
0.0	1.0	It is undermining American democracy.
0.0	1.0	You get, like, three days where you have to show up?
0.0	0.0480769230769	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I say, yes, not only do we give them what they need, but we don't tie their hands behind their backs so that they can go ahead and get the job done.
0.0	0.0	And unlike President Obama, where he refuses even to use the term of what's going on, he can't use the term for whatever reason.
0.0	0.0285714285714	And so everybody needs to discount some of the things you're going to hear in these ads, and discount the -- the back-and-forth here, because every person here is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	1.0	I want to tackle those barriers that stand in the way of too many Americans right now.
0.0	0.0480769230769	It never happens.
0.0	0.0	We can take many of those same procedures, we can apply it to Medicare.
0.0	1.0	But Iran is at the heart of most of the evil that is going on in the Middle East through their proxies.
0.0	0.987951807229	We inherited a system that was set up during World War II; 170 million Americans get health insurance right now through their employers.
0.0	1.0	They are refusing to...
0.0	0.987951807229	Now, the proposal that I have outlined, you know, should be familiar to you, because it is what essentially Barack Obama campaigned on in 2008.
0.0	0.0480769230769	... he's really doing some bad...
0.0	0.0	I was an Army intelligence agent and a veteran during the Cold War, assigned to West Germany.
0.0	0.0285714285714	We can save and preserve and strengthen Social Security by making no changes for seniors, but for younger workers gradually increasing the retirement age, changing the rate of growth so that it matches inflation, and critically allowing younger workers to keep a portion of our tax payments in a personal account that we own, we control them, we can pass on to our kids.
0.0	0.0480769230769	We have the Russians and the Iranians working together, not to fight ISIS, but to prop up Assad.
0.0	1.0	It is a false choice.
0.0	0.0	I looked at the evidence.
1.0	0.0	All that's in that trust fund is a pile of IOUs for money they spent on something else a long time ago.
0.0	0.0	I totally get that.
0.0	1.0	No one here is under FBI investigation.
0.0	0.0480769230769	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.0	They're very concerned about it.
0.0	0.0480769230769	You did.
0.0	0.987951807229	As a matter of fact, if you're Hispanic or African-American in Texas, you have the number one high school graduation rates in America.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And he got nasty.
0.0	0.0	It's the strongest pro-worker immigration plan.
0.0	1.0	And so he undermines the Constitution, and he undermines free enterprise by expanding government, and he betrays our allies and cuts deals with our enemies and guts our military.
0.0	0.0480769230769	We'd rebuild infrastructure that would also create jobs in this country, and we'd work with the states to do it the right way, to do it more efficiently and more effectively.
0.0	0.0	He got endorsed by the Sun-Sentinel because he was the most talented guy in the field.
0.0	0.0	I suspect you may have.
0.0	0.0	I mean, I ask that with all due respect.
0.0	0.0	Every election we talk about this.
0.0	1.0	They will -- some will follow.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And said, well, she said you were angry and I said to myself, huh, she's right.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I think now what I've called for is counsel for every child so that no child has to face any kind of process without someone who speaks and advocates for that child so that the right decision hopefully can be made.
0.0	0.0	I want to -- before my time runs out I want to get back to this issue of ISIS versus Iran.
0.0	1.0	We have a huge mental health problem in this country.
0.0	0.0	That's fine.
0.0	1.0	Just last week, we see saw two Iraqi refugees vetted using the same process the president says will work, that were arrested for being alleged ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I am the man who can bring us together to do that, and I ask for your vote.
0.0	1.0	Spent the first seven years of his life in Fascist Italy, under Benito Mussolini.
0.0	1.0	African-Americans who face discrimination in the job market, education, housing, and the criminal justice system.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And the people in New York fought and fought and fought, and we saw more death, and even the smell of death -- nobody understood it.
0.0	1.0	We have not provided them.
0.0	0.0480769230769	They're working as hard as they ever have, everything costs more, and they haven't had a raise in decades.
0.0	1.0	The result of that, you had the Iranian Revolution coming in, and that is where we are today.
0.0	0.0285714285714	You know, these plans would put us trillions and trillions of dollars in debt.
0.0	0.0285714285714	My point is this.
0.0	0.0	No, absolutely not.
0.0	1.0	And when FDR said, "Yeah, it is," that we're going to use all of the resources that we have to create jobs, to build homes, to feed people, to protect the farmers, we are a nation which if we come together there is nothing that we could not accomplish.
0.0	0.0	Somebody says "I'm a fighter."
0.0	0.0480769230769	And I believe that the best way to do that is to be aggressive, to be principled, but to have the goal of trying to improve relations.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And we need to bring our debt under control, make our economy stronger.
0.0	1.0	Just for the record.
0.0	0.0	I was mentioned in the question.
0.0	0.0	I changed it in New Jersey.
0.0	0.0	If this all works out, I'm happy to consider naming you as V.P.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I'm too agreeable, easy going.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And I'll go back to something that had been mentioned just a few minutes ago.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Well, I've been --
0.0	0.0480769230769	We are trying to bring America together around an agenda that works for working families and the middle class.
0.0	0.987951807229	We have seniors out there who are scared to death because this Congress -- this one that we have right now, just stole $150 billion from the Social Security retirement fund to give it to the Social Security disability fund.
0.0	1.0	We need a ground force in Iraq and Syria, and America has to be part of that ground force.
0.0	0.0	We need to bring people together in Washington.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I have...
0.0	1.0	And that is what they told me when I was in Jordan in November.
0.0	0.987951807229	I have the experience as a prosecutor, attorney general, governor, United States Army intelligence veteran, governor during the 9/11 attack, chairman of the Terrorism Commission for this country.
0.0	0.987951807229	Until we have a president of the United States that gets up every day and goes to the Oval Office with the intent purpose of securing that border, and there's not anybody on either one of these stages that has the experience of dealing with this as I have for over 14 years with that 1200-mile border.
0.0	1.0	My tax plan enables you to fill out your taxes on a postcard so we can abolish the IRS.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And the reasons why I've done is I don't believe we have a good process of being able to vet them.
0.0	1.0	It's why you see Walgreens buying Rite Aid.
0.0	1.0	This was a question on entitlements.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And you know, he's right.
0.0	1.0	No vision at all.
0.0	1.0	This is a group of people that burns people in cages, that is conducting genocide against Christians and Yazidis and others in the region.
0.0	0.0	And if I could say just one thing.
0.0	0.0	But we can do is defund Planned Parenthood, and by the way, put in place an absolute permanent ban on any taxpayer dollars ever being used to fund abortions.
0.0	0.0	And we finally need to tackle the basics to cut this government down to size and hold it accountable.
0.0	0.0	I will not take advice from Henry Kissinger.
0.0	1.0	I am convinced because I see how he works with his attorney general, not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.

0.0	1.0	You know, the Security Council finally got around to adopting a resolution.
0.0	1.0	And there should be some regulation.
1.0	1.0	Well, there's not question that we should be able to look at past president whether they're married to somebody who's running for president or not in terms of their past behavior and what it means.
0.0	0.0	A rich person does not.
0.0	0.0285714285714	Let me start -- I want to get to the substance of the question on jobs, but I want to start with something.
0.0	0.987951807229	Those three things put together are going to give confidence to job creators and you will begin to see wages rise.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And the fact is it was wrong.

0.0	0.0480769230769	... that's what you say in a primary.
0.0	1.0	We have to be honest about it.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I know we can do this because we're still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	1.0	So let's set the facts straight.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I changed that.
0.0	0.0	No, John.
0.0	0.0480769230769	What should we do?
0.0	1.0	So conservatives actually do come out of Manhattan, including William F. Buckley and others, just so you understand.
0.0	1.0	They said they would repeal Obamacare if we gave them the majority.
0.0	1.0	They go to Harvard.
0.0	0.0	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Well, let me -- let me first of all talk a little bit about my experience.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Now, on to your substantive question.
0.0	0.0480769230769	That's an interesting question.
0.0	0.0480769230769	But the leaders have come forward to realize that protest is fine, but violence is wrong.
0.0	0.0480769230769	OK, good.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And they wonder whether somebody is getting something to -- keeping them from getting it.
0.0	0.987951807229	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.0	Not my kind of guy.
0.0	0.0	He has gone to China.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Those are the hard numbers.
0.0	0.0	And that is that one of the things you're watching tonight are 11 quality candidates debating an important issue.
0.0	0.987951807229	My program would move the 104 programs of the federal Department of Education into four block grants, and send them back to the states because income inequality is driven by a lack of skills when kids don't get what they need to be able to compete and win in this country.
0.0	0.0	I voted for comprehensive immigration reform in 2007.
0.0	1.0	We're going to suspend -- I've -- I've said this for four years.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And I was proud to stand with him and support it.
0.0	1.0	... you know, the -- the -- the fact of the matter is -- you know, if we fix the taxation system, make it absolutely fair, and get rid of the incredible regulations -- because every regulation is a tax, it's a -- on goods and services.
0.0	1.0	I like Marco too, and two years ago, he called me a conservative reformer that New Jersey needed.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Because it wouldn't work.
0.0	1.0	You do legislation.
0.0	0.0	In the crowd today is Major General James Livingston, who's the co-chairman of my campaign here in South Carolina, a Medal of Honor recipient.

0.0	1.0	Iran is sponsoring terrorism in many parts of the world, destabilizing areas.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And I ask everyone in America to call Congress tomorrow and say enough is enough; no more debt.
0.0	1.0	I don't think they dropped all the amendments into a hat and picked them out of a hat.
0.0	1.0	A lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.0	And to expand on Mr. Carson's -- or Dr. Carson's question, let's face it, we have laws already.
0.0	0.0	Chris Christie wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.0	We have been debating right here the core difference between conservatism and progressivism.
0.0	0.0	Here's why, the president of the United States and both his attorney's general, they give the benefit of the doubt to the criminal, not to the police officers.
0.0	0.0	I would change them.
0.0	0.0	I think President Obama has set a great example.
0.0	1.0	We're going to bring jobs back from Japan, we're going to bring jobs back from China, we're going to bring, frankly, jobs back from Mexico where, as you probably saw, Nabisco is leaving Chicago with one of their biggest plants, and they're moving it to Mexico.
0.0	0.0	We're going to cut Medicare and Medicaid, federal aid to education to help you, because the government is so terrible.
0.0	0.0	And so it was (inaudible) his statement, which is why I'm asking him to consider changing his views.
1.0	0.0	Becky, if you want a 10 percent flat tax where the numbers add up, I rolled out my tax plan today, you can find it on line at tedcruz.org.
0.0	0.0	People are upset about it.
0.0	1.0	And second, the First Amendment Defense Act, which is protecting religious liberty, if it's not passed by then, which I suspect it won't, because the president will veto it, I will institute an executive order to make sure that people of faith are not being -- not being harassed and persecuted by the federal government for standing up for the religious beliefs.
0.0	1.0	We're going to create a border.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	1.0	He pays on his personal rate, and he is paying higher than the big dry-cleaning chain down the street, because he's paying at his personal rate.
0.0	0.0	The FCC jumping in now and saying, "we're going to put 400 pages of regulation over the Internet," is going to create massive problems.
0.0	0.987951807229	You know, 200 years ago, America was founded on this powerful principle that our rights don't come from government.
0.0	0.0	What I said was that I think that Dr. Carson's ideas are good ideas.
1.0	1.0	We have the world's best military, even though he's done everything he can to diminish it.
0.0	1.0	Now, let me ask you a question everybody, and, this is for the guy, you know, who owns a landscaping business out there.
0.0	0.0480769230769	But I have no argument with anyone making up her mind about who to support.
0.0	1.0	As far as the wall is concerned, we're going to build a wall.
1.0	1.0	I vetoed a statewide I.D. system for gun owners and I pardoned, six out-of-state folks who came through our state and were arrested for owning a gun legally in another state so they never have to face charges.
0.0	0.0	You see, folks, this is how socialism starts.
0.0	0.0	I'm not going to have something that Ted described in his tax plan.
0.0	0.0480769230769	No, it speaks to the fact that I don't know those --
0.0	1.0	I choose him as my vice presidential candidate, and the Democrats sue because we can't take him along for the ride.
0.0	1.0	We eliminate the payroll tax, we eliminate the Obamacare taxes.
0.0	0.0	I'm tired of the hyphenated Americans and the division.
0.0	0.0	We need all of them to be part of exactly what the first George Bush put together in the first Gulf War.
0.0	0.0480769230769	See, here's the thing.
0.0	0.0	I am not a member of the political class.
0.0	0.0	So I'm doing great.
0.0	1.0	So, I would pass legislation outlawing abortion after 20 weeks.
0.0	0.0285714285714	You're simply not.
0.0	1.0	We elected a president that is weakening America on the global stage.
0.0	0.0	A politician other than the people in the states -- I don't want to -- a politician cannot get them to pay.
0.0	0.0480769230769	You know, she only had a third-grade education, but -- you know, she knew how to stretch a dollar.
0.0	1.0	That's my view.
0.0	0.0	You know, we have a war on virtual everything -- race wars, gender wars, income wars, religious wars, age wars.
1.0	0.987951807229	It says that after 35 million people have come here over the last 20 years, almost all of whom are unskilled workers, flattening wages, creating horrible opportunity -- a lack of opportunities for unskilled workers, we're going to do something about reducing the level of immigration by 25 percent.
0.0	1.0	I think it is fair to say, whatever the complaints that you want to make about him are, that with respect to China, one of the most challenging relationships we have, his opening up China and his ongoing relationships with the leaders of China is an incredibly useful relationship for the United States of America.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you had better get rid of the super PACs, because they're causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that are being made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.0	Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns.
0.0	0.0285714285714	But the reason America is a great country, the reason is because our compassion is in our laws.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Let me just say this.
0.0	1.0	But in addition to that, we have to have fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.987951807229	You know, the NASDAQ dropped 80 percent -- 80 percent -- and it took 15 years for the NASDAQ to recover.
0.0	0.0480769230769	See when you're a senator, what you get to do is just talk and talk and talk.
0.0	0.0480769230769	It's not working.
0.0	0.0	They pay tax once overseas.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Our best days are in front of us.
0.0	1.0	He's a gifted politician.
0.0	0.0	As a result of his efforts and the efforts of Joe Biden against unprecedented, I was there in the Senate, unprecedented Republican obstructionism, we have made enormous progress.
0.0	0.0480769230769	What we need to do is destroy their ability to attack us here over there, and then get out.
0.0	1.0	And the entire New York times attack -- is that I disclosed that loan on one filing with the United States Senate, that was a public filing.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I don't think anybody has cut that much government anywhere, at any time.
0.0	0.0	The only way to figure that out is to go back to getting the intelligence community the funding and the tools that it needs to be able to keep America safe.
0.0	0.987951807229	If we want to create jobs for the folks that you're talking about, who are having trouble getting off government benefits, primarily because of their low skill level, there is no better way -- it's worked for 100 years in America -- putting people back to work in manufacturing is it.
0.0	1.0	There's nobody out there looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.0	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.0285714285714	You're not going to even allow them to come to our country?
0.0	1.0	That is not protected free speech.
0.0	0.987951807229	As you've indicated, what is happening in Syria, the number of people, the hundreds of thousands of people who have been killed -- men, women, 20,000 children, the people who are forced to flee their own country -- their own country -- it is unspeakable.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I think he's tapped into an anger that people feel.
0.0	1.0	The statistics from Wisconsin are particularly troubling, because it is the highest rate of incarceration for African-Americans in our nation, twice the national average.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Community has to understand that that police officer wants to get home at night, and not -- not to lose their life.
0.0	0.0	I'll say this.
0.0	1.0	I have a slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially.
0.0	0.0	You know why three?
0.0	0.0	I've had the growth code (ph) there for about five years, and it's this specific program.
0.0	1.0	She admitted she had sent e-mails to her family saying, "Hey, this attack at Benghazi was caused by Al Qaida-like elements."
0.0	0.0480769230769	That is what I believe.
0.0	0.0	They told you that your Social Security money is in a trust fund.
0.0	0.0	You get the Senate.
0.0	0.0	These are drags on the economy, it's a deliberate drag.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Most importantly, I think I understand leadership, which sometimes requires a tough call in a tough time.
0.0	0.0480769230769	It's not that complicated actually.
0.0	0.0285714285714	If I'm president of the United States and Congress tries to cut the military, I will veto that in a millisecond.
0.0	1.0	When millions of Americans rose up against Obamacare, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	1.0	Corporate inversion is one of the biggest problems we have.
0.0	0.0	And that's why we have to use Carl (ph) and we have to use our great businesspeople and not political hacks to negotiate with these guys.
0.0	0.0480769230769	The natural next question is who actually has done so.
0.0	0.0285714285714	They're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.0	And I want to make this our government.
0.0	0.987951807229	I would not place one American life at risk unless it was absolutely necessary.
0.0	0.0	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.0	And let me tell you, ISIS and terrorists do not get their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And everything is costing more money, and we are killing our -- our -- our people like this.
0.0	0.0285714285714	And I said, "well, if he wanted to play a song, maybe he could play, 'New York, New York'?"
0.0	1.0	The contrast with the Democratic debate, where every fawning question from the media was, "Which of you is more handsome and why?"
0.0	0.0	And let me make a final point on this.
1.0	1.0	First of all, I didn't support Sonia Sotomayor.
0.0	0.0	It's all about getting people to listen to one another's problems.
0.0	0.0	The idea of 401(k)s. I have a small business that I set up.
0.0	1.0	It's like a tariff, but here's the difference: if we impose a tariff, China responds.
0.0	0.0480769230769	But you know, we don't want to put everybody in the same category.
0.0	1.0	At that particular point in time, then Americans will believe that Washington is up to a conversation to deal with the millions of people that are here illegally, but not until.
0.0	0.0	And we're letting them get away with it and we can't let them get away with it.
0.0	0.0285714285714	We're going to be actually out there trying to create a better life for hard-working Americans.
0.0	0.0285714285714	Oh yeah, we want to elect a good president, but America is great from the bottom-up, and the bottom-up is us in our families, in our communities, in our neighborhoods.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I happen to believe that Putin is doing what he is doing because his economy is increasingly in shambles and he's trying to rally his people in support of him.
0.0	0.0480769230769	A terrible sight.
0.0	0.0	For example, all right, who in America denies that we have an infrastructure that is crumbling?
0.0	0.0285714285714	Eradicate those and you fix Medicare and you've fixed America, its economy and you've made people's lives a heck of a lot better.
0.0	1.0	That's the establishment telling us to hide our conservative principles to get the left and the media to like us.
0.0	1.0	I am a 2nd amendment person.
0.0	0.0	The Children's Health Insurance Program, which I helped to create, which covers 8 million kids, is also a different kind of program.
0.0	0.0285714285714	You know, I think, again, both of us share the goal of trying to make college affordable for all young Americans.
0.0	1.0	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	1.0	Make our streets safe again.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Not armies massively marching on each other and air forces, but now we have dirty bombs and we have cyber attacks and we have people who will be attacking our electrical grid.
0.0	0.0285714285714	Putting Iranian troops right on the border of the Golan right next to Israel would be a nonstarter for me.
0.0	0.0480769230769	It is a real horror.
0.0	1.0	We have to put more money.
0.0	0.0	And when you do that, when you're in a position of managing regulations; when you reduce taxes; and when you have fiscal discipline, you see the job creators begin to get very comfortable with the fact that they can invest.
0.0	0.0	It requires tax cuts, because that sends a message to the job creators that things are headed the right way.
0.0	0.0	Meantime, wages have stagnated for 40 years.
0.0	0.0	Half of American seniors would be in poverty without a Social Security check.
0.0	0.0480769230769	This issue is not about that anymore.
0.0	0.0	We ought to give them a little bit of a liability release so that they share data amongst themselves and share data with the federal government, they're not fearful of a lawsuit.
0.0	0.0	You know, after 9/11, one of the efforts that we did in New York was if you see something or hear something suspicious, report it.
1.0	0.0	It's not theirs anymore.
0.0	0.0480769230769	It is Hillary, it is Biden, it is the others who insist on allowing abortion well into viable (inaudible) wrong, and that should be stopped.
0.0	0.0	This is not entitlement, it's not welfare.
1.0	1.0	I never filed for bankruptcy.
0.0	0.0	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.0	So we have a good group of people.
0.0	0.642857142857	We don't need the Federal Government to be involved in this, because when they do we create a $1.2 trillion debt.
0.0	0.0	The first impulse of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton is to take rights away from law- abiding citizens.
0.0	1.0	It seems to me that given our history as a nation that has been a beacon of hope for the oppressed, for the downtrodden, that I very strongly disagree with those Republican candidates who say, you know what, we've got to turn our backs on women and children who left their home with nothing, nothing at all.
0.0	0.0	Bipartisan issue.
0.0	0.0	You know, we didn't start out four years ago at the top of the heap.
0.0	0.0480769230769	You've got to bring people together.
0.0	0.0	Play by the rules.
0.0	0.0	The chances of any litigation proceeding and succeeding on this are zero.
0.0	0.0	Our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I'm very angry because our country is being run horribly and I will gladly accept the mantle of anger.
0.0	1.0	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.0	And that's why I think these ideas up here are great, and that's what we should have is have more discussions like this and less gotcha.
0.0	0.0	They're a mile away from here.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And you think about the reasons that we're having such difficulty right now with our job market.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And sadly, in America today, in our economy, a whole lot of those poor people are African-American.
0.0	1.0	I hope the Supreme Court upholds them.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And as president I would expand enormous energy, literally call every member of Congress that I thought I could persuade.
0.0	1.0	And that's why this study, which shows that if you can believe it today, for white working class people between 45 and 54, life expectancy is actually going down.
0.0	0.0	And he allows states to go ahead and do whatever they want on a substance that's illegal.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Target the efforts for people that are committing crimes with guns, and if you do that, and get it right, you're going to be much better off than creating a political argument where there's a big divide.
0.0	0.0285714285714	But I promise you, in the state of South Carolina, they do.
0.0	1.0	The second thing I said is we need to add reforms, not just increase the numbers, but add reforms.
0.0	0.0480769230769	So I just truly, with all my heart belief, I like everybody on the stage.
0.0	0.0480769230769	... the best results, wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.0	I think our country is tired of the politicians who simply read the polls and fail to lead.
0.0	0.0285714285714	I'm also going to take a bottle of White-Out with me to get started on all those executive orders that Mr. Obama has put his name to.
0.0	0.0	The answer is yes.
0.0	1.0	... tariffs that come against us.
0.0	0.0	They explode the bomb, we have an electromagnetic pulse.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Let me just -- just say this.
0.0	0.0	That we work with allies around the world to protect democratic values.
0.0	1.0	No criminal records for them.
0.0	0.0	First of all, Nikki this afternoon said I'm a friend of hers.
0.0	0.0480769230769	The matter is what orders exist now that shouldn't exist?
0.0	1.0	We need to break the Washington cartel, and the only way to do it is to end all the subsidies and all...
0.0	0.0285714285714	If you listen to the State of the Union the other night, he described them as a bunch of guys with long beards on the back of a pickup truck.
0.0	0.0	You once had a pension.
0.0	0.987951807229	On top of that, there is a business flat tax of 16 percent.
0.0	0.0480769230769	No.
0.0	0.0	OK.
0.0	1.0	But we're not gambling.
0.0	1.0	And if we can do that in Texas, that 12th largest economy in the world, we can do it in America.
0.0	1.0	I think he has addressed a lot of these issues that have been quite difficult, but he has gone forward.
0.0	0.987951807229	One, with respect to the Central American children, I made it very clear that those children needed to be processed appropriately, but we also had to send a message to families and communities in Central America not to send their children on this dangerous journey in the hands of smugglers.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Here's a fact.
0.0	1.0	And we're going to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	0.0	You opposed him then.
0.0	1.0	And when we talk about Wall Street, let's talk about Wall Street.
0.0	1.0	Manufacturing will flow back into this country.
0.0	1.0	Recognize that the caliphate is what gives them the legitimacy to go out on a jihadist mission, so we need to take that away from them.
0.0	0.0	So when Nikki said that, I wasn't offended.
0.0	0.0	Any connection maybe to the fact that our people pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs?
0.0	0.0480769230769	They know we will be committed to victory.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And they must be part of our coalition to destroy ISIS and I believe we can get that done.
0.0	1.0	I actually have a plan.
0.0	1.0	First of all, Ohio does have an energy industry, but we're diversified.
0.0	0.987951807229	That, I think, between the two of us demonstrates the strength of the support we have among people who want to see change in our country.
0.0	0.0480769230769	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	1.0	The number of women --
0.0	1.0	We need to lead a force, a Sunni led force inside of Syria.
0.0	0.0	We're going to have a big, fat beautiful door right in the middle of the wall.
0.0	0.0480769230769	That's the truth of the matter and you see it every time with this president.
0.0	0.0285714285714	I look at Washington, and I hear the talk, and I see the promises and it seems nothing ever changes.
0.0	0.642857142857	I went into Ohio where we had an $8 billion hole and now we have a $2 billion surplus.
0.0	1.0	And the same goes for overseas, where we have to put together a coalition of Muslim nations.
1.0	1.0	Nobody knows who Mossadegh was, democratically-elected prime minister of Iran.
0.0	1.0	And the fact is that that's not a democracy.
0.0	1.0	Our waste water plants, our rail, our airports, in many places are disintegrating.
0.0	0.0480769230769	In this administration, every weapon system has been gutted, in this administration, the force levels are going down to a level where we can't even project force.
0.0	0.0	Let me give you one quick example.
0.0	0.0480769230769	MACCALLUM: Thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.0	I just left Indonesia -- bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb.
0.0	1.0	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the Constitution.
0.0	0.0	I do not see -- want to see one parent or loved one worrying about getting a call in the middle of the night.
0.0	0.0	But let's not -- but let's not -- let's not insult -- let's not insult the intelligence of the American people.
0.0	1.0	You know, in recent travels around this country, I've encountered so many Americans who are discouraged and angry as they watch our freedom, our security and the American dream slipping away under an unresponsive government that is populated by bureaucrats and special interest groups.
0.0	1.0	It's true.
0.0	0.0	In terms of 2007 immigration reform, yeah, I did vote against it.
0.0	1.0	The choice between a weak economy and a strong environment is a false choice, that is not the choice I'll offer America.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I think that sets us apart from a lot of what's happening right now on the Republican side.
1.0	1.0	We're spending $80 billion a year locking up fellow Americans.
0.0	0.0285714285714	I think America can only live up to its potential when we make sure that every American has a chance to live up to his or her potential.
0.0	0.0	Let me tell you who Larry Tribe is.
0.0	1.0	We are at 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And here's an area where Secretary Clinton and I believe we have a difference.
0.0	1.0	And in that interview, he explained his views on a whole host of issues that were very, very different from the views he's describing now.
0.0	0.0	Because of all the federal mandates and federal laws, it was too expensive.
1.0	1.0	This president is undermining our military.
1.0	1.0	Who denies that real unemployment today, including those who have given up looking for work and are working part-time is close to 10 percent?
0.0	0.0285714285714	Governor Huckabee's exactly right, we need to honor the promises made to our seniors, but for younger workers -- look.
0.0	0.0	I know the Democrats have the ultimate SuperPac.
0.0	1.0	Former elected prosecutor, attorney general, governor, I was elected to all of those offices.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I think what we need is a commander in chief who is focused like a laser on keeping this country safe and on defeating radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.0	Mine gives every American a simple, flat tax of 10 percent.
0.0	0.0	She was naturalized.
0.0	0.0	And it is now being put into place everyplace across the state of Ohio.
0.0	0.0	You know how much money we spent on polio last year in America?
0.0	0.0	We also need a nominee, a candidate who will endorse our own principles.
0.0	1.0	The Kurds have been asking us to arm them for three years.
0.0	0.0	I'll tell you, in my family there are a lot of single moms in my family.
0.0	0.0	I certainly agree with FDR for all the reasons Senator Sanders said.
0.0	0.0480769230769	But I think there has to be recognition that if we -- if we are too punitive, then you'll go to other -- other technology companies outside the United States.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And you had better get rid of them, because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Now, since September, the Constitution hasn't changed.
0.0	0.0	Then you have to get rid of Larry Kudlow, who sits on your panel, who's a great guy, who came out the other day and said, I love Trump's tax plan.
0.0	0.0285714285714	I'm interested in making sure we get the maximum amount of revenue from those who can well afford to provide it.
0.0	0.0	I think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether it's poison in the water of the children of Flint, or whether it's the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the LGBT community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, that's what I want to take on.
0.0	0.0	Donald, Donald -- can I -- I hope you reconsider this, because this policy is a policy that makes it impossible to build the coalition necessary to take out ISIS.
0.0	0.0	They don't care about American workers, they just care about bringing as many people in so they can get as many votes as they can.
0.0	0.0	I got the briefings.
0.0	0.0	Well, first of all the -- the plan gives people the option of -- of opting out.
0.0	0.0480769230769	When it comes to fossil fuels, we're going to find more here and use less.
0.0	0.0480769230769	We're gutting our military, and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were.
0.0	1.0	It shifts it to the business, and it would allow middle class people to get a tax cut.
0.0	1.0	And it's not the folks on Wall Street.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Now, we're going to blame the people.
0.0	0.0	White people?
0.0	1.0	Do we still have standards?
0.0	0.0	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	1.0	She is still defending Planned Parenthood, and she is still her party's frontrunner.
0.0	0.0	And so Senator Graham is right about this.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.0480769230769	You've got to give people hope.
0.0	0.0285714285714	And I'm going to do everything I can to address distressed communities, whether they are communities of color, whether they are white communities, whether they are in any part of our country.
0.0	0.987951807229	John, listen, let's keep in mind that for one-third of the 60 million Americans on Social Security it represents 90 percent of their income.
0.0	1.0	And here's the last piece...
0.0	0.0480769230769	The simple fact is that the world has been torn asunder.
0.0	0.0	I think the times are much more serious.
0.0	1.0	But we have to restore policing that will actually protect the communities that police officers are sworn to protect.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point?
1.0	1.0	And let us be clear that every proposal that I have introduced has been paid for.
0.0	0.0	They get them on the black market.
0.0	0.987951807229	We'll tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money.
0.0	1.0	Thousands of thousands -- you look at the number of companies and the number in terms of manufacturing of plans that we've lost -- 50,000 because of China.
0.0	0.987951807229	If I could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited.
0.0	1.0	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, it is demonstrably true...
0.0	0.0	And what we want to do is to control this.
0.0	0.0480769230769	You target the bad guys.
0.0	1.0	Well, I would suggest a fair tax system, and that's what we have proposed.
0.0	0.987951807229	So what we have tried to do and what President Obama succeeded in doing was to build on the health care system we have, get us to 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.0	...10% flat rate...
0.0	0.0480769230769	The reason I did so well last time is not just because of the vision, it's because I have a track record in Washington, D.C. of getting things done.
0.0	0.0480769230769	We will arm and train the Kurds.
0.0	0.0	I am a little skeptical about your governor actually caring enough about higher education to make any kind of commitment like that.
0.0	0.0	They're looking -- they're recruiting people that enter this country as doctors and engineers and even fiances.
0.0	0.0	The billionaire and the working man, no hedge fund manager pays less than his secretary.
0.0	1.0	The New York Times a few weeks back had a columnist who wrote a column saying, "Anybody But Cruz."
0.0	0.0480769230769	And when you do that, you will be amazed at how much progress you can make, and how much healing we can have.
0.0	0.0	Ours was intended to be a citizen government.
0.0	0.0480769230769	We do that, this country would be safe and secure again not only from criminals but from the terrorist who threaten us as well.
0.0	1.0	There is a war against ISIS, not just against ISIS but against radical jihadists terrorists, and it is a war that they win or we win.
0.0	0.987951807229	We've cut 26 percent of our budget.
0.0	0.0	I'm too trusting.
0.0	0.0	It's not my PAC.
0.0	0.0	My mother is on Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.0	I agree with them.
0.0	0.0	The law itself requires a background check, but that didn't fulfill their part of the bargain within the time that they were supposed to do.
0.0	0.987951807229	And, it turns out that up until -- and this has blown me away, never in a million years would I have believed that I would be standing here tonight telling you that we have received three and a half million individual contributions from well over a million people.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And by the way, I hope we can end the trade embargo with Cuba as well.
0.0	0.0	We feel like we're being left behind and left out.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I believe in the PTT because it's important those countries in Asia are interfacing against China.
0.0	0.0	Helping business make profits.
0.0	0.642857142857	So yes, I will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year pay zero, zero in federal income tax.
1.0	1.0	And yet they are seeing almost all new income and all new wealth going to the top 1 percent.
0.0	0.0	Because of a series of disastrous trade policies which have allowed corporate America through NAFTA and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, Secretary Clinton and I disagree on those issues.
0.0	1.0	But the voters are savvier than that.
0.0	1.0	But if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things, including corporate taxes, and including the capital gains taxes, you make that amount up pretty quickly.
0.0	0.0	Every one of us is gifted by God, whether it is those poor babies being picked over or it's someone whose life is tangled up in a web of dependence.
0.0	0.0	Anybody who tells me that we need every penny and every one of those is in a fantasy world.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Appreciate it.
0.0	0.0480769230769	They can have it anyway you want.
0.0	0.0	That is absolutely inaccurate.
1.0	1.0	Twenty-nine million people have no health insurance today in America.
0.0	1.0	Why in God's name does Wall Street...
0.0	1.0	And in fact, in Obama administration, we did not meet with anybody without conditions.
0.0	0.0	If you just cut their income tax, there isn't much income tax to cut.
0.0	1.0	We're going to take the political handcuffs off the military.
0.0	0.0480769230769	...Thank you.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Right.
0.0	0.0285714285714	We need somebody who can balance budgets, cut taxes...
0.0	1.0	We will win on everything we do.
0.0	0.0285714285714	You spend the money today and then you hope you're going to save money tomorrow.
0.0	0.0	And that's what I hear from some people, "we'll do nothing and it will just be fixed."
0.0	0.0	And this summer, we didn't do that.
0.0	1.0	When millions of Americans rose up against amnesty, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	1.0	Under that theory, not only would I be disqualified, Marco Rubio would be disqualified, Bobby Jindal would be disqualified and, interestingly enough, Donald J. Trump would be disqualified.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Bill, here's the interesting position on this.
0.0	0.0	Ever.
0.0	0.0	All I'm saying is our next president has to be someone that undoes the damage Barack Obama has done to this country.
0.0	0.0285714285714	If you can encrypt messages, ISIS can, over these platforms, and we have no ability to have a cooperative relationship --
0.0	0.0	My sister was a single mom, both of my aunts who were a single moms.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I want to speak to all our fighting men and women.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Also, when you look at these videos, they are horrific and show just a hideous disrespect for life.
0.0	0.0	..."diabetes, heart disease, cancer and Alzheimer's?"
0.0	0.0	That's why we embraced free enterprise, and it made us the most prosperous people in the history of the world.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I mean, what we had was something the government made -- basically a bag of gas -- that cut loose, destroyed everything in its path, left thousands of people powerless, but they couldn't get rid of it because we had too much money invested in it, so we had to keep it.
0.0	0.987951807229	And nobody, nobody on either one of these stages has done more than I've done and the people of the State of Texas to deal with securing that border.
0.0	1.0	They're protectionist.
0.0	0.0	And I'm not blaming these folks -- but I guess I could.
0.0	1.0	Marco stood with Chuck Schumer and Barack Obama on amnesty.
0.0	0.0480769230769	That is...
0.0	1.0	And I would note the Senate just a few weeks ago voted to suspend refugees from Middle Eastern countries.
0.0	0.0	Here's the thing that I would ask Donald Trump in all seriousness.
1.0	1.0	Third, if you look at my record as governor of New Jersey, I have vetoed a 50-caliber rifle ban.
0.0	0.0	Community banks are going out of business.
0.0	0.0	They hit us with a cyberattack simultaneously and dirty bombs.
0.0	0.0	I will tell you, you could win a bet at a bar tonight, since we're talking about fantasy football, if you ask who the top three states in America are that produce solar energy: California and Arizona are easy, but number three is New Jersey.
0.0	1.0	It was a big insurance company, AIG.
0.0	0.0480769230769	So, we have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.0	He just writes out an executive order.
0.0	1.0	They have got to quit trying to ship rockets into Gaza that can be used against Israel.
1.0	1.0	Under longstanding U.S. law, the child of a U.S. citizen born abroad is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.0	I would sign an executive order protecting religious liberty, our first amendment rights, so Christian business owners and individuals don't face discrimination for having a traditional view of marriage.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I think, though, government is too big now.
0.0	0.0	So you know what?
0.0	0.0285714285714	We can put America back on track on a growth level and a growth rate that we've never seen in the history of this country.
0.0	0.0	There's a reason Gun Owners of America has endorsed me in this race.
0.0	0.0480769230769	You know, America doesn't owe me anything.
0.0	0.0	Check it out.
0.0	0.0	Let's start with immigration and have a little bit of clarity.
0.0	1.0	Well, as you know, I'm a former elected prosecutor, a former elected attorney general, trained at the University of Virginia in constitutional law, and I don't believe in litmus tests except this.
0.0	0.0	Folks, you want to --
0.0	1.0	I'm going to be introducing a plan which I call the 2020 Perfect Vision for America.
0.0	0.0	We've laid out a national energy plan that says that we should invest in all types of energy.
0.0	0.0	You know, we have to stop this because, you know, if we manage to damage ourselves, and we lose the next election, and a progressive gets in there and they get two or three Supreme Court picks, this nation is over as we know it.
0.0	0.0	Maybe it's because I hadn't given money to the foundation or donated to his wife's Senate campaign.
0.0	0.0	Fiscal discipline, know what you're doing.
0.0	0.0	We've been the most pro-life state six years in a row.
0.0	0.987951807229	I think the last eight years in the private sector have allowed me to see government from the outside, and I think that is a positive thing.
0.0	1.0	The isolationist is the one who wants to continue to follow a foreign policy that has fewer democracies today than when Barack Obama came into office around the world.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I've lived my whole life fighting -- fighting for things that I believe in, fighting for justice and to protect people from crime and terrorism, fighting to stand up for folks who have not had enough and need an opportunity to get more, and to stand up and fight against the special interests.
0.0	0.987951807229	And there are 48 million people involved -- 40 million, 65 and over, and 8 million other.
0.0	0.0480769230769	So why are the pharmaceutical companies consolidating?
0.0	0.0	We should reimpose sanctions, they've already violated sanctions after this agreement was signed by testing medium-range missiles.
0.0	0.0480769230769	All right, look, this has been a great debate.
0.0	0.0	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.0480769230769	Right.
0.0	0.0285714285714	That's what they're doing.
0.0	0.0	But in 2015, we have a very different economy.
0.0	0.0285714285714	I think we're on the verge of the greatest time, and I want to fix the things to let people rise up.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I think the times are different now.
0.0	0.987951807229	And if you make $40,000 a year, a family of four, you don't pay any income tax at all.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.0	I can't speak for the Koch Brothers, you're referring to a Super PAC that we don't coordinate with, that was set up to support President Obama, that has now decided that they want to support me.
0.0	0.0480769230769	We had Hamas.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And we're talking about fantasy football?
0.0	0.987951807229	This is one of the areas I've disagreed with Senator Sanders on, who has called for Iranian troops trying to end civil war in Syria, which I think would be a grave mistake.
0.0	0.987951807229	Now, I for seven years was the U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I will, with your help and support, lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.0	Oh, I'll talk about that, too.
0.0	0.0	The men and women on this stage have more ideas, more experience, more common sense than every participant in the Democratic debate.
0.0	1.0	Right now, corporations, by the thousands, are thinking of leaving our country with the jobs -- leave them behind.
0.0	0.0480769230769	You don't have to say that.
1.0	1.0	He voted in favor of regime change with Libya, voted in favor of the Security Council being an active participate in setting the parameters for what we would do, which of course we followed through on.
0.0	0.0	Sometimes it's because the Federal Reserve kept interest rates so low that the wealthy were able to invest in -- in strong assets like the stock market when everybody else was left behind.
0.0	0.987951807229	I'm 44 years old.
0.0	0.987951807229	Let me just say, if you're talking about an $18 trillion economy, you're talking about a 15 percent tax on your gross domestic product.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Our country doesn't win anymore.
0.0	0.0	They're making a half, two-thirds what they used to make.
0.0	0.0480769230769	You want me to answer that question?
0.0	0.0	They are employing themselves, they are potentially employing others.
0.0	0.0	And wherever you are sitting Nikki, I'm a friend.
0.0	0.0480769230769	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	1.0	We're going to lose Social Security and Medicare if Republicans and Democrats do not come together and find a solution like Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.0	So you might not.
0.0	0.0480769230769	That's the side we need to be on, and that's the side of the bulk of the -- of the Middle East.
1.0	0.987951807229	Not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama and the big government economy, the median wage for women has dropped $733.
0.0	0.0	And under the laws of this country, he wasn't allowed to be with his father for seven years.
1.0	1.0	And they've stolen from you because now they know they cannot pay these benefits and Social Security is going to be insolvent in seven to eight years.
0.0	0.0480769230769	China, they don't like to tell us but they have total control -- just about, of North Korea.
0.0	1.0	Both served.
0.0	0.0	They do whatever what they do, OK.
1.0	1.0	When President Obama came into office we were losing 800,000 jobs a month, 800,000 jobs a month.
0.0	0.0285714285714	Well, we've gotta turn the economy around for people who are struggling.
0.0	0.0480769230769	A healthy environment, a strong economy and energy independent America -- that would be the purpose of my presidency, is break the strangle hold that people enjoy on fossil fuels who hate our guts.
0.0	1.0	To repeal these unconstitutional illegal orders, whether it's amnesty or whether it's this president going around the Congress, whether it's in Obamacare, to restore the rule of law.
0.0	1.0	You want to see a war on women?
0.0	0.0480769230769	We need a president that doesn't just talk a game, but a president that's got real results.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I do.
0.0	0.0	They don't buy their guns from a collector.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I would just say that...
0.0	0.0	...Then I'll buy you a tequila...
0.0	0.0480769230769	And for the life of me, I have no understanding why the president thinks that everything is going well.
0.0	1.0	It has to be based on what skills you have, what you can contribute economically, and most important of all, on whether or not you're coming here to become an American, not just live in America, but be an American.
0.0	0.0	Let me just -- let me respond.
0.0	1.0	We're going to end up in the same place.
0.0	0.0	If that's not hypocrisy, I don't know what hypocrisy is.
0.0	1.0	I mean, literally, the Senate -- what is it, like a French work week?
0.0	0.0480769230769	... president of the United States has got to do, and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility, is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe.
0.0	0.0	I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King.
0.0	1.0	And I'm very grateful to the brave Navy SEALs who carried out that mission.
0.0	0.0	I mean, Chris will know about that.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Well, first of all, thank you all for having us.
0.0	1.0	The answer is no.
0.0	1.0	...Chris...
0.0	1.0	I've seen plenty of other people follow up?
0.0	0.0285714285714	In Louisiana, instead we're helping people getting better paying jobs so they can provide for their own health care.
0.0	0.0285714285714	We're closing hospitals, we're closing wards, we're closing so many because the states want to save money.
0.0	0.0	Well, first of all, I'm 7 and 0 in my fantasy league.
0.0	0.0	And guess what?
0.0	0.0	Yes.
0.0	0.0	I voted for Dodd-Frank, got an important amendment in it.
0.0	1.0	Everytime they got a paycheck, the government reached in and took something out of it before they ever saw it.
0.0	0.0	You'll create a much better graduation rate at a lower cost, and you won't in debt the next generation with recourse debt on their backs.
0.0	1.0	This is a business flat tax.
0.0	0.0	Growth is the answer.
0.0	0.0	We have a president of the United States that is undermining this country's security and expanding the role of...
0.0	1.0	As we all remember, Senator Obama, when he ran against me, was against the war in Iraq.
0.0	0.0480769230769	You know, let me say something at the outset.
0.0	1.0	Take it from Lawrence Tribe.
1.0	0.987951807229	In 2008, Barack Obama missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes, and the same newspaper endorsed him again.
0.0	0.0	That's good.
0.0	0.0480769230769	You didn't see these kind of ideas being batted around, and being batted around in a way that's civil and smart and that's trying to help to inform the voter out there.
0.0	1.0	I'm tired of seeing what's going on, between the border where the people flow over; people come in; they live; they shoot.
0.0	0.0	That's why we embraced individual liberty, and we became the freest people ever, and the result was the American miracle.
0.0	1.0	Well, first of all, when we talk about the Import Export Bank, it's time to clean up corporate welfare.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And you don't go tell Muslim nations you want them to be part of a coalition when you have a leading candidate for president of the United States who insults their religion.
0.0	1.0	Thank you, senator.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Look, the truth is that a powerful nation like the United States, certainly working with our allies, we can overthrow dictators all over the world.
1.0	1.0	I didn't have an involvement with them.
0.0	0.0	I would like to start with a basic.
0.0	0.0480769230769	We lose, we have a trade imbalance...
0.0	1.0	And I spent my entire lifetime balancing federal budgets, growing jobs, the same in Ohio.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And he stood before the American people and he said, "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself," a profound statement that gave the American people the courage to believe that, yes, we could get out of that terrible depression.
0.0	0.0	Absolutely, we need to defund Planned Parenthood.
0.0	1.0	So, let's not in anyway imply here that either President Obama or myself, would in anyway not take on any vested interested, whether it's Wall Street, or drug companies, or insurance companies, or frankly, the gun lobby to stand up to do what's best for the American people.
0.0	0.0	The most mistreated people.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Let me tell you that, in this country -- in this country, people are concerned about their economic future.
0.0	0.0480769230769	This would be devastating for the economy.
0.0	1.0	We are lowering taxes on small business.
0.0	0.0	I want to talk to the folks at home.
0.0	1.0	First, we should pass the Expatriate Terrorist Act, legislation I've introduced that says if an American goes and joins ISIS and wages jihad against America, that you forfeit your citizenship and you can not come in on a passport.
0.0	0.987951807229	Nine months ago, our campaign began.
0.0	0.0	We called Ben, he was with me 100%.
0.0	0.0480769230769	What else we can do is that we should believe in science.
1.0	1.0	When I look at the migration, I looked at the line, I said it actually on your show recently, where are the women?
0.0	0.0480769230769	Do you remember that, everybody?
0.0	1.0	A growth of 385,000 jobs.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Well, obviously, you don't understand my views on homosexuality.
0.0	0.0	We would still have racism holding people back.
0.0	0.642857142857	You know, the annual Medicare budget is over $600 billion.
0.0	1.0	What's crony capitalism?
0.0	0.0	The questions that have been asked so far in this debate illustrate why the American people don't trust the media.
0.0	0.0	OK?
0.0	0.0	We can't afford another four years of that.
0.0	0.0	You know, a minute ago, Neil asked: What has President Obama do -- done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns?
0.0	1.0	You had two one hundred...
0.0	0.0480769230769	Thank you.
0.0	0.0480769230769	So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And we do need China -- Donald's right about North Korea.
0.0	0.0480769230769	But it doesn't change my view that we need to empower everyone, women and men, to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make.
0.0	0.0	Government causes a problem, and then government steps in to solve the problem.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I will do everything I can to make certain that the United States and our brave men and women in the military do not get bogged down in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.
0.0	0.0	Lawrence Tribe and (inaudible) from Harvard -- of Harvard, said that there is a serious question as to whether or not Ted can do this.
0.0	0.0480769230769	But nobody can deny that as a wartime leader, he rallied the British people when they stood virtually alone against the Nazi juggernaut and rallied them and eventually won an extraordinary victory.
0.0	0.0	Larry Kudlow is an example, who I have a lot of respect for, who loves my tax plan.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Here's the problem.
0.0	1.0	This president every chance he has ever gotten has tried to undermine the Second Amendment.
0.0	1.0	Simplifying the code and lowering rates, both for corporations and -- and personal rates, is exactly what we need to do.
1.0	1.0	In fact, the largest after- tax gains is for the people at the lower end of the tax spectrum under my plan.
0.0	0.0480769230769	No Jeb, I don't remember -- well, let me tell you.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Thank you.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And we can't be the stupid country any more.
0.0	0.0	And frankly, it just came out, and in Iowa now, as you know, Ted, in the last three polls, I'm beating you.
0.0	0.0	I want to use that same up here, whatever it may be to make America rich again and to make America great again.
1.0	1.0	And in Libya, for example, the United States, Secretary Clinton, as secretary of state, working with some other countries, did get rid of a terrible dictator named Gadhafi.
0.0	1.0	Government is the enemy.
0.0	0.0	Hey, I'm in the United States Senate, and anyone who doesn't think that there is an enormous amount of waste and inefficiency and bureaucracy throughout government would be very, very mistaken.
0.0	1.0	The people that Washington leaves behind.
0.0	0.0285714285714	You also have to prove that you're going to pay these people more than you would pay someone else, so that you're not undercutting it by bringing in cheap labor.
0.0	0.0	It's got great people, it's got loving people, wonderful people.
0.0	0.0	Mr. President, we're not against you.
0.0	0.0285714285714	I'm just saying.
0.0	1.0	China doesn't pay the tariff, the buyer pays the tariff.
0.0	1.0	Conservatives, I am a conservative because I believe no one of us is any better than any other one of us.
0.0	1.0	A law has been sitting -- languishing, sadly, on Capitol Hill and has not yet been passed, and it would help.
0.0	0.0285714285714	But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work.
0.0	0.0480769230769	It turns out we knew something was wrong.
0.0	1.0	Becky --
0.0	0.0	They don't like somebody else like David Petraeus, they prosecute them and send a decorated general on to disgrace.
0.0	1.0	If you get caught abusing this program, you should never be able to use it again.
0.0	0.987951807229	Our job has to be to recognize the conflict between the two.
0.0	0.987951807229	I wanna tell you, in my state, we took Medicaid, the hardest program to control, and we took it from a 10 percent growth rate to 2.5 percent without taking one person off the rolls or cutting one single benefit.
0.0	1.0	That's my bill.
0.0	0.0480769230769	You know, I think my biggest weakness is exactly the opposite.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Well, it's interesting.
0.0	0.0	If we're gonna reform welfare for poor people, we ought to reform it for rich people, as well.
0.0	0.0	You're right.
0.0	0.0480769230769	We have this enormous mismatch because we have smaller and smaller families.
0.0	0.0	I used the tithing analogy.
0.0	0.0285714285714	I am all in favor of keeping these talented people here so they can go to work in Silicon Valley.
0.0	0.6	Work requirements and time limits.
0.0	0.0	For too long -- no, for too long, what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our people's jobs, and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us.
0.0	0.0480769230769	They've been beaten into submission.
0.0	1.0	And I'll tell you why, last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee, she admitted she had sent emails to her family saying, hey, this attack in Benghazi was caused by al Qaeda-like elements.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I frankly don't think there will be much change because I think what's going to happen is you're going to get more of the same.
0.0	1.0	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.0	A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to go on a congressional delegation.
0.0	0.0480769230769	But the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with Iran, maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world, yes, that is something I want to achieve.
0.0	0.0	You can -- if you -- you flew in with your 767, didn't you?
0.0	0.0	No accomplishment.
0.0	0.0	We're going to get more revenue.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Where the secretary and I have a very profound difference, in the last debate -- and I believe in her book -- very good book, by the way -- in her book and in this last debate, she talked about getting the approval or the support or the mentoring of Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.0	There are other attorneys that feel, and very, very fine constitutional attorneys, that feel that because he was not born on the land, he cannot run for office.
0.0	0.0	And I just couldn't agree -- disagree more with those kinds of comments.
0.0	0.987951807229	You know, we could give you another example -- the Marines, the Army, these wonderful six soldiers that were killed.
0.0	1.0	It just needs a corporate executive type at the top that's done it before.
0.0	0.0	And, you know the old inscription, if you save one life, you've changed the world.
0.0	0.0	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	1.0	The majority of people in American actually have values and principles and they believe in the very things that made America great.
0.0	1.0	Imagine how hard it is for these people out there that are making 40, 50, $60,000 a year, and they're trying to provide for their families at a time when this economy is not growing.
0.0	0.987951807229	I'll tell you this, the number one job of the president of the United States is to protect the safety and security of the American people.
0.0	0.0285714285714	The point I'm making is this, the Federal Government should not be in a lot of things.
0.0	0.0	And I think the reason he did is because immigration is sort of an example of what's broken and what's wrong in Washington, D..C.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Okay.
0.0	0.0	I worked hard with not only federal agents but with police officers and here's the problem, sanctuary cities is part of the problem in this country.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I have proposed there be a Middle East NATO so that we can combine our allies there to stand up to Iranian expansion, and at the same time join together to begin to stop and this ISIL thing before it becomes an actual state.
0.0	0.0480769230769	The fact is, there's a number of things that the next president is going to have to do to clean up this mess.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I think -- I think it's fair to say we don't have a disagreement.
0.0	0.0	We have Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Big difference.
0.0	0.0	But guess who pushed for that regulation?
1.0	0.987951807229	Workforce participation rates lower than they were in 1977.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And it's not too much to ask of our generation after everything our parents and our grandparents did for us.
0.0	0.0	But we stuck to our message.
0.0	0.987951807229	We have more Americans out of work or just Americans who quit looking for work for 40 years.
0.0	0.0480769230769	They didn't do that.
0.0	0.0480769230769	We need a president who can solve our problems, bring us together.
0.0	1.0	The fact is, there is a big overhang.
0.0	0.0	I will not shock anybody to suggest that in politics there is occasionally a little bit of hypocrisy.
0.0	1.0	If we -- if we don't act now, we are going to be the first generation in American history that leaves our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.0285714285714	And if I am elected president, to every soldier and sailor and airman and marine, and to every police officer and firefighter and first responder who risk their lives to keep us safe, I will have your back.
1.0	1.0	He put a 25 million dollar check up from his own pocket to fund that campaign and my wife Heidi and I, we ended up investing everything we owned.
0.0	0.0	I don't think the founders put the Second Amendment as number two by accident.
0.0	0.0480769230769	It is an agenda, in my view, that would do great harm to our country.
0.0	1.0	He is not the only one.
0.0	0.0	Well, to start with, unlike President Obama, I'll actually name the enemy that we confront.
0.0	1.0	It's now half the size of what it was prior to Operation Desert Storm.
0.0	1.0	You're not interested in an answer.
0.0	0.0	And how do I know it?
0.0	0.0480769230769	I'm not -- my campaign is going to be about the future of America, it's not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage.
0.0	0.0	But the Democrats are going to bring a lawsuit, and you have to have certainty.
0.0	0.0	Well, I believe that there are abuses, those companies should be permanently barred from ever using the program again and we should put strict standards in place to ensure that they're not being abused, like the prevailing wage requirement and like the advertising requirement.
0.0	0.0285714285714	And they got a killer in San Bernardino in posing as a fiance.
0.0	0.0480769230769	... and I know Bernie, and I can promise you he's not going to be president of the United States.
0.0	0.0	It's one of the biggest problems our country has.
0.0	0.0480769230769	You know, coal miners and their families who helped turn on the lights and power our factories for generations are now wondering, has our country forgotten us?
0.0	0.0	You look at California, you look, frankly, at Paris where there's a -- the strictest no-gun policy of any city anywhere in the world, and you see what happens: 130 people dead with many to follow.
0.0	0.0	And this big powerful, corrupt bureaucracy works now only for the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I don't think it's so much about when the government orders a corporation to do something.
0.0	0.0480769230769	If we do that again, we will lose again, we will deserve to lose again.
0.0	0.0285714285714	We're friends.
0.0	0.0285714285714	I laid out a plan at the Citadel to do just that and it starts with creating a "No Fly Zone" and "Safe Zones" to make sure refugees are there.
0.0	0.0	And that's what we have to contrast.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I don't know if people understand, but I spent a lifetime with my colleagues getting us to a federal balanced budget.
0.0	0.987951807229	But when we talk about Wall Street, you have Wall Street and major banks have paid $200 billion in fines since the great crash.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Thank you.
0.0	0.0285714285714	And I'll note that California senator -- Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said, if she could say to Mr. America and Mrs. America, "give me your guns, I'm rounding them up," she would.
0.0	0.0480769230769	But if I become president, I couldn't care less about my company.
0.0	0.0480769230769	ISIS came in, and now occupies significant territory in Libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold.
0.0	0.0	For both of them you have to gradually raise the age.
0.0	1.0	Barack Obama got his massive tax increase, and there was no spending cuts.
0.0	0.0	I love China.
0.0	0.0	Why does the fossil fuel industry pay -- spend huge amounts of money on campaign contributions?
0.0	0.0	I want to speak to all of those maddened by political correctness, where Hillary Clinton apologizes for saying all lives matter.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I am proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend.
0.0	0.0	You know, I am by my nature impatient.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Progressives don't believe that.
0.0	1.0	So this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Well, this is what I would say.
0.0	0.0	And I'll tell you what a weakness is of this country: there are a lot of people who are sick and tired because Washington does not play by the same rules that the American people have to play by.
0.0	1.0	You bet they do.
0.0	1.0	Let the states do this.
0.0	1.0	I think, actually, people are looking for that in Washington now.
0.0	0.987951807229	Now 16 percent is what the rate Ted wants it at.
0.0	0.987951807229	A 100, 150 years ago incredibly brave Americans said, you know what, working class kids, low income kids should not have to work in factories or on the farms.
0.0	1.0	We can make a stronger program.
0.0	0.0	That never works.
0.0	0.0480769230769	He's wrong.
0.0	0.0480769230769	So I think the better approach, the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against China economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage Barack Obama is doing to this economy.
0.0	0.0480769230769	But here's the point I want to make tonight.
0.0	1.0	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.0	But here's the best way that we're going to make America much more exceptional: it is to make sure we put someone on that stage in September who will fight Hillary Clinton and make sure she never, ever gets in the White House again.
0.0	0.987951807229	His plan is a good plan, and I will note that my 10% plan also eliminates the payroll tax, eliminates the death tax,
0.0	0.0480769230769	What I said was I don't believe that I would be president of the United States and have the same dysfunction that exists in Washington, D.C. now.
0.0	0.0	I mean, let me be honest with the people who are watching at home.
0.0	1.0	Martha, religious liberty doesn't include encouraging a fellow American to engage in violent jihad and kill an American here.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Nobody can solve it like me.
0.0	1.0	And, we said no.
1.0	1.0	In Florida, we have the lowest in-state tuition of any state, because there's accountability, just as John said.
0.0	0.642857142857	$19 billion of tax cuts, 1.3 million jobs created.
0.0	1.0	And first of all, we've got to recognize that there is problem that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have caused.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I didn't inherit any money.
0.0	0.0	I'd like to jump in.
0.0	0.0	You can't get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year.
0.0	0.0	And by the way, as important as those two phone calls are, they are also very important because they say this.
0.0	1.0	Here's the bottom line.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I would just say this, we've heard a lot of great ideas up here, and I agree with what Senator Rubio said.
0.0	0.0	I've heard about tax schemes that don't add up, that put our kids in -- in a deeper hole than they are today.
0.0	1.0	This is absolutely disgusting, and revolts the conscience of the nation.
0.0	1.0	John, could I follow up on this?
0.0	0.0	The answer is simple.
0.0	0.0	Our vets are being treated horribly.
0.0	0.0	We have to put the personnel on that border in the right places; you have to put the strategic fencing in place; and you have to have aviation assets that fly all the way from Tijuana to El Paso to Brownsville, Texas -- 1,933 miles looking down 24/7, with the technology to be able to identify what individuals are doing, and ID when they are in obviously illegal activities or suspicious activities, and quick response teams come.
0.0	0.0	And, here's the difference between me and Hillary Clinton.
0.0	1.0	Total propaganda.
0.0	0.0	I know personally how extraordinary and unique this nation is.
0.0	1.0	I have no illusion.
0.0	0.0	You want to talk about moral authority.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And, when I hear people talking about means testing, let's just remember what that means.
0.0	0.0480769230769	That's not right.
0.0	0.987951807229	The main problem with Medicare right now is that the average person pays in taxes over their whole lifetime about $100,000.
0.0	1.0	And we would still have governors like Scott Walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions.
0.0	0.0480769230769	No, no.
0.0	1.0	You know, we -- we agree that we've got to get unaccountable money out of politics.
0.0	1.0	And that free education of extraordinary accomplishment was from first grade to 12th grade.
0.0	1.0	And, look, I think it's important to look at what the most important counterterrorism judgment of the first four years of the Obama administration was, and that was the very difficult decision as to whether or not to advise the president to go after bin Laden.
0.0	1.0	We are borrowing money from China today.
0.0	1.0	I mean, that's just the bottom line.
0.0	0.0	Well, first of all, like many other very big businessmen, I could name them here, but I'm not going to do that for a lot of obvious reasons, but the biggest, and almost all of them, they've all used the chapter laws, the bankruptcy laws to their own benefit.
0.0	0.0	And nobody watching at home believed that any of the moderators had any intention of voting in a Republican primary.
0.0	0.987951807229	We have to get the other 10 percent of the way to 100.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I would hope that you would come onboard and say that this is the simple and straightforward thing to do.
0.0	0.0480769230769	My Muslim friends, some, said, "thank you very much; we'll get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.0	And the people who are often the most hard-hit are widows, because when their spouse dies, they can lose up to one-half of their Social Security monthly payment.
0.0	0.0	I saw you on the Senate floor flip your vote on crop insurance because they told you it would help you in Iowa, and last week, we all saw you flip your vote on ethanol in Iowa for the same reason.
0.0	0.0	They shouldn't automatically assume that because you believe that marriage is between one man and one woman that you are a homophobe.
0.0	0.0	Yes.
0.0	0.0	Donald is right that China is running over President Obama like he is a child, President Obama is not protecting American workers and we are getting hammered.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.0	Divide that out.
0.0	0.0	I'm tested.
0.0	1.0	Just like getting rid of Medicare and Medicaid.
0.0	0.0	Here at home, we've got to do a better job coordinating between federal, state, and local law enforcement.
0.0	0.0	We have made it easier to do that, not harder.
0.0	1.0	It will be a way of life.
0.0	1.0	So look, in foreign policy -- in foreign policy, it's strength, but you've got to be cool.
0.0	0.0	And -- and -- you know, it goes back to the whole concept of regulations, which are in everything.
0.0	0.0480769230769	But the real -- but I think we have to get back to what this election has to be about.
0.0	1.0	Our next president, and our Republican nominee can not be someone who supports those positions.
0.0	0.0	So beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given -- bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money.
0.0	0.0	You know, Hillary Clinton's always saying how Republicans don't follow science?
0.0	0.0	-- at least half of the things Marco said are flat-out false.
0.0	0.0285714285714	I sell tens' of millions of (inaudible).
0.0	1.0	That they were going to have to hire 20,000 new IRS agencies to collect it.
0.0	0.0	Those are two leaders that I admire very much.
0.0	1.0	The final observation, invoked Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.0	That's exactly what we saw.
0.0	1.0	Did any of you get a phone call from Bill Clinton?
0.0	1.0	I have the largest bank in the world as a tenant of mine.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Every time we send signals like this, we send a signal of weakness, not strength.
0.0	0.0480769230769	That's a serious issue that we could work on.
0.0	1.0	You can trust me to do the following: that when I get on change with Hillary Clinton, we won't be debating about the science, we'll be debating about the solutions.
0.0	1.0	Now you are a worker, white worker, black worker, who had a decent job, that manufacturing job is gone.
0.0	0.0480769230769	So this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I don't care.
0.0	1.0	And, this is what I am finding throughout America.
0.0	1.0	I was the governor during the 9/11 attack when the Pentagon was struck.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I know for a fact how difficult it is to raise children, how expensive it's become for working families.
0.0	0.0	And if I were the prosecutor, that is exactly where they would be.
0.0	1.0	First thing I'd tell the American people, whatever it takes to defend our nation, I would do.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And I have a road map and a plan right now to get us to balance.
0.0	0.0	And I'll tell you, I'm not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump.
0.0	0.0	And that was the state of Texas.
0.0	1.0	I'm not running against Governor Bush, I'm not running against anyone on this stage.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Maybe we would've gotten a deal where we didn't give everything away.
0.0	0.0480769230769	It comes from the right, from the left, from people on all sides of the political spectrum.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Maria, I'd just like to say...
0.0	0.0	Now we're having smaller families.
0.0	0.0285714285714	Look, every time the Federal Government gets engaged in something it gets worse.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Well, first, Judy, I have spent my entire adult life working toward making sure that women are empowered to make their own choices, even if that choice is not to vote for me.
0.0	0.0480769230769	It goes in the right direction.
0.0	0.987951807229	It's a simple formula: common sense regulations, which is why I think we should freeze all federal regulations for one year, except for health and safety.
0.0	0.0480769230769	We have to support the fighters on the ground, principally the Arabs and the Kurds who are willing to stand up and take territory back from Raqqa to Ramadi.
0.0	0.0	That's fine.
0.0	0.0285714285714	We can use it to break up the banks, if that's appropriate.
0.0	1.0	Now, you've got Europe.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Again...
0.0	1.0	Now, thank God, my father was invited to a Bible study and became born again and he came back to my mom and me and we were raised together.
0.0	0.0480769230769	See, they don't like that.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Right.
0.0	0.0	And you can go get it at jeb2016.com.
0.0	0.0	Secondly, as it relates to Iran, we need to confront their ambitions across the board.
0.0	1.0	And I have the feeling you're going to find a lot of cost overruns there and a lot of waste and duplicative activities.
0.0	0.0285714285714	And I'm saying we have to get to the bottom of it.
0.0	0.0	I believe that we have got to pass comprehensive immigration reform, something that I strongly supported.
0.0	0.0480769230769	You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president...
0.0	0.0	And -- and I would note indeed, the reason I said that is I was asked -- my friend Donald has taken to it as (ph) advance playing Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the USA", and I was asked what I thought of that.
0.0	0.0	If there was a -- and you know I'm not bringing a suit.
0.0	0.987951807229	And now after seven years of your policies, we have the biggest majority we've had since the 1920s in the House; a Republican majority in the Senate; and 31 out of 50 Republican governors.
0.0	0.0	Where are you gonna clean it up?
0.0	0.0	And I believe that not only Barney Frank, Paul Krugman, and others, have said that what I have proposed is the most effective.
0.0	1.0	I'd also go after these sanctuary cities, do everything we can to make sure that we are not -- that we are actually prosecuting and cutting off funding for cities that are harboring illegal aliens, and then finally making sure the IRS is not going after conservative or religious groups.
0.0	0.0285714285714	But it is absolutely fair and necessary for Americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average American family?
0.0	0.0	For 30 years this country has been baited with that.
0.0	0.0	So, I think gun-free zones are a catastrophe.
0.0	1.0	Here's -- apart from the -- apart from the higher prices on consumers and people are living paycheck to paycheck, apart from that, there will be retaliation.
0.0	1.0	But what happened is a political vacuum developed.
0.0	0.0285714285714	Hey look, he never had a chance.
0.0	0.0480769230769	That has not been...
0.0	0.0480769230769	We have got to destroy their training camps and recruiting centers.
0.0	0.0480769230769	We do.
0.0	0.0480769230769	So we have to go after this both abroad and at home.
0.0	0.0	I said right from the beginning that we should take no Syrian refugees of any kind.
0.0	0.0285714285714	First, rather than expand benefits for everyone, I do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs.
0.0	0.0	I will not do that.
0.0	1.0	Are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the Assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire?
0.0	1.0	This campaign is not just about electing a president.
0.0	0.0	When I'm president, we're going to have a president that acts like it.
0.0	0.0	Look, the Second Amendment is not an option.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I don't -- look, I don't think anybody should be expanding Medicaid.
0.0	0.0480769230769	No -- no...
0.0	0.0480769230769	Because I've done it.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And as far as the Syrians are concerned, Al-Hasakah province, perfect place.
0.0	0.0	Now, Bill, he loves to criticize America, apologize for us, criticize medieval Christians.
0.0	1.0	And that's why I've come forward with, for example, a plan to revitalize coal country, the coalfield communities that have been so hard hit by the changing economy, by the reduction in the use of coal.
0.0	1.0	Now, I'm the only person that's put out a detailed plan on how to deal with entitlements.
0.0	0.0	Trying to get Iran and Saudi Arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter.
0.0	1.0	Now hundreds of companies I've opened.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Well, I think, Judy, what has to be appreciated is that, as a result of the disastrous and illegal behavior on Wall Street, millions of lives were hurt.
0.0	0.0285714285714	Well, sure.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Well, first of all, recognize it is a substantial problem.
0.0	0.987951807229	But I also think that these are very serious times; 75 percent of the American people think the federal government is corrupt.
0.0	0.0480769230769	We have to find out -- many people knew about what was going on.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And when countries violate trade agreements or dump product in this country, we need -- we need to stand up against those countries that do that without making them into an enemy.
0.0	1.0	He got lucky with fracking.
0.0	0.0	... that suspends all refugees from nations that ISIS or Al Qaida controls significant territory.
0.0	0.0	As an outsider, I tackled H.P.
0.0	1.0	They're tough, they're strong, they're great people.
0.0	1.0	Are you concerned like I am that the debt and deficits of Washington, D.C. are endangering America's future?
0.0	0.987951807229	After those four years of looking back and being prepared, the preparation to be the most powerful individual in the world requires an extraordinary amount of work: not just having been the governor of the 12th largest economy in the world, which I might add, we added 1.5 million jobs during that period of time over that 2007 through 2014 period, a period when America was going through the most deep recession it had been through since the Great Depression.
0.0	0.0	Reforms, everything from moral and cultural issues to economic issues.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.0	I was governor on September 11th, and I'm proud of my leadership in bringing New York through that time.
1.0	1.0	Look, I have an A plus rating in the NRA and we also have a reduction in gun violence because in Florida, if you commit a crime with a gun, you're going away.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Everybody's record's going to be scrutinized, and at the end of the day we need to unite behind the winner so we can defeat Hillary Clinton, because she is a disaster.
0.0	1.0	That's the end of the conversation.
0.0	1.0	We went after companies that were doing things that were against the law.
0.0	1.0	And I appreciate greatly Senator Sanders' voting record.
0.0	1.0	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.0	Super PACs are a disaster.
0.0	0.0	We have to do something.
0.0	1.0	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.0	We need a doer, not a talker.
0.0	0.0480769230769	When I think about the folks who are out there at home tonight watching, and I think about what they had to watch this week -- the spectacle they had to watch on the floor of the House of Representatives, with the president of the United States, who talked a fantasy land about the way they're feeling.
0.0	1.0	And not only did I fight them, but I beat them.
0.0	0.0480769230769	It's a hard problem.
1.0	1.0	You know, the FBI director, the president's appointed FBI director has said this week that because of a lack of support from politicians like the president of the United States, that police officers are afraid to get out of their cars; that they're afraid to enforce the law.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Akin to slavery, where people came into this country to do guest work were abused, were exploited, and if they stood up for their rights, they'd be thrown out of this country.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Right now, you don't have the -- you have taxes that are too high.
0.0	0.0	And this is one of the myths that the left perpetrates on our society, and this is how they frighten people and get people to shut up.
0.0	0.987951807229	Yeah, but that -- because the math is, if you -- 5 percent of a million is a lot more than 5 percent of a thousand.
1.0	0.0	We don't need the federal government to be involved in this at all.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I mean, just think about a scenario like that.
0.0	0.0480769230769	We're not going to be able to rebuild it unless we put a no-fly zone there, make it safe for those folks so we don't have to be talking about Syrian refugees anymore.
0.0	0.0	Let me just say on taxes, how long have we been talking about tax reform in Washington, D.C.?
0.0	0.0	I want to find out why those two young people -- those two horrible young people in California when they shot the 14 people, killed them -- people they knew, people that held the wedding reception for them.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I love the Chinese people but they laugh themselves, they can't believe how stupid the American leadership is.
0.0	0.0	We have a country of borders.
0.0	1.0	I am a conservative; I can win this job, I can do this job, I need your help, I need your support.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word.
0.0	0.0480769230769	...
0.0	0.0480769230769	And if you go to my Web site, berniesanders.com, what you find is not only going to help lead the opposition to that war, but much of what I feared would happen when I spoke on the floor of the House, in fact, did happen in terms of the instability that occurred.
0.0	0.0285714285714	We have to stop the money flow.
0.0	0.0	What I said, and let me repeat it, I don't know what economists Secretary Clinton is talking to, but what I have said, and let me repeat it, that yes, the middle -- the family right in the middle of the economy would pay $500 dollars more in taxes, and get a reduction in their healthcare costs of $5,000 dollars.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Well, let me just -- let me just say, once again...
0.0	0.0	It's peanuts.
0.0	1.0	He's got probably a four or five percent chance.
0.0	1.0	We're going to have a three-bracket tax code, 10, 15 and 25 percent.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Let's talk about something that happened this week in the news.
0.0	0.0	I would do that to Barack Obama's executive orders.
0.0	0.0285714285714	Does he stand up for law enforcement?
0.0	0.0480769230769	You've got to have a clear vision of where you want to go.
0.0	0.0480769230769	They expect to have it.
0.0	0.0480769230769	We will renew America if we work together, and I am totally confident that we will.
0.0	0.0	See?
0.0	0.0480769230769	And let me be clear.
0.0	1.0	Folks, the government has no business stealing even more from the people who have paid this in.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I don't know where you...
0.0	0.0480769230769	Well, gee, after the last debate, I was told that I didn't smile enough.
0.0	0.0	The guns don't pull the trigger.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Thank you.
0.0	0.0	And, folks, we will.
0.0	0.0480769230769	She'd be a great president of the United States because the leadership she brought to H.P.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Secondly, I certainly support that we need to tear down cyber walls, not on a mass basis, but on a targeted basis.
1.0	0.987951807229	And I know this, because when I ran for governor of New York, one in 11 of every man, woman, and child in the state of New York was on welfare.
1.0	0.987951807229	But I will -- but I will tell you this, the socialist says they're going to pay for everything and give you everything for free, except they don't say they're going to raise it through taxes to 90 percent to do it.
0.0	0.0	Every election we talk about Medicare and Social Security reform.
0.0	0.0285714285714	We're going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education.
0.0	0.0480769230769	The fact of the matter is we're not going to have peace -- we are not going to have peace in Syria.
0.0	0.0480769230769	That's real moral authority that we need in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I mean the fact is, is that they need to put the pressure on and frankly we need to intercepts ships coming out of North Korea so they don't proliferate all these dangerous materials.
0.0	1.0	I think Americans want someone to have a track record of showing them how to get this country back on record, someone who will stand up and every day project that best days of America are in front of us.
0.0	1.0	So what we're going to have to start doing instead of, you know, picking on this group or this group, is we're going to have to have a major reduction in the regulatory influence that is going on.
0.0	0.987951807229	One as a marine officer in Iraq, one as an army officer in Afghanistan.
0.0	0.0	What you need to do is free up interest rates.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I mean, you know...
0.0	1.0	You blindfold the American people so that they cannot see the true cost of government.
0.0	0.0480769230769	But let's not kid ourselves.
0.0	1.0	Carl Icon today as you know endorsed.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I have a feeling it's going to work out, actually.
0.0	0.0480769230769	In fact, he's done worse than nothing.
0.0	0.0	I think what our campaign is indicating is that the American people are tired of establishment politics, tired of establishment economics.
1.0	1.0	And on Common Core, Common Core has been eliminated in New Jersey.
0.0	0.0	... you had two 110-story buildings come crashing down.
0.0	0.987951807229	Or we're going to ship 10 million Americans -- or 10 million people out of this country, leaving their children here in this country and dividing families?
0.0	1.0	They're Muslim.
0.0	0.0480769230769	So we need new leadership -- yes.
0.0	0.0480769230769	We have no borders.
0.0	0.0	This president and John Kerry and Hillary Clinton all have made it harder for the next president to act, but he must act to confront the ambitions of Iran.
0.0	0.0	...eliminates the business...
0.0	0.0	They said they would get rid of the unconstitutional amnesty.
0.0	1.0	We need the lawyers(ph) off the back of the war fighters.
0.0	0.0	Twenty-four months ago, 36 months ago, you did not have a group of radical crazies named ISIS who were burning people in cages and recruiting people to enter our country legally.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And they say down as a group trying to make sure that we can begin to heal some of these problems that we see between community and police.
0.0	0.0480769230769	You know, as I said already twice in this debate, we have a very serious problem in this country.
0.0	1.0	And I've done it in the state of Ohio as the chief executive.
0.0	0.0	No, the new planes.
0.0	1.0	...we need to honor our promises...
0.0	1.0	And now in Ohio, with the same formula, wages higher than the -- than the national average.
0.0	1.0	And yes, the economy is rigged in favor of those at the top.
0.0	0.987951807229	And not only did I win, but I then worked with a Democratic legislature to put in place the most sweeping conservative reforms of any state in America, taking us from the most dangerous state in America to the fourth safest; reducing our welfare rolls by over 1 million, and replacing over 700,000 private sector jobs.
0.0	1.0	I would just say, I debated then Senator Obama numerous times on stages like this, and he was the recipient of the largest number of Wall Street donations of anybody running on the Democratic side ever.
0.0	0.0	I have Ivanka, and Eric and Don sitting there.
0.0	0.0	Yes.
0.0	0.0	After the war we had all of these kids, Baby Boomers.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I believe in it but we have to be smart and we have to use smart people to negotiate.
0.0	0.0285714285714	It will cause the economy to grow, to explode, to create more jobs.
0.0	0.0285714285714	We're laughed at all over the world.
0.0	0.0480769230769	These mythical Arab armies that my friends talk about that are going to protect us don't exist.
0.0	0.0480769230769	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.0285714285714	I cut the bureaucracy down to size, re-introduced accountability, focused on service, on innovation, on leading in every market, in every product segment.
1.0	1.0	They were watching the humiliation of our young ten sailors, sitting on the floor with their knees in a begging position, their hands up.
0.0	0.0	Well, I wish you would have asked that question years ago when they broke it.
1.0	1.0	They see more people in jail in the United States of America than any other country on earth, 2.2 million.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And we need to make that very clear to everybody.
0.0	0.0480769230769	We have a world that's out of control and has grown dangerous and a president that is weakening our military and making our foreign policy unstable and unreliable in the eyes of our allies.
0.0	1.0	I'm in favor of people coming into this country legally.
0.0	0.0285714285714	Some do, but many Americans are dying to have an opportunity to grow and to create something inside this economy.
0.0	0.0	I've been passionate my whole life about the Constitution.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I would also just say this.
0.0	0.0	Neil, the problem...
0.0	1.0	But, here is the truth.
0.0	0.0480769230769	We have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone.
0.0	0.0	But let me just say that we also need down -- to tear down the cyber walls that China is erecting, that Russia is erecting.
0.0	0.0480769230769	But we are where we are right now.
0.0	0.0480769230769	How about this?
0.0	1.0	And remember, the Russians have not gone after ISIS or any of the other terrorist groups.
0.0	0.0480769230769	We need to know who our neighbors are.
0.0	0.0	-- the governor's absolutely right.
0.0	0.0285714285714	So we've got some real work to do, and let's try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the Russians.
0.0	0.0	They go to Princeton.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And he said, oh, I'm never going to attack.
0.0	0.0480769230769	We could do a whole show on that.
0.0	0.0480769230769	We have a lot of work to do with Iran before we ever say that they could move toward normalized relations with us.
0.0	0.0	So we need 1,000.
0.0	1.0	And, I'll do that with the country.
0.0	0.987951807229	I believe that when real unemployment is close to 10%, and when our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, Flint, Michigan comes to mind.
0.0	1.0	If she gets elected, she's under investigation with the FBI right now.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Someone who's going to stand up, and be very clear with our enemies as to the lines their going to draw and stand with them.
0.0	0.0	Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the co-chair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat.
0.0	0.0	I love this country.
0.0	0.0	Check it out.
0.0	0.0	Well, there is no question that some people go overboard when it comes to trying to make profits, and they don't take into consideration the American people.
0.0	1.0	They do celebrate more dependence on the government.
0.0	0.0480769230769	But, what we did is we said to the working families of this country, look, we know things are tough, but if you want to help us go beyond establishment politics, and establishment economics, send us something.
0.0	1.0	But, now for millions of Americans, it's slipping away.
0.0	0.0285714285714	He wants to change America.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Well, it's an interesting question because I'm very proud of my company.
0.0	0.0	He's been a good governor, and he's a heck of a lot better than his predecessor that would have bankrupted New Jersey.
0.0	0.0	I'm not anti-Wall Street, but I don't believe the government ought to wear a team jersey, pick winners and losers.
0.0	1.0	And I'll allow putting that tariff or whatever he's saying here...
0.0	0.0285714285714	We have to do this in unison with the Arab world.
0.0	0.0480769230769	They do it to us, we don't it.
0.0	1.0	There are ways to retrain the 50 and 51-year-olds, because they've got great value.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And the last line standing between them and our families might be us and a gun.
0.0	0.0	Americans are tired of hearing this debate -- want to go to, what are you going to do about illegal immigration?
0.0	1.0	...income tax...
0.0	0.0	... that after the 9/11 attacks, Secretary Rumsfeld invited me to the Pentagon with a meeting of the former secretaries of Defense.
0.0	0.0480769230769	No.
0.0	0.0480769230769	If we're going to have a coalition, we're going to have to have a coalition not just of people in the western part of the world, our European allies, but we need the Saudis, we need the Egyptians, we need the Jordanians, we need the Gulf states.
0.0	0.0	But mostly, the highest calling of leadership is to challenge the status-quo and unlock the potential of others.
0.0	0.0480769230769	(LAUGHTER) And he got nasty.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Can I tell you what?
0.0	0.0480769230769	Think about it.
0.0	0.0480769230769	It's fine if they come in, but they have to come in legally.
0.0	0.0	It was LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations in this country.
0.0	0.0	...you wrote a story on it, and you had to go back and correct it.
1.0	0.0	They stole it.
0.0	1.0	And we know of the tragic, terrible event that lead to the death of Dontre Hamilton right here in Milwaukee, a young man unarmed, who should still be with us.
0.0	0.0	So you don't get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.0285714285714	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.0	He's a good guy, a smart guy, and he would be a heck of a lot better president than Hillary Rodham Clinton would ever be.
0.0	1.0	Who actually has stood up not just to Democrats, but to leaders in our own party?
0.0	0.0	Ohio, one of the best growing places in the country -- I not only did it in Washington, I did it in Ohio, and I'll go back to Washington, and there will be no more silly deals...
0.0	1.0	And this is not an endeavor that rewards that.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Well, that's a real question.
0.0	1.0	It can not be someone that agrees with his agenda.
0.0	1.0	Yes, I believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on Wall Street, that they are a Wall Street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession -- Great Depression.
0.0	0.0285714285714	Listen, in any Republican primary, everyone is going to say they support the Second Amendment.
0.0	1.0	Reforming entitlements, cutting taxes.
0.0	1.0	That's who's in my mind
0.0	0.987951807229	It is imposed on business and a critical piece that Marco seems to be missing is that this 16 percent business flat tax enables us to eliminate the corporate income tax.
0.0	0.0	We're bringing corporate taxes down, bringing money back in, corporate inversions.
0.0	0.0	So there are people watching tonight in business.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I just don't believe that this country's days are going to be deeply -- you know, going down.
0.0	0.987951807229	We were one of two states to go to AAA bond rating, and our government spending was far less than the spending in people's income.
0.0	0.0285714285714	And so when we talk to our allies and we give them our word, in a Christie administration, they know we're going to keep it.
0.0	0.0480769230769	You just don't make promises like this.
0.0	1.0	It is broke, it is not working.
0.0	1.0	Illegal.
0.0	0.0	Can you have Medicare or Social Security?
0.0	0.0480769230769	Here's my second problem.
0.0	1.0	... and here's the critical point, Maria -- the business flat tax enables us to abolish the corporate income tax, the death tax, the Obamacare taxes, the payroll taxes, and they're border-adjustable, so every export pays no taxes whatsoever.
0.0	1.0	My four children have been able to receive a good Christian education, and I've been able to save for them to go to college so they never have to have the loans that I did.
0.0	0.0	How do I know this?
0.0	1.0	I voted against the war in Iraq because I listened very carefully to what President Bush and Vice President Cheney had to say and I didn't believe them.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I'm president -- look, I've done it once.
0.0	0.0	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.0480769230769	But many, many people did.
0.0	0.987951807229	I believe that we need to cut these taxes down, we need to be on a roadmap to balancing the budget, and we need to send power, money, and influence, the welfare department, the education department, job training, infrastructure, Medicaid, all of that out of Washington back to the states so we can run these programs from where we live to the top, not a one size fits all mentality that they have in Washington.
0.0	0.0480769230769	But I think I'll go back to building buildings if it doesn't work out.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Maria -- Maria, what you were talking about just now is called corporate inversion.
1.0	1.0	If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world -- and we double tax, as you know.
0.0	0.0480769230769	They can't even make a deal.
0.0	1.0	Where did that spirit come from in America?
0.0	0.0480769230769	And -- and I guess I can -- can frame it another way.
0.0	0.987951807229	We are nineteen trillion dollars -- our country's a mess and we can't let all these people come into our country and break our borders.
0.0	1.0	I never said that.
0.0	0.0	And Carl -- Carl, I'm not finished yet.
0.0	0.0	His first election and his re-election.
0.0	1.0	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.0	I was ready to lead, but I wasn't ready to run.
0.0	1.0	My father was born in Italy, and shortly after he was born my grandfather immigrated to this country.
0.0	0.0	It would not necessitate us raising any taxes.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Friends of mine are ordering Kamatsu (ph) tractors now because they've de-valued the yen to such an extent that you can't buy a Caterpillar tractor.
1.0	1.0	You used to say that you were in favor of birthright citizenship, now you say that you are against it.
0.0	0.987951807229	I am very proud, if my memory is not correct -- I think I am -- that I have a lifetime -- and I've been in Congress a few years -- a lifetime 100 percent pro-choice voting record.
0.0	0.0	Two quick responses.
0.0	0.0480769230769	It's not only a problem here.
0.0	0.0	A lot has happened in nine months.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And kind of -- that's what I see our campaign is about right now.
0.0	0.0	The time to turn the page is now.
0.0	0.0285714285714	This is the only time I've had a chance, let me finish.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Thank you.
0.0	1.0	(inaudible), the great majority of Republicans and Americans believe in a hopeful future.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.987951807229	I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years, and by the way, one of the members of that committee was Senator Strom Thurmond from South Carolina.
0.0	0.0	Let people play, who cares?
0.0	1.0	The reality is four times as many blacks get arrested for marijuana.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Well, Senator, look, I think we're in vigorous agreement here.
0.0	0.0	This is why, fundamentally, we have to take our government back.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I'm the only person on this stage who's done that and we will get it done as President of the United States.
1.0	0.987951807229	Later that year, in 2004, John Kerry ran for president missing close to 60 to 70 percent of his votes.
0.0	1.0	The biggest tax increase happened under the watch of Barack Obama, and spending's gone up.
0.0	1.0	We're against your policies.
0.0	0.0	And as president of the United States, it's all about communication, folks.
1.0	1.0	You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don't agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements.
0.0	0.0	And I'll tell you what, Donald, you -- you very kindly just a moment ago offered me the V.P.
0.0	0.0	Wait a minute, who in their 16th month?
0.0	0.0	That's why I've entered this race, and I think I have the experience to do it.
0.0	1.0	No one is a socialist.
0.0	0.0	I stood yesterday with 75 construction workers.
0.0	0.0	We have to get back into looking at what's causing it.
0.0	1.0	You gotta be patient.
0.0	0.0480769230769	We need to make sure that we do everything across all kinds of energy: natural gas, oil, absolutely.
0.0	1.0	They shouldn't be going to Europe.
0.0	0.0480769230769	(LAUGHTER) I'll tell you what.
0.0	0.0	You want to fix Medicare?
0.0	0.0480769230769	It's not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.0	If I could just respond.
0.0	0.0	It goes away.
0.0	0.0	We'll go to the Congress.
0.0	0.0285714285714	I'm going to go to the commanders and say give me a plan to win.
0.0	0.0	Let me tell you, Donald Trump would be a president every day of the week and twice on Sunday, rather than Hillary.
0.0	1.0	You are working at McDonald's?
0.0	0.0480769230769	If you looking at what happened with Boeing and if you look at what happened with so many companies that deal -- so we don't have an equal playing field.
0.0	1.0	We have to obey the laws.
0.0	1.0	We came back from the dead.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And that's really a theme of a lot of the things that I'm talking about.
0.0	0.0	Why didn't they turn those two people in so that you wouldn't have had all the death?
0.0	0.0480769230769	They look around for gun-free zones.
0.0	0.0285714285714	And we got to fight like crazy so people can think the American dream still exists, because it does, with rising wages, with full employment and with everybody in America -- and I mean everybody in America -- having an opportunity to realize the American dream of having a better life than their mother and their father.
0.0	1.0	My name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And it is difficult to in any way argue with the goal that we both share.
0.0	1.0	You see, all of my career, I've fought about giving voice to the people that I grew up with and voice to the people that elected me.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I would like to take a hard look at every part of the federal government and really do the kind of analysis that would rebuild some confidence in people that we're taking a hard look about what we have, you know, and what we don't need anymore.
0.0	1.0	You get the Congress.
0.0	0.0	And, then we have to go after sentencing, and that's one of the problems here in Wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn't happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level.
0.0	1.0	I propose to reverse that and get this economy moving again.
0.0	0.0	We have Arab allies.
0.0	0.0480769230769	But all of my career, you know, having been raised in -- by a mailman father whose father was a coal miner, who died of black lung and was losing his eyesight; or a mother whose mother could barely speak English.
0.0	0.0480769230769	So, you know, we'll take our progress wherever we can find it.
0.0	0.0	They like General Motors, so they give them a pass.
0.0	0.0	If I'm president, there won't be stupid deals anymore.
1.0	1.0	I'm very proud that I support legislation that is currently in the Congress, got support of almost all progressive Democrats in the House and Senate, which says we will end the absurdity of women today making 79 cents on the dollar compared to men.
0.0	1.0	He launched Fast and Furious, illegally selling guns to Mexican drug lords that were then used to shoot law enforcement officials.
0.0	0.0	It's the evil government that is -- that is putting all these regulations on us so that we can't survive.
0.0	0.0480769230769	We used to win, we don't win anymore.
0.0	1.0	The second point, it does not eliminate the corporate tax or the payroll tax.
0.0	1.0	We can get back in the game to restore order and security for our own country.
0.0	0.0	I will run on my record all day long.
0.0	0.0285714285714	And you look around, and you see what's happening, and this is not the case when he introduced the doctor -- very nice, everything perfect but that is not representative of what you have in that line of migration.
0.0	0.987951807229	Let us actually go to zero- based budgeting so we know where the money is being spent.
0.0	1.0	Folks, we have a problem here with the leadership in Washington, but I'll tell you another problem.
0.0	0.0480769230769	No, I didn't care (inaudible).
0.0	1.0	We need Jordan.
0.0	1.0	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, the slower the economy becomes.
0.0	0.0285714285714	I've laid out...
0.0	0.0	They are worried to death about the future of their kids.
0.0	0.0480769230769	But the final thing I want to say about this is the following.
0.0	0.0480769230769	We need to arm the Kurds the directly.
0.0	0.0480769230769	The only way we're going to solve this problem is with we, the people.
0.0	0.0	I mean, she would drive a car until it wouldn't make a sound, and then gather up all her coins and buy a new car.
0.0	0.0	I don't recall them calling for his resignation --
0.0	0.0480769230769	You know, I want to go back for a moment to what we were just talking about.
1.0	0.642857142857	We borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.0480769230769	They built the great wall of China.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I have fought my entire life to make sure that healthcare is a right for all people.
0.0	0.0	First of all, yes, we've stolen.
0.0	1.0	We're going to do a tax cut for all Americans.
0.0	0.0	You do the arithmetic.
0.0	1.0	Our country is being run by incompetent people.
0.0	0.0	The fact is, in order to get this economy moving again, I call for freezing regulations for a year except for the problem of public safety.
0.0	0.0	Karen and I have seven children.
0.0	0.0	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government in setting up -- retirement plans.
0.0	1.0	So as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and the like.
0.0	0.0	That's gonna be the real growth engine.
1.0	0.0	We can't afford to have another four years like the last eight years.
0.0	0.0	According to the generals that I know and trust, this air campaign will not destroy ISIL.
0.0	0.0480769230769	We're going to have too many people in the cart rather than pulling the cart.
0.0	0.0480769230769	We know this for a fact.
0.0	0.0	Came out great.
0.0	0.0285714285714	That's the way it should be, and I'm going to continue to reach out to thank all my online contributors for everything they are doing for me, to encourage them and help me do more just as Senator Sanders is.
0.0	0.0	And you know what?
0.0	0.0480769230769	We actually did it.
0.0	0.0	Well, it ain't Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.0	That is total propaganda, and this is what happens in our society.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I don't think it's a war on women for all of us as Americans to stand up and stop harvesting organs from little babies.
0.0	0.0	This is a guy who just believes that law enforcement are the bad guys.
0.0	1.0	Well, he appointed Eric Holder as attorney general.
0.0	0.0480769230769	What this campaign is about is creating a process for a political revolution in which millions of Americans, working people who have given up on the political process, they don't think anybody hears their pains or their concerns.
0.0	1.0	No radical Islam that is allowed to engage in encouraging violence against Americans, that is not protected speech.
0.0	1.0	And, that will get to the nub of opportunity for our children, and an ability to see wages rise.
0.0	0.0	We have to show that we can march to a balanced budget.
0.0	0.0	-- living in extreme poverty is the highest level on record.
0.0	1.0	I agree with my colleagues.
0.0	0.0480769230769	You don't have to.
0.0	0.0285714285714	We're going to bring jobs and manufacturing back.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Well, with respect to Syria, I really do appreciate the efforts that Secretary Kerry has made.
0.0	0.0285714285714	The truth is that sentencing for blacks is higher than for whites.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Maria, you look at what this president and his secretary of state, Secretary of State Clinton, has done to get us in this spot.
0.0	0.0285714285714	You think about it -- this is the president who said, along with his secretary of state -- drew a red line in Syria, said, if Assad uses chemical weapons against his people, that we're going to attack.
0.0	0.0480769230769	It was never intended that the government should be in every aspect of our lives.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Well, I don't know.
0.0	0.0	I'm very proud.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And, sometimes we're held up in contempt by people who write columns, but, I guarantee you to every person on this stage there's something deep inside of us that would cause us to give up our livelihoods and step out on this stage and fight for the people of America.
0.0	1.0	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.0480769230769	She said the truth.
0.0	0.0	And then we need to shut down -- we need to shut down their mechanisms of funding and attack their command-and-control centers.
0.0	1.0	Sometimes you win a war by killing murderous, evil terrorists.
0.0	1.0	And here's what the economic issue is.
0.0	0.0480769230769	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.0	I don't know if any of us could have done what they did, one after another, within 48 hours of that tragedy taking place.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I think he means somebody who hasn't been a career politician, and who's been out of office for awhile.
0.0	1.0	It's why you see the banks consolidating.
0.0	0.0285714285714	We both want to get more revenue in.
0.0	1.0	We're one of the fastest growing states in the country.
0.0	0.0	Socialist and government dependent.
0.0	0.0285714285714	Those of you health savings accounts.
0.0	0.0	And, people are sick of believing that the government is never going to really address this.

0.0	0.0	It takes away discretion from judges.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Yeah, he said everybody.

0.0	0.0	We called in, we said, that's it.
0.0	0.0480769230769	How do we utilize our intellect rather than allowing the government to use its, quote, "intellect," in order to help us to be able to live healthier and better lives?
0.0	0.987951807229	But I do hope that in years to come, just as occurred with Cuba, 10, 20 years ago, people would say, reach normalized relations with Cuba.
0.0	0.0	There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies.
0.0	0.0480769230769	(APPLAUSE) This is not a cage match.
0.0	0.0	One principle, for example, we've got to embrace is on immigration.
0.0	1.0	What I did in New York was bring people together, an overwhelmingly Democratic state.
0.0	0.0	I mean, you have great constitutional lawyers that say you can't run.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And when it comes to the issues that are really on the front lines as to whether we're going to have equal pay, paid family leave, some opportunity for, you know, women to go as far as their hard work and talent take them, I think that we still have some barriers to knock down, which is why that's at the core of my campaign.
0.0	1.0	There are lids on people's aspirations.
0.0	0.0480769230769	But they can't get along.
0.0	0.0	We now have a 73,000-page tax code.
0.0	0.0480769230769	So I have nothing at all critical of him.
0.0	0.0480769230769	That's what he is.
0.0	0.0285714285714	And I think when you give low-income kids -- African-American, white, Latino kids -- the opportunities to get their lives together, they are not going to end up in jail.
0.0	0.0	is exactly the leadership we need in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.0	Regulations in this country are out of control, especially the Employment Prevention Agency, the EPA, and all of the rules they continue to impose on our economy and hurting us.
0.0	0.0	But the idea that you can't -- that you're just gonna grow your way out of this -- I have a plan to grow the economy at 4 percent, but you're gonna have to make adjustments for both Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Let me conclude by just saying this.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Japan, the same thing.
0.0	0.0	Whether it's welfare reform and getting something back for the hard-earned taxpayers; whether it's engaging in Pentagon reform and taking on the big contractors that were charging thousands of dollars for hammers and screw drivers and ripping us off; or whether it's taking on the special interests in the nursing home industry in Ohio, so that mom and dad can have the ability to stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.
0.0	0.0	I'm the only one on this stage who has a plan that's actually reduced -- actually going to reduce immigration.
0.0	0.0	The first speech I gave in this campaign back in April was about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration.
0.0	0.0	So, we are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we have to root out in our society.
0.0	0.0480769230769	We took a loan against our assets to invest it in that campaign to defend ourselves against those attacks.
0.0	0.0	This is an interesting point when you talk about immigration.
0.0	0.0480769230769	It's "give me options on how I can make it harder for law-abiding people to buy guns."
0.0	1.0	If we elect Hillary Clinton, the next four years will be worse than the last eight, and our children will be the first Americans ever to inherit a diminished country.
0.0	0.987951807229	Yes, I thought about running four years ago.
0.0	0.0	Give Bernie Sanders credit.
0.0	1.0	It should be what are your substantive positions...
0.0	0.0	Your prosecute criminals.
0.0	1.0	But then his poll numbers tanked.
0.0	0.0	I want to ask you: Are you fed up with how Washington taxes you?
0.0	1.0	If you saw that blimp that got cut loose from Maryland today, it's a perfect example of government.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Look, we are fighting for every vote that we can get from women, from men, straight, gay, African-Americans, Latinos, Asian-Americans.
0.0	0.0	That debate reflected a debate between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I didn't find it offensive at all.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Thank you for that question.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don't add up, and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now.
0.0	0.0	If you're a Washington lobbyist, if you make your money in and around Washington, things are doing great.
0.0	0.0480769230769	No.
0.0	1.0	Well, I am going to answer your question, Neil.
0.0	1.0	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.0480769230769	It puts us on a level, even playing field, which brings jobs here at home...
0.0	1.0	Come with me to Iraq and Afghanistan, folks.
0.0	0.0	No, I oppose it because you're taking money from the entitlement and then spending it immediately on other items.
0.0	1.0	You find me a Democrat -- you find me a Democrat that will cut spending ten dollars?
0.0	0.0	You know, that's so simple.
0.0	0.0480769230769	In my case, whether it's health care, or getting us to debt-free tuition, or moving us toward paid family leave, I have been very specific about where I would raise the money, how much it would cost, and how I would move this agenda forward.
0.0	0.0480769230769	This isn't the governments money.
0.0	0.0480769230769	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.0285714285714	Look, here is the reality, folks.
0.0	0.0	Our next president...
0.0	0.0	I applaud Secretary Kerry and the president for trying to put together this agreement.
0.0	0.0285714285714	I think it was a mistake to expand Medicaid everywhere in Ohio and across the country.
0.0	0.0	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.0480769230769	But let me go back to something that's very important.
0.0	0.987951807229	However, we saved 80,000 jobs and we went on to grow to 160,000 jobs, and scores of technology companies literally went out of business -- like Gateway -- taking all their jobs with them.
0.0	1.0	And Mexico's going to pay for the wall because Mexico -- I love the Mexican people; I respect the Mexican leaders -- but the leaders are much sharper, smarter and more cunning than our leaders.
0.0	0.0	But the issue for us is to have a Congress that stands up and says not only no, but "Hell no" to this money going to a regime that is going to use it for terror, Susan Rice has said that, and we need to stand up and strongly and clearly tell the ayatollah that -- whoever the next president of the United States is going to be, and I'll promise you, if it's me, the first thing that I will do is tear up that agreement with Iran.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I believe I can get the money that I need by taxing the wealthy, by closing loopholes, the things that we are way overdue for doing.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Because we can't just save the American Dream, we can expand it to reach more people, and change more lives than ever before.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Or, are you going to deal with the problem by saying, I'm going to give people who've done well in this country less benefit on the backend.
0.0	0.0	They're taking money from Social Security and they're going to spend it on the military and they're going to spend it on domestic spending.
0.0	0.0480769230769	It's poor people and middle class.
0.0	0.0	We have a serious problem with, as you know, with radical Islam.
0.0	0.0	That is not protected religious belief.
0.0	0.0480769230769	This is a remarkable and horrifying fact.
0.0	0.0	Listen, I want to just comment.
0.0	0.0	We used to have 16 workers for one retiree, now you have three workers for one retiree.
0.0	1.0	... in addition to that, we go ahead and we take the oil from them, their source of revenue.
0.0	0.987951807229	So you know, I had to report results every 90 days in excruciating detail.
1.0	1.0	They don't want to pay 35 percent tax on the way back.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I agree, however, it doesn't go far enough, because what it focuses on are the big banks, which Senator Sanders has talked about a lot, for good reason.
1.0	0.987951807229	It is a simple flat tax where for individuals, a family of four pays nothing on the first $36,000.
0.0	1.0	They have a sophisticated understanding of our legal immigration system and we now have an obligation to ensure that they are not able to use that system against us.
0.0	1.0	That was not, as I understand it, the secretary's position.
0.0	0.0	And I'm going to tell you, that it -- I'm going to suggest to you here tonight, that you can't do on the job training.
0.0	0.0480769230769	We don't need to raise taxes to get this done.
0.0	0.0480769230769	You know, every election we hear a lot of talk.
0.0	0.987951807229	Under my plan, no business, big or small, will pay more than 25 percent flat rate on their business income.
0.0	1.0	Remember, we have 645 federal agencies and sub-agencies.
0.0	0.0	And the idea that this negotiation -- I will tell you one thing.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I am, but people are upset, and they're upset for a reason about the future of this country.
0.0	0.0	The student loan problem has been created by government.
0.0	1.0	And what I have concluded is that the best policy is to get rid of all government subsidies, and get the government out of our lives, and let people rise and fall based on how good they are.
0.0	0.0285714285714	Let me tell you, everybody, when they say they want to give it to you for free, keep your hands on your wallets because they're coming to you to pay for it.
0.0	0.0	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I will do so in a way that will bring people together.
0.0	1.0	in particular.
0.0	0.0480769230769	We have to eliminate the sequester, rebuild our military in a way that makes it clear that we're back in the game.
0.0	0.0	... that he tried to take credit for four years later.
0.0	0.0	He is a good man.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And I think together we will make progress.
0.0	1.0	Last I heard we lived in a democratic society.
0.0	0.0	We have a country of laws.
0.0	0.0	And secondly, when you talk about me being on the board of Lehman Brothers, I wasn't on the board of Lehman Brothers.
0.0	0.0480769230769	They worked hard to provide us the chance at a better life.
0.0	0.0	And if you're going to leave this to Hillary Clinton, the person who gave us this foreign policy, the architect of it, and you're going to give her another four years, that's why I'm speaking out as strongly as I am about that.
0.0	0.0	And Lehman Brothers started it all.
0.0	0.0	When you look at raising the debt limit, it should be leverage to try to reform government.
0.0	1.0	You know, that's what the PC culture is all about, and it's destroying this nation.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I think that is the real key here.
0.0	0.0480769230769	But, we can't rest.
0.0	0.0285714285714	We would still have LGBT people who get married on Saturday and get fired on Monday.
1.0	1.0	They cite Obamacare.
0.0	0.0	But, let me tell you who not to blame.
0.0	1.0	I would say that I would and I have a permit, which is very unusual in New York -- a permit to carry.
0.0	0.0	We owned a liquor store, restaurant, bar and we lived in the back.
0.0	1.0	That the Ayatollah is a radical jihadist who really means it when he chants, "Death to America, death to Israel."
1.0	0.987951807229	And we'll save a trillion dollars over the next 10 years.
0.0	0.0	I can govern by bringing people together.
0.0	0.0	But this is nothing new.
0.0	0.0	When I'm president of the United States we are getting rid of Obamacare and we are rebuilding our military.
0.0	0.0480769230769	They are devaluing -- it's so impossible for -- you look at Caterpillar Tractor and what's happening with Caterpillar and Kamatsu (ph).
0.0	0.0480769230769	We hear actually a lot of good intentions.
0.0	0.0480769230769	It was.
0.0	0.0285714285714	It would bring the money back into the United States to help build jobs by American companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about.
1.0	1.0	Ronald Regan opposed the value tax because he said it was a way to blindfold the people, so the true cost of government was not there there for them.
0.0	0.0	It's not the evil rich people.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Both Donald and Jeb have good points, and there is a middle ground.
0.0	0.0	Now, on that tariff -- here's what I'm saying, China -- they send their goods and we don't tax it -- they do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.0	My state is doing great across the board.
0.0	1.0	That's not the role of the government.
0.0	0.0285714285714	It turns out some dot wasn't connected, and so the first thing we have to do is make sure that everyone and every responsible agency is attuned to all of these possibilities and symptoms.
0.0	1.0	When I am president of the United States, I'm going to side with Ronald Regan on this and not Nancy Pelosi and we are not having a vat tax.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Right there, right next to the plant.
0.0	0.0	But we have a serious problem.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I think we need to be very careful with tariffs, and here's why.
0.0	0.0480769230769	But I like to be unpredictable so that people don't know exactly... (LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.0480769230769	Well, you know, I think, from a historical point of view, somebody with my background, somebody with my views, somebody who has spent his entire life taking on the big money interests, I think a Sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment, as well.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I like that.
0.0	0.987951807229	I have a proven record of success, 32 years in business, and 8 years as Governor of the state of Florida.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And for good cause.
0.0	0.0480769230769	What a president of the United States has got to do -- and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility -- is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe, that we work with allies around the world to protect...
0.0	0.0480769230769	I will continue to have tremendous admiration and respect for Governor Bush.
0.0	0.0	Now Maria, listen.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Thank you.
0.0	0.0	About Medicare?
0.0	0.0480769230769	I think it's -- yeah, I think it's a one-two punch.
0.0	1.0	Everybody said it was going to be three hours, three and a half, including them, and in about two minutes I renegotiated it so we can get the hell out of here.
0.0	1.0	Lots of people will say lots of different things about me in this campaign and others, but the one thing they've never said about me is that I'm misunderstood.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I like it.
0.0	0.0	There is no money in the Medicare account.
0.0	0.0	Like rich kids, they deserve to get a free education.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I would hold a Camp David summit with our Arab allies, not to talk them into this lousy deal with Iran, but to say to them, "what is it that you need to defeat ISIL?"
0.0	0.0480769230769	Alright.
0.0	0.0	I have no clue whether the federal government is the proper place, my instinct is to say, hell no, just about everything about the federal government.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Could I -- could I bring something up here, because I'm a constituent of the senator and I helped him and I expected that he would do constituent service, which means that he shows up to work.
0.0	1.0	When I was 21, my mom died.
0.0	0.0480769230769	This debate needs to be about the men and women across this country that are struggling on a daily basis to provide for their families the better future that we've always said this country is all about.
0.0	0.0	I will tell you that.
0.0	0.0	We're nowhere close to a balanced budget or fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And you talk so much that nobody can ever keep up with what you're saying is accurate or not.
0.0	1.0	I'd like to just mention something about my tax plan, and how it relates to the discussion...
0.0	0.0	She wouldn't just be a disaster, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being commander in chief of the United States.
0.0	0.0480769230769	The better way of dealing with this -- the better way of dealing with this is recognizing that there are people in, you know, the -- Islamic terrorists inside, embedded in refugee populations.
0.0	1.0	That is our government today.
0.0	0.0	Do we still have values and principles?
0.0	0.0480769230769	Do you remember when he ran for president of the United States, and he was a candidate, and he went and said, "These Americans with traditional values, they are bitter people, and they cling to their guns and to their religion."
0.0	0.0	We're going to combine all commercial activity in business into one place in the tax code and charge it 15 percent, which is going to suddenly make us competitive with the rest of the world.
1.0	1.0	Americans haven't had a raise in 15 years.
0.0	0.0	And if I am president and we get our hands on him, he is standing trial for treason.
0.0	1.0	Divisive and with no vision.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	1.0	And so that was his explanation.
0.0	1.0	That's 13,000 miles.
0.0	0.0480769230769	But getting back to Martha's question about how we end dependency, do we have to have a cultural change?
0.0	0.0480769230769	No, they don't like he beats the rest of the field, because they want me.
0.0	0.0	I'm running for president because there is no way we can elect Hillary Clinton to continue the policies of Barack Obama.
0.0	0.0	But, the real issue, I think, that the Senator is injecting into this is that if you had a Super PAC, like President Obama has, which now says it wants to support me.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I hope you will make a decision soon on this.
0.0	1.0	This is money that people have confiscated out of their paychecks.
0.0	0.0	We own a home four blocks away from the place that I grew up in.
0.0	0.0	That is important.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Well, this is going to be a show me, don't tell me election.
0.0	0.0480769230769	We need to come together as a country because we have to realize that America is great, not from the top-down.
0.0	0.987951807229	I would note, just for a historic aside, somebody told me earlier today we've had like 200 presidential primary debates, and this is the first time there have been a majority of women on the stage.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I know we have a president who wants to do whatever he wants to do, and take his pen and his phone and just tell everybody what he thinks is best.
0.0	0.0480769230769	So he had to leave the Situation Room after hearing from the small group advising him and he had to make that decision.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Why?
0.0	0.0480769230769	Well, I'm glad you asked that, Maria.
0.0	0.987951807229	But Maria, radical Islamic terrorism was not invented 24 months ago; 24 months ago, we had Al Qaida.
0.0	1.0	The president of the United States admitting that he's weakening our government's position, our foreign policy standing, because he can't control spending in D.C..
0.0	0.0480769230769	Why is that?
0.0	0.0480769230769	This guy is a petulant child.
0.0	0.0285714285714	Well, if the law would change, yeah.
0.0	0.0	I'm asking people to support me because I think I'm the most qualified, experienced, and ready person to be the president and the commander- in-chief.
0.0	0.0480769230769	So you should go out, get a declaratory judgment, let the courts decide.
0.0	1.0	I can see why people are angry and scared, because this president has created a condition where our national security has weakened dramatically.
0.0	0.0	It's not fear and terror, it's reality.
1.0	1.0	Who denies that African-American youth unemployment, real, is over 50 percent.
0.0	1.0	There is no other description of it.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Not everybody remembers that.
0.0	0.0	It is time for Republicans in D.C. to fight.
0.0	1.0	That's the difference.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Enough on fantasy football.
0.0	0.0	And you know what?
0.0	0.0	Yeah, I would go, first of all, one step further in this description of Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.0480769230769	We don't win.
0.0	1.0	Now, let me just be clear, John.
0.0	0.0480769230769	You know, in our country, there are a lot of people who feel as though they just don't have the power.
0.0	0.0480769230769	But realistically, even if they do, the money is flowing.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And I do carry on occasion, sometimes a lot.
0.0	0.0	I did it as the chairman of the Budget Committee, working with Senator Domenici.
0.0	0.0	Martha, we got a lot of politicians that will kiss babies, cut ribbons, do whatever it takes to be popular.
0.0	1.0	Have been ever since I was in the Senate.
0.0	0.987951807229	Marco stood today, standing on this stage Marco supports legalization and citizenship for 12 million illegals.
0.0	0.0	We're going dark when it comes to detecting the next attack.
0.0	1.0	First of all, John got lucky with a thing called fracking, OK?
0.0	0.0480769230769	And the fact of the matter is if we give them a mission and we don't tie their hands behind their back, they can get it accomplished.
0.0	0.0	But also where it's affordable, solar, wind in Iowa has become very affordable and it makes sense.
0.0	0.987951807229	We will use those proceeds, a hundred billion a year, to invest in rebuilding our infrastructure.
0.0	0.0	Yes, I'm going to do away with that.
0.0	0.0480769230769	... replacing dependency with opportunity.
0.0	0.0480769230769	You just want to...
0.0	0.0	He is -- this president is undermining the constitutional basis of this government.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Well, yes, indeed.
0.0	1.0	Here's the deal, Chris is totally right.
0.0	0.0	And when you have insider information, which apparently has been the case, where people use that information and use big data to try to take advantage of it, there has to be some regulation.
0.0	1.0	With all the candidates, why me?
0.0	0.0480769230769	We need a leader who will lead the resurgence of this great nation and unlock its potential once again.
0.0	0.0	And also, I've been tested in a way no one else has.
0.0	0.0480769230769	So I believe as president I will look very carefully about unintended consequences.
0.0	1.0	So, yes, I do believe that when we talk about public education in America, today, in a rapidly changing world, we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities.
0.0	0.0	And I just want to say, you know, last week we released our tax plan.
0.0	1.0	And the Obama-Clinton economy has left behind the working men and women of this country.
0.0	0.0	He was the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan.
0.0	0.0480769230769	People have worked their entire lives.
0.0	0.0480769230769	... believe me the world is peanuts by comparison.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Part of the reason why it hasn't risen because sometimes we're not giving people the skills they need.
0.0	1.0	They come from another country and they're immediately sent out.
0.0	0.0	If a person lives in a seven room house, does the government get to say you don't need seven rooms, we're going to take two of them away?
0.0	1.0	The wages that high school graduates receive today are significantly less, whether you are white or black, than they used to be.
0.0	0.0	Yeah, again, as I said, we're raising a family in the 21st century and it's one of the reasons why my tax plan is a pro- family tax plan.
0.0	0.0	Well, Secretary Clinton, you're not in the White House yet.
0.0	0.987951807229	I've heard them talk about deporting 10 or 11 -- people here from this country out of this country, splitting families.
0.0	0.0480769230769	You can't do that to the party.
1.0	1.0	Now, on the floor of the Congress, the Washington establishment from both parties puts forward a bill that will explode the deficit.
0.0	0.0	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.987951807229	My point is this: I won two landslide elections, I made big changes.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And, for those of us who are serious enough to run for president, think long and hard why we're here, and hopefully you'll know we're not here for ourselves.
0.0	1.0	I will show you what they do to women.
0.0	0.0	Yeah.
0.0	0.0480769230769	My father used to say, "Johnny, we never -- we don't hate the rich.
0.0	1.0	Not keeping the government open.
0.0	1.0	My name was mentioned.
0.0	1.0	She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video.
0.0	0.0	Is there an area for a safety net?
0.0	1.0	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.0	And she and I looked at the same evidence coming from the Bush administration regarding Iraq.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Everybody knows that.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Everyone up here tonight that's talking about reforms, I think and I know for myself I speak to this, we're all talking about reforms for future generations.
0.0	0.0285714285714	If you're worried about the world being on fire, you're worried about how we're going to use our military, you're worried about strengthening our military and you're worried most of all about keeping your homes and your families safe and secure, you cannot give Hillary Clinton a third term of Barack Obama's leadership.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Focus on the diseases that are costing us the trillions of dollars.
0.0	0.0	Yes, they have to stop being the main state sponsor of terrorism.
1.0	0.987951807229	1.5 million jobs created during the worst economic time this country has had since the Great Depression while the rest of the country lost 400,000 jobs.
0.0	0.0285714285714	I'm looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.987951807229	I built a net worth of way over $10 billion, and I have done it four times out of hundreds.
0.0	0.0	Unintended consequences.
0.0	0.0	We have to work with NATO to protect Eastern Europe against any kind of Russian aggression.
0.0	1.0	If you're running for president of the United States and you do not understand that we cannot defend this nation without more of our soldiers over there, you are not ready for this job.
0.0	0.0480769230769	So...
0.0	0.0285714285714	But view is those trade policies have enabled corporate America to shut down in this country, throw millions of people out on the street.
0.0	0.0480769230769	(inaudible).
0.0	0.0285714285714	And when we live by those laws and we treat everybody equally under the law, that's when people feel good about being Americans.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I believe we are on the path to doing that.
1.0	1.0	And Iranian wise guys having guns to their heads.
0.0	1.0	She actually ran against one of my friends and our head of public safety.
0.0	0.0	I'm the only one on this stage that has a plan that would create jobs, cut taxes, balance the budget and can get it done because I'm realistic.
0.0	0.0480769230769	The problem is we never get it done.
0.0	1.0	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.0	There are other racial discrepancies.
0.0	0.0	King Abdullah of Jordan, a man I've known for a long time, has been asking for bombs and materiel.
0.0	1.0	They're going to end up in the productive economy, which is where we want them.
0.0	1.0	This president -- and, by the way, Secretary Clinton, who called Assad a reformer -- she called Assad a reformer.
0.0	0.0	You've got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	1.0	It's a blessing that we're living longer, so we have to increase the retirement age to reflect that blessing.
0.0	0.0285714285714	The reality is that both the African-American community and the white community do marijuana at about equal rates.
0.0	0.0	You have got to pick somebody who has experience, somebody that has the know-how, the discipline.
0.0	0.0	Carl said, "no, no -- " but he's somebody -- these are the kind of people that we should use to negotiate and not the China people that we have who are political hacks who don't know what they're doing and we have problems like this.
0.0	0.0480769230769	So, yes, we can talk about it as a racial issue.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Listen, we -- this is the greatest country in the history of mankind.
0.0	0.0285714285714	You know, everyone here talks about the need to take on Washington.
0.0	0.0480769230769	So I believe that working with Europe -- and, by the way, you know, we've got some very wealthy countries there in that part of the world.
0.0	0.0285714285714	And, you know, there are a number of programs that I think are duplicative and redundant and not producing the results that people deserve.
0.0	0.0	In the same light, as the foreign leader, Winston Churchill's politics were not my politics.
0.0	0.0	That's how you go from secretary to CEO.
0.0	1.0	Big government favors the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected, and crushes the small and the powerless.
0.0	0.0	Let me say, I read that editorial today with a great amusement.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Because that's what we'd get if it were Jeb -- I tell you what, we don't need that.
0.0	0.0	We have got to make sure that local police departments look like the communities they serve in their diversity.
0.0	0.0285714285714	...and be held accountable.
0.0	1.0	There is no president, in my view, not Hillary Clinton, not Bernie Sanders, who has the capability or the power to take on Wall Street, large campaign donors, the corporate media, the big money interests in this country alone.
0.0	1.0	... the American middle class, and who are being attacked by ideologues, by demagogues.
0.0	0.0	So what if children are going hungry?
0.0	0.0	I want a government so small I can barely see it.
0.0	0.0	-- work better to lift everyone up, men and women.
0.0	0.0	I try to live by the rules, no matter what they are, and I was brought up that way as a kid.
0.0	1.0	I will put a price tag.
0.0	0.0	That is a dramatic tax decrease for hard-working people who run their own businesses.
0.0	1.0	Those jobs, in many cases, are now gone.
0.0	1.0	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	1.0	With grandiose language, the president talks about red lines and nothing to follow it up; talks about ISIS being the JV team, they form a caliphate the size of Indiana with 35 (thousand) to 40,000 battle-tested terrorists.
0.0	0.0480769230769	As you too know, I know I built a very great company.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I'll tell you what else people are concerned about.
0.0	0.0	I used the laws of the country to my benefit, I'm sorry.
0.0	1.0	...Chris...
0.0	0.987951807229	There is one major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	1.0	And guess what, in 2011, I got a deal...
0.0	0.0	He undermines it.
0.0	0.0	That's what he talked about, the great threat of China.
0.0	0.0	And I make a lot more than the average American.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I find -- I mean, it's just a very different, you know, historical perspective here.
0.0	0.0	We're a country of laws, not of men, not of people who do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Look, the -- the deal is already done.
0.0	0.0	It's never been that way in American politics before.
0.0	0.0	That's just a fact, and that's what Donald Trump taps into.
0.0	0.0	Senator Sanders, from a debate in 2008, quote what I said.
0.0	0.0	And, Jim, you know full well that in the seven years I was U.S. attorney we went after pharmaceutical companies.
0.0	0.0	We're running.
0.0	1.0	I do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination to succeed President Obama.
0.0	0.0	And by the way, Jeb you mentioned Boeing, take a look.
0.0	1.0	I'm angry because our country is a mess.
0.0	0.0	We pay federal taxes.
0.0	1.0	This president, this president is more interested in funding -- less interested in funding the military, than he is in funding planned -- he's more interested in funding Planned Parenthood than he is in funding the military.
0.0	0.0	That is who I'm fighting for.
0.0	0.0480769230769	It did not come from our Judeo-Christian roots, I can tell you that.
0.0	1.0	We've got 11 million undocumented people in this country.
0.0	0.0480769230769	They don't like that.
0.0	1.0	She wants to continue down the path of Iran, Benghazi, the Russian reset, Dodd-Frank, all the things that have -- that have gone wrong in this country, she would be a national security mess.
0.0	0.0	President Obama and I are friends.
0.0	0.0	John.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Let's hope that it holds.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Think about that.
0.0	0.987951807229	Look, the -- the simple fact is that my plan actually gives the middle class the greatest break: $2,000 per family.
0.0	1.0	Well, and specifically to Medicare, Becky, because 85 percent of the cost of Medicare is chronic disease.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I just want to thank all my colleagues here for being civil, and not falling for the traps.
0.0	1.0	So we have a disagreement on this.
1.0	1.0	Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan.
0.0	0.0	It's a political Justice Department.
0.0	1.0	It's called the value added tax.
0.0	1.0	I had to borrow money to go to school.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I think you do have a humanitarian tragedy there, as I mentioned a moment ago.
0.0	0.0	We should put the NSA in charge of the civilian side of this as well.
0.0	0.0480769230769	They're not my ideas, and I don't necessarily agree with all of them.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.0480769230769	We can't do this unilaterally.
0.0	0.0	Just know where you want to go, stick to your guts.
0.0	1.0	You know, Obama has presented the American people with a false choice every time.
0.0	0.0480769230769	You're an American, as is everybody else on this stage, and I would suggest we focus on who's best prepared to be commander- in-chief, because that's the most important question facing the country.
0.0	0.0	Because Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama.
0.0	0.0	This is incredibly complicated, because we've got Iran as a big player, in addition to Russia.
0.0	0.0	And you know what?
0.0	0.0480769230769	This issue now has to be about stopping ISIS entering the United States, and when I'm president we will.
0.0	1.0	Or that we're just going to be great?
0.0	0.0	We got rid of Gadhafi.
0.0	0.0	So you know the New York Times and I don't have exactly have the warmest of relationships.
0.0	0.0480769230769	The fact is -- and if for some reason he beats the rest of the field, he beats the rest of the field (inaudible).
0.0	0.0	What we should do is to be investing in all types of energy, John, all types of energy.
0.0	0.0480769230769	It's the only way to level the playing field between big and powerful and small and powerless.
0.0	0.0480769230769	They are much more than that.
0.0	1.0	A Republican Congress did that.
0.0	0.0285714285714	When millions of Americans rose up against Planned Parenthood, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I want to reverse that decline.
0.0	1.0	Here, we actually need 1,000 because we have natural barriers.
0.0	0.0	I'm going to do what it takes to defend this nation.
0.0	0.0480769230769	The talk has got to stop, the action has got to begin.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Those are the things we brought, and we were able to get things done.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Why in God's name does Wall Street make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.987951807229	Almost 60 percent of American people now need to hire an expert to understand their taxes.
0.0	1.0	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.0285714285714	And then, after the war, this is the guy who, in fact, yes, you're right, he opened up relations with China, and now pushed various type of trade agreements, resulting in American workers losing their jobs as corporations moved to China.
0.0	1.0	We have ISIS and al Qaeda attacking us.
0.0	0.0480769230769	... with what Marco is saying is that it takes too long, they're sucking us dry and it takes too long.
0.0	0.0480769230769	We took it away from the NSA, it was a bad decision by the president.
0.0	0.0480769230769	The rest of the world is moving away from us towards other alliances because we are weak.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I'm happy to answer the question...
0.0	0.0	Thanks for coming back to me, Maria.
0.0	1.0	This isn't free money.
0.0	0.0480769230769	It would just -- you absolutely have to get involved with China, they are taking so much of what we have in terms of jobs in terms of money.
0.0	0.0	Nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with.
0.0	0.0	I'm wearing a Trump tie tonight.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I will stand firm.
0.0	1.0	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.0	I did a couple of speeches for them, I do speeches for other people.
0.0	1.0	We have -- wait a second, we have $19 trillion in debt.
0.0	1.0	No Wall Street executive has been prosecuted.
0.0	0.0	I'm not blaming Chris, by the way, but he will know about that.
0.0	0.0480769230769	It's very important we focus on the threats we face today, and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in.
0.0	0.0	Now, I can tell you there are a lot of private-sector things that you could do with $12,500, which will get you a lot more than you get from this government program.
0.0	0.0480769230769	You've got a bit of experience, I would imagine.
0.0	1.0	I want security.
0.0	1.0	They are radicalizing people in the United States, they are conducting attacks around the world.
0.0	0.0480769230769	You really can't.
0.0	0.0480769230769	He doesn't want to get people together, the old-fashioned way, where you get Congress.
0.0	1.0	On the issue of Barack Obama, Barack Obama does not believe that America is a great global power.
0.0	0.0480769230769	But also the biggest people (ph) -- now I've used that to my advantage as a business man, for my family, for myself.
0.0	0.0	You're welcome.
0.0	1.0	John Harwood, there's a bigger issue here.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And I want to just suggest to you.
0.0	0.987951807229	These folks, CNBC, they had it down at three, three and a half hours.
0.0	1.0	Or how about Boeing right here within a mile?
0.0	0.0480769230769	A lot of interesting issues have come together.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I know what it's like to owe that money, and we've worked hard.
0.0	0.0480769230769	We will work with our Sunni allies.
0.0	0.0285714285714	We hear a lot of good plans.
0.0	1.0	We've saved billions of dollars.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And I think Ted Kennedy had a very clear idea about what needed to be done.
0.0	1.0	If there's an act of violence in America, his immediate answer before he even knows the facts is gun control.
0.0	0.0	I have yet to see a proposal that you're describing that the -- raising the cap would apply to passive income.
0.0	0.0480769230769	That's what they do, whether it's the San Bernardino attack or if it's these tragedies that take place, I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is.
0.0	0.0480769230769	If a soldier has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.987951807229	I just read today in the New York Times, $250,000 for a 30 second ad.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And worse -- worse yet, to be honest with you, Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster.
0.0	0.0285714285714	And here in Wisconsin, I want to reiterate: We've got to stand up for unions and working people who have done it before...
0.0	0.0480769230769	They want a political revolution in which millions of Americans stand up, come together, not let the Trumps of the world divide us, and say, you know what, in this great country, we need a government that represents all of us, not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.
0.0	1.0	What we have to do is end over-policing in African- American neighborhoods.
0.0	0.0	Not trustworthy.
0.0	0.642857142857	We cut taxes and we had a $5 trillion projected surplus when I left.
0.0	1.0	Well, Neil, I'm glad we're focusing on the important topics of the evening.
0.0	0.0	Got 70 votes in the United States Senate.
0.0	0.0	That is very different than talking about specific action for regime change, which I did not support.
0.0	1.0	It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are.
0.0	0.0	At least he's honest enough to call himself a socialist.
0.0	1.0	We cannot be the world's policeman.
1.0	1.0	And I've done it when I was in Washington when we had a balanced budget; had four years of balanced budgets; paid down a half-trillion of debt.
0.0	0.0480769230769	... that, having been in the trenches fighting for this, I believe strongly we have to guarantee health care.
1.0	1.0	Everybody voted for it wanting to see Libya move toward democracy, of course we all wanted to do that.
0.0	0.0480769230769	We need to get back in the game as it relates to our Arab nations.
0.0	1.0	Hillary Clinton lies about Benghazi, she lies about e- mails.
0.0	1.0	I've watched to see people say that we should dismantle Medicare and Medicaid and leave the senior citizens out -- out in the -- in the cold.
0.0	0.0	Yes, does Wall Street and big financial interests, along with drug companies, insurance companies, big oil, all of it, have too much influence?
0.0	0.0	Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, they're no better.
1.0	0.0	Believe me, that is why Ohio is doing well.
1.0	1.0	I would note that Art Laffer, Ronald Reagan's chief economic adviser, has written publicly, that my simple flat tax is the best tax plan of any of the individuals on this stage cause it produces economic growth, it raises wages and it helps everyone from the very poorest to the very richest.
0.0	1.0	And when America does not lead, the world is a dangerous and a tragic place.
0.0	1.0	And the world's financial system is on the verge of collapse.
0.0	0.0	Because when government gets big and powerful, the big feel like they need to get even bigger to deal with all that power, and meanwhile, the small and the powerless -- in this case, 1,590 community banks -- go out of business.
0.0	0.0	And we are going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fall.
0.0	0.0	I would hope that we could all agree that we are sick and tired of seeing videos on television of unarmed people, often African-Americans, shot by police officers.
0.0	1.0	And the last piece is this.
0.0	0.0	Now, I find it rather amazing, because I happen to believe that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country.
0.0	0.0	I've set forth very specific plans about how to get costs down, especially prescription drug costs.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Terrorism is on the run, China, Russia is advancing their agenda at warp speed, and we pull back.
0.0	0.0	This is a bad deal.
0.0	1.0	But in terms of shutting down the government, I don't think President Obama should choose to shut down the government simply to send taxpayer dollars to this group that has been caught, I believe, breaking the law, but also offending our values and our ethics.
0.0	0.0	And his explanation -- he said, "look, I'm from New York, that's what we believe in New York.
0.0	0.0	You gotta be -- stick with it, and all that.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Thank you.
0.0	0.0	John?
0.0	1.0	The only way we're going to defund Planned Parenthood is have a pro-life president.
0.0	1.0	They're a feeding frenzy for sick people.
0.0	0.0480769230769	You know the nice thing about the mainstream media, they don't hide their views.
0.0	0.0	Wait for what?
0.0	0.0	Don't vote for me if you want to keep the gridlock in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.0	The Koch Brothers have a very clear political agenda.
0.0	0.0	Bill, I defeated Mario Cuomo.
0.0	0.0	But here's the real key.
0.0	0.0480769230769	It's not that hard.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And, you know, we have a whole variety of things that they can do and they can do these things simultaneously.
0.0	1.0	If we were to expand Medicaid, for every uninsured person we would cover, we'd kick more than one person out of private insurance or remove their opportunity to get private insurance.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you better get rid of the SuperPacs because they causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that have been made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.0	We have to provide the NATO support to back up the mission that is going on.
0.0	0.987951807229	Today congress decided to take another $150 billion dollars away from Social Security so they can borrow more money.
1.0	1.0	And this is not the first time that he has criticized President Obama.

0.0	0.0480769230769	Let me tell you, if we don't get this election right, there may be no turning back for America.
0.0	0.0	Well, this is one of the reasons why Tom Perkins and I had disagreements in the boardroom, Becky.
0.0	0.0	You lead and you produce results.
0.0	1.0	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.0	There's only a promise to pay by the next generation, and the next generation's not big enough to pay it.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Now I think an area in kind of a vague way, or not so vague, where Secretary Clinton and I disagree is the area of regime change.
0.0	0.0	My background is different.
0.0	1.0	Last I heard, a United States senator had the right to disagree with the president, including a president who has done such an extraordinary job.
0.0	1.0	But we're running for the presidency of the United States here.
0.0	0.0480769230769	We need leadership, someone who has a backbone and sticks with things, rather than just talks about them as though anything matters when you're talking about amendments that don't even actually are part of a bill that ever passed.
0.0	1.0	I am passionate about what I believe.
0.0	1.0	He is undermining our standing in the world.
0.0	0.0	Hillary Clinton cannot be president.

0.0	1.0	And meanwhile, small businesses are getting crushed.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Good question, but I want to tell you, my great concern is that we are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job.
0.0	0.0	Donald Trump actually seized on it when he talked about immigration.
0.0	0.0	We've got a president who cannot bring himself to say the words "radical Islamic terrorism."

0.0	0.0	I've got one more question for you then.
0.0	0.0	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.0	Well, first of all, I didn't say that the rate would be 10 percent.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And I said, "Didn't you resent America for not letting you be with your father in those formative and very threatening years?"
0.0	0.0480769230769	We're running surpluses.
0.0	0.0480769230769	In fact, frankly, he's complaining about the fact that we're losing some of the most talented people.
0.0	0.0480769230769	But judgment matters as well.
1.0	0.987951807229	We owe $19 trillion, boy am I good at solving debt problems.
0.0	0.987951807229	I do not believe a vote in 2002 is a plan to defeat ISIS in 2016.

0.0	0.0	So let's start -- let's start with immigration.
0.0	0.0	Low income people who are not involved in the political process.
0.0	0.987951807229	And you know, when you see Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and all the Democrats talking about wanting to address the plight of working women, not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama, 3.7 million women have entered poverty.
0.0	1.0	But if you want someone who has a proven, effective leadership, that was a governor of a state, that transformed the culture there, elect me so I can fight for the American people and change the culture in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.0480769230769	This isn't -- this isn't, you know, a different kind of job.

0.0	0.0	Because, first of all, you may rename the IRS but you are not going to abolishes the IRS, because there has to be some agency that's going to collect your vat tax.
0.0	0.0285714285714	People are being released from jail without the education, without the job training, without the resources that they need to get their lives together, then they end up -- we're shocked that they end up back in jail again.
0.0	0.0	He was such a nice guy.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Everybody is really doing some bad fact...
0.0	0.0	Let me -- let me answer your question on the Sun-Sentinel editorial today.
0.0	0.0	I got that.
0.0	0.987951807229	I was the chairman of the National Commission on Homeland Security and Terrorism for the United States for five years.
0.0	0.0285714285714	What we have got to do is make it clear that any police officer who breaks the law will, in fact, be held accountable.
0.0	1.0	In addition to that...
0.0	0.0285714285714	I'm asking folks not just to join my campaign, but join a cause.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Number -- and that is important for you to know.
0.0	0.0480769230769	First of all, I'd like to recognize Governor Haley for her incredible leadership in the aftermath of the --
0.0	0.0480769230769	They lost a lot of money, everybody said it couldn't be done.
0.0	0.987951807229	And you combine that with a plan to make manufacturing -- this country number one in manufacturing, you've got someone who's going to help revitalize and give hope to America, the place -- the place is that is the most hopeless today.
0.0	0.0	That is not what America is supposed to be about.
0.0	0.0480769230769	He doesn't meet -- here's the difference.
0.0	0.0	The American people have rejected your agenda and now you're trying to go around it.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I cannot tell you how much our nation is threatened and how we need a commander in chief who understands the threats to this nation.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And I give you my word, if I am elected president, no service man or service woman will be forced to be on their knees, and any nation that captures our fighting men will feel the full force and fury of the United States of America.
0.0	0.0480769230769	This is what's going on.
0.0	1.0	Because only if it's about three pages are you leveling the playing field between the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected who can hire the armies of lawyers and accountants and, yes, lobbyists to help them navigate their way through 73,000 pages.
0.0	0.0285714285714	It will never happen because they'll let their currency go up.
0.0	0.0	I think we need to do a lot more than we're doing.
0.0	0.0	Look, we have to stop with political correctness.
0.0	1.0	The Syrians should stay in Syria.
0.0	0.0	They're looking -- they're looking to manipulate our -- the visa waiver countries to get people into the United States.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And, thank you everybody.
0.0	1.0	When you became president, you had a Democratic Congress and a filibuster-proof Democratic Senate.
0.0	0.0	We even had warnings about the Boston Marathon bombers, and yet the dots weren't connected.
0.0	0.0	Secretary Clinton, I do have a disagreement here.
0.0	0.0	I've got a track record.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Now, when it mattered, he stood up and took on Wall Street.
0.0	1.0	Under -- under Barack Obama and the proposals of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and others, they've tried it their way, and it has failed miserably.
0.0	0.0	I didn't get a phone call from Bill Clinton before I jumped in the race.
0.0	0.0	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.0480769230769	We just can't do it any longer.
0.0	0.0	That is what I could do for the country.
0.0	1.0	We're up 347,000 jobs.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Such a nasty -- such a nasty question, but thank you, Governor.
1.0	1.0	Very few children.
0.0	0.0	I have many friends that deal with China.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Thank you.
0.0	0.987951807229	I don't agree that we're going to occupy and spend another decade or a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.0	In that State of the Union, President Obama didn't so much as mention the 10 sailors that had been captured by Iran.
0.0	0.0	But I recall when Secretary Clinton ran against then-Senator Obama, she was critical of him for suggesting that maybe you want to talk to Iran, that you want to talk to our enemies.
0.0	0.0	If we had guns in California on the other side where the bullets went in the different direction, you wouldn't have 14 or 15 people dead right now.
0.0	0.0	And I will assure you, as the governor of the state of Texas, and as those last four years have shown me, the preparation to be ready to stand on this stage and talk about those monetary policies, those domestic policies, and those foreign policies, Americans are going to see that I am ready to be that individual.
0.0	1.0	We've got to stop this culture of government dependence.
0.0	1.0	We're going to cut Social Security to help you.
0.0	0.0	Do you think that the Chinese, if they had a 45 percent tariff imposed on all their imports wouldn't retaliate and start buying Airbus?
0.0	1.0	You will begin to see jobs created in a robust economy.
0.0	1.0	They are a sophisticated purveyor of propaganda, a celebrator of violence, an instigator of attacks using their online presence.
0.0	0.0	I am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of Vermont from very significant majorities of women.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And why?
0.0	0.0480769230769	No their not.
0.0	0.0	Well, there is no evidence that they can fix anything in Washington, D.C.
1.0	0.0	If you look at a single mom buying groceries, she sees hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent.
0.0	0.0	It was a back sacrifice, and I have to hand it to Ben.
0.0	0.0285714285714	Well, let's just -- let's just follow up on this, because, you know, I've made it very clear that no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail, and because of Dodd-Frank, we now have in law a process that the president, the Federal Reserve, and others can use if any bank poses a systemic risk.
0.0	0.0480769230769	So if we want to pick and choose -- and I certainly do -- people I listen to, people I don't listen to, people I listen to for certain areas, then I think we have to be fair and look at the entire world, because it's a big, complicated world out there.
0.0	0.0480769230769	We need a fighter for this country again.
0.0	1.0	...The only way we're going to be morale, the only way we're going to keep our promise to seniors is start by following the first rule we should all follow, which is to look at them, treat them like adults, and tell them the truth.
0.0	0.0	If somebody's already stolen money from you, are you going to give them more?
0.0	0.0480769230769	Let me be clear.
0.0	1.0	That's all I'm saying.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I know this, I certainly am.
0.0	0.987951807229	President Obama's preparing to send $100 billion or more to the Ayatollah Khamenei.
1.0	1.0	It enabled him -- the president to certify them en masse without mandating meaningful background checks.
0.0	0.0480769230769	That's what we need.
0.0	0.0	We're going to save Social Security, and we're going to save Medicare.
0.0	0.0285714285714	Look, I am deeply concerned about what's happening in every community in America, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths.
0.0	0.0	There was nothing to this birther issue.
0.0	1.0	I will deliver for the American people if I have the privilege of leading this country.
0.0	0.0	Yes, it's very simple.
0.0	0.0	I'm not fighting that.
0.0	1.0	And finally, on health care, why don't we start treating -- keep giving...
0.0	0.987951807229	And I think that the record of the governor of the last 14 years of the 12th largest economy in the world is just the medicine America is looking for.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Hardworking immigrant families living in fear, who should be brought out of the shadows so they and their children can have a better future.
0.0	1.0	I'm a Catholic, I believe life begins at conception.
0.0	0.987951807229	And the net result is the middle class has $2,300 less in their pockets than the day that Barack Obama got elected president.
0.0	0.0480769230769	The last thing we need is to throw our country into a contentious debate about health care again.
0.0	0.0	And some of them, I will say, not all, have called me and said, "Donald, thank you very much; you're exposing an unbelievable problem and we have to get to the bottom of it."
0.0	1.0	But I -- the struggle of single moms is extraordinary.
0.0	0.0	The government is not supposed to be in every part of our lives, and that is what is causing the problem.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I think we should do both.
0.0	1.0	As you know, he came to Vermont to campaign for me when he was a senator.
0.0	0.0	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.0480769230769	But the good news is the next commander-in-chief is standing on this stage.
0.0	1.0	One thing I like to remind people is, back in 2007, Rudy Giuliani was leading the polls for almost a year.
0.0	1.0	I looked at the intelligence.
0.0	0.0	But let me also tell you, one of the issues has got to be the integration of both community and police.
0.0	1.0	People can promise you something, I delivered in the blue state of New York.
1.0	0.987951807229	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.0	...is the lowest personal rate any candidate up here has, and what it would also enable us to do is for every citizen to fill out their taxes on a postcard so we can eliminate the IRS.
0.0	0.0	I am a conservative because I know our values, our principles and our policies --
1.0	1.0	It looked like very few women.
0.0	0.0480769230769	We need to re-establish the relationships with the Sunnis.
0.0	0.0	Our legal immigration system from now on has to be merit-based.
0.0	0.0480769230769	That is like shouting "fire" in a crowded theater, and that is illegal, and I would do everything in our power not just to go after those who are here who we know who are here, before they can radicalize other Americans to carry out attacks, and it's not just the ones they've arrested.
0.0	0.0	And I'm the only one up on this stage who back in April put forward a detailed entitlement reform plan that will save over $1 trillion, save Social Security, save Medicare, and avoid this -- avoid what Hillary Rodham Clinton will do to you.
0.0	1.0	And therefore, they don't get the income tax break, but their prices are going to be higher, because the vat tax is embedded in both the prices that business that are charging and in the wages they pay their employees.
1.0	1.0	But I want to -- I want to follow up on something having to do with leadership, because, you know, today Senator Sanders said that President Obama failed the presidential leadership test.
0.0	0.0480769230769	You can't have a question.
0.0	0.0	I'm the only person on this stage that actually was involved in the chief architect of balancing the Federal Budget.
0.0	0.0	So there's a lot of balanced interests.
0.0	1.0	I never said that.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Our friends no longer think we have their back and our enemies no longer fear us, and we're in a much difficult -- we're in a much different position than we should be.
0.0	1.0	In terms of Saudi Arabia, look, my biggest problem with them is they're funding radical clerics through their madrasses.
0.0	1.0	I have talked to some of the young kids with tears rolling down their cheeks, are scared to death that today they may or their parents may be deported.
0.0	0.0	That makes no sense to everybody.
0.0	0.0480769230769	You've got to keep asking because this is a hugely important issue.
0.0	0.0	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And you shouldn't have mentioned the polls because I would have been much...
0.0	0.0480769230769	I think that would have been right, as well.
0.0	0.0	The Democrats' answer to everything is more government control over wages, and more empowering trial lawyers to file lawsuits.
0.0	1.0	I have a bill to fix Medicare.
1.0	0.987951807229	And by the way, when I left, there were over 1 million fewer people on welfare in New York state than when I took office...
0.0	1.0	Because they're recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees.
0.0	0.0480769230769	...
0.0	0.0480769230769	That tells you right away where he was headed on all of this.
0.0	0.0	You know, you go to the internet, you start reading an article and you go to the comments section -- you cannot go five comments down before people are calling each all manner of names.
0.0	0.0	In fact, we need to -- wait a minute -- we need vigilance.
0.0	0.0480769230769	But the key thing that we're seeing now is serious challenges to this country that must change, the direction of this nation must change.
0.0	0.0	Yes, I might feel more comfortable.
0.0	1.0	So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States.
0.0	0.0	And so do I.
1.0	0.987951807229	I am tired of sending $300 billion overseas to buy oil from people who hate our guts.
0.0	0.987951807229	Last week in a CNN town hall, the Senator told a questioner that the questioner would spend about $500 dollars in taxes to get about $5,000 dollars in healthcare.
0.0	1.0	Senator Sanders voted against it at that time.
0.0	1.0	He has never defended...
0.0	0.0480769230769	The first thing is we have to strengthen our alliances around the world.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Every time he's got a chance, going all the way back to -- remember that Great Beer Summit he had after he messed up that time.
0.0	0.0	The millionaires and billionaires are doing great under Obama.
0.0	0.0	It worked for Reagan and it works for our team in Ohio.
0.0	0.987951807229	That comes out to $12,500 for each one.
0.0	0.0	The fact is that this Justice Department under this president has been a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And I was going to tell you, whether I'm president or not, we better make it clear to the Saudis that we're going to support you, we're in relation with you just like we were in the first Gulf War, but you've got to knock off the funding and teaching of radical clerics who are the very people who try to destroy us and will turn around and destroy them.
0.0	0.0	The Kurds are our strongest allies.
0.0	0.0480769230769	My plan would sweep all of them into a regulatory framework so we can try to get ahead of what the next problems might be.
0.0	1.0	Yes, they have to stop trying to destabilize the Middle East, causing even more chaos.
0.0	1.0	That's not true.
1.0	1.0	I think under President Obama we have seen a lot of advances, the Affordable Care Act has helped more African Americans than any other group to get insurance, to be taken care of, but we also know a lot more than we did.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Thank you.
0.0	0.0	It's a problem all over the world.
0.0	1.0	In fact, if my mother were secretary of treasury, we would not be in a deficit situation.
0.0	0.0	If even in Paris, if they had guns on the other side, going in the opposite direction, you wouldn't have 130 people plus dead.
0.0	0.6	Of course not.
0.0	0.0	You don't have seven children and bring them into this world if you're not optimistic about the future of this country.
0.0	0.0480769230769	We had this failed red line with Assad and it discouraged folks that want to help us on the ground.
0.0	0.0	What -- what -- you're from New York?
0.0	0.0480769230769	I absolutely would call on them to collaborate and cooperate, yes.
0.0	0.0	And on this issue of the Medicare in particular, it's important because they're going to demagogue what we're saying here tonight.
0.0	0.987951807229	Well, first of all, this is an issue that's been debated now for 30 years.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And I agree about the role that he played both in war and in peace on the economy and defeating fascism around the world.
0.0	1.0	And, you know, for six-and-a-half years, we've had a gigantic party.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And I will tell you something that really galls me.
0.0	0.0	And Turkey, by the way, did a very decent thing, providing what was reasonable housing and conditions for those people.
0.0	0.0480769230769	We also want to dominate this from a commercial side.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I believe that we have got to move toward a path toward citizenship.
1.0	1.0	I have vetoed a reduction this clip size.
0.0	0.0285714285714	Because so many people in my family worked in steel mills, and they didn't work with a white collar, they worked in a blue collar.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world.
0.0	0.0480769230769	They are more likely to know what's happening in their families and their communities, and they need to feel not just invited, but welcomed within the American society.
0.0	1.0	In fact, I was all for you until you started doing that, because that's a misrepresentation, number one.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I may not be your dream candidate just yet, but I can assure you I am Hillary Clinton's worst nightmare.
0.0	1.0	Well, let us level with the American people.
0.0	1.0	America was worth the wait.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And in that meeting, I suggested we had a problem with technology, and that I wanted to take people from Silicon Valley into the Pentagon to solve our most significant problems.
0.0	0.0	I came as a reformer.
0.0	1.0	But in the interim, in the absence of that, what's happening is some of these tech companies are taking those -- those centers (ph) to Canada because they can get people to go over there instead of here.
0.0	1.0	The most powerful intelligence agency in the world is going to tell us where we are, the most powerful military in the world is going to destroy them.
0.0	0.0	Maria...
0.0	1.0	But I knew that good people who wanted to be a part of the American dream have become trapped in dependency because the federal government and the state government had made it in their economic interest not to take a job because the benefits that they didn't work were better.
0.0	0.0	It begins with tax reform.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.0480769230769	We are not the world's policeman, but we need to stand up and be ready.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Maria, let me clear something up here.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Well, I was a conservative governor of Virginia, I governed that way, and that's my track record.
0.0	0.0	We had a decision to make early on, do we do a Super PAC?
0.0	0.0	And I went to one of these Turkish refugee camps right on the border of Syria.
0.0	0.0	Let me say first that it is disturbing that every time one of these home-grown terrorist attacks occurs, and, as your question points out, they are occurring with far too great frequency, it turns out we had warning signals.
0.0	0.0	And for 30 years, the issue of immigration has been about someone who's in this country, maybe they're here illegally, but they're looking for a job.
0.0	0.0	No, not at all, absolutely not.
0.0	0.0	This is the fantasy...
0.0	0.0285714285714	So many companies are going to leave our country.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.0285714285714	You get the Congress, you get the Senate, you get together, you do legislation.
0.0	0.0	So -- you know, you shouldn't misrepresent how well you're doing with the polls.
0.0	0.0	It's time for real substance and real experience.
0.0	0.0	They're absolutely false.
0.0	0.0	I want to be in -- I want America to be the best...
0.0	1.0	In many ways, a college degree today is equivalent to what a high school degree was 50, 60 years ago.
0.0	0.0	When I'm president of the United States, we are defending the Second Amendment, not undermining it the way Barack Obama does.
0.0	0.0	We both believe there has to be more money going into the Social Security system.
0.0	0.0480769230769	He doesn't understand the threat in ISIS.
0.0	1.0	Thousands of people killed, and the cleanup started the next day, and it was the most horrific cleanup, probably in the history of doing this, and in construction.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I just hope that by the end of this campaign there will be a lot more supporting me.
0.0	0.0480769230769	You can have him.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And let me say this also.
0.0	1.0	This is extraordinary.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I find it very, very hard to forgive people that deceived me.
0.0	0.0	Nobody wants to watch three and a half, or three hours.
0.0	0.0	I'm going to get a response to that, Neil.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And what a sad sight that was: Men, women, children forced out of their homes.
0.0	0.0	You know why three?
0.0	0.0	Doesn't hurt rich people if their bar of soap goes up ten cents, but it hurts the poor and the middle class.
0.0	0.0	No, I think the idea was that president -- then-Senator Obama was wrong for suggesting that it is a good idea to talk to your opponents.
0.0	0.0	Because, I've got to tell you the truth, even in New Jersey what you're doing is called rude.
0.0	0.0480769230769	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.0480769230769	They can solve the problem of North Korea if they wanted to but they taunt us.
0.0	0.987951807229	Three million women have fallen into poverty under this administration.
1.0	1.0	The blurb said that the next president of the United States has got to be aggressive in bringing people into the political process.
0.0	1.0	So when they -- be found against that country that's selling products in here lower than the cost of what it takes to produce them, then what do we tell the worker?
0.0	0.0480769230769	Here's the problem.
0.0	1.0	But I'm not worried about my finances, I'm worried about the finances of everyday Americans who today are struggling in an economy that is not producing good paying jobs while everything else costs more.
0.0	1.0	I saw them come down.
0.0	0.0480769230769	We've already got a great talker in the White House.
0.0	0.642857142857	It's tax-free -- a huge advantage for our farmers and ranchers and manufacturers -- and every import pays the 16 percent business flat tax.
0.0	0.0	You know, they feel like if they don't have a lobbyist, if they're not wealthy, that somehow they don't get to play.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And yes, it was a very difficult time.
0.0	0.0480769230769	That's right.
0.0	0.0	You know, before it was called Obamacare, it was called Hillarycare.
0.0	0.0	I've tried to be as specific to answer questions so that my proposals can be vetted, because I feel like we have to level with people for the very reason, Gwen, that you are mentioning.
0.0	1.0	I voted yes to suspend that.
0.0	1.0	And as Reagan demonstrated, if we cut taxes, we can bring back growth.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And if we want to try to rebuild the coalition, as Governor Kasich was saying before, then what we better do is to get to the Arab countries that believe that ISIS is a threat, not only to them, but to us and to world peace, and bring them together.
0.0	0.0480769230769	We cannot elect somebody that doesn't know how to do the job.
0.0	0.987951807229	You've seen middle-class wages go backwards $3,700 during the Obama administration.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I believe this is still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Can we stop?
0.0	0.0	We lose on trade.
0.0	1.0	But it is a general economic issue.
0.0	0.0285714285714	And we just got to make sure that every American has the tools, in K-through-12 and in vocational education, in higher education.
0.0	1.0	They are the ones who should respond to any questions.
0.0	1.0	We should be relying upon the leadership of the Congress to pass the laws.
0.0	1.0	But we allowed people to keep health care.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And here's why.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And believe me, Assad is not worth it.
0.0	0.0	It was a company that had grown into a bloated, inept bureaucracy that cost too much and delivered too little to customers and shareholders.
0.0	0.0	Why should we let their people be sitting there smoking their cigars, sitting in their comfortable chairs in Raqqa?
0.0	0.0480769230769	So I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Let's quit making it a problem for them.
0.0	0.0	There is a radical jihadist group that is manipulating our immigration system.
0.0	0.0	I was down there, and I've never seen anything like it.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Our rights come from God.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.0480769230769	How are we going to do this?
0.0	0.0480769230769	I'll tell them that we're going to grow the economy so that we can give people better opportunities so they don't have to rely exclusively on benefit types of programs.
0.0	0.0	That's absurd, and I think people who don't want to fix it, really, or unwilling to take the chance to say, "something has to change," are missing the boat here.
0.0	0.0	...No, sir...
0.0	1.0	So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.0480769230769	The time to act is now.
0.0	0.0285714285714	If we do not know who you are, and we do not know why you are coming when I am president, you are not getting into the United States of America.
0.0	0.0	If you're not willing to do that, nobody wants to do it, but if you're not willing to gradually raise the age, you're not serious about fixing either one of them.
0.0	1.0	So it's not just the government -- the private sector companies, it's also our own government that needs to raise the level of our game.
0.0	0.0285714285714	I'll suggest a part of that was his celebrity.
0.0	1.0	No, it's your record.
0.0	0.0	And the people who are getting hammered are small businesses, it's single moms, it's Hispanics.
0.0	0.0480769230769	We need to have some coalitions in that part of the world to go after ISIS, but we also need to send a clear message.
0.0	0.0	The B-52 is still operational as the long range bomber; it was inaugurated in the age of Harry Truman.
0.0	0.0285714285714	But everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro- gay-marriage, focus around money and the media.
0.0	0.987951807229	I have a concrete plan to do just that, which allows people to keep HSAs to encourage savings, it allows for people that are retiring with Social Security to be able to get a minimum of 125 percent of the poverty level so that there is a baseline that in this generous country of ours no one goes below.
0.0	0.0	I think it's a wonderful that that businesses start a 401(k).
0.0	0.0	I went out and said, it's ridiculous.
0.0	0.0	If I am president of the United States, we're going to send soldiers back to Iraq, back to Syria, to keep us from being attacked here and keep soldiers in Afghanistan because we must.
0.0	0.0	If we're willing to do what it takes now, the 21st century is going to be the new American century, greater than any other era we've had in the history of this great nation.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Well, that just wasn't -- that just wasn't the fact, Senator.
0.0	1.0	And it's especially significant that they are working with both Turkey and Greece in order to do this.
0.0	0.0285714285714	I was on morning Joe at a town hall and a young student stood up and said, "Can I still be idealistic?"
0.0	0.0480769230769	... you're not going to have peace in Syria with Assad in charge.
0.0	0.0285714285714	Companies should, if they want to attract the best workers, provide a good set of benefits.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Thank you.
0.0	0.0480769230769	That's not right.
0.0	1.0	We need to rebuild our military, and this president has let it diminish to a point where tinpot dictators like the mullahs in Iran are taking our Navy ships.
1.0	1.0	Well, Marco has been floating this attack for a few weeks now, but the problem is, the business flat tax in my proposal is not a vat.
0.0	0.0480769230769	This is about more than replacing a D with an R. We need a leader who will help us take our government back.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And I would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country.
0.0	0.0	They're off to China.
0.0	0.0480769230769	So we have work to do.
0.0	1.0	We need to begin by undoing -- I would begin by undoing a whole set of things that President Obama has done, whether it's illegal amnesty or this latest round of EPA regulations.
0.0	0.0	But I know who the pessimist is.
1.0	1.0	You used to support a 500 percent increase in the number of guest workers, now you say that you're against it.
0.0	1.0	Last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee.
0.0	0.0	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the free enterprise system.
0.0	1.0	This president allows lawlessness throughout this country.
0.0	1.0	What are the rules on who gets to follow up.
0.0	0.0	Here is the one thing I'm not going to do.
0.0	0.0	This is a group of people that enslaves women and sells them, sells them as brides.
0.0	0.0	...in the world for people...
0.0	0.0	There have been more than 4,000 changes to the tax plan since 2001 alone.
0.0	0.0480769230769	But...
0.0	0.0	You also have to get rid of all the deductions and all the loopholes.
0.0	0.0480769230769	If you make your president, I'm going to put the country ahead of the party.
0.0	0.0480769230769	It could be people that are going to do great, great destruction.
0.0	0.642857142857	And it costs, with dynamic scoring, less than a trillion dollars.
1.0	1.0	He has called him a disappointment.
0.0	0.0	Why aren't we talking about -- instead of cutting benefits for old people, cutting benefits for sick people -- why don't we say, "let's cure the four big cost-driving diseases...
0.0	1.0	A person who, in fact, has a long experience in foreign-policy issues, which is different from many of the other governors and prospective governors who are running.
0.0	1.0	It increases the per child tax credit, because I didn't read about this in a book.
0.0	0.0285714285714	You see, because if you really want to get to a balanced budget, you need to reduce your expenses and you need to grow your economy.
0.0	0.0285714285714	And that's why I've offered a specific program to the people of America tonight to address the fundamental problem of getting our country growing again, getting our economy growing, wages up, opportunities for people.
0.0	0.0480769230769	If you want someone who's not going to divide Washington, but gets things done, then you should make me your president.
0.0	0.0285714285714	We would still have sexism preventing women from getting equal pay.
0.0	1.0	That's a dictatorship.
0.0	1.0	And recognizing that it's so important, this election, because we're talking about America for the people versus America for the government.
0.0	0.0	While there are lots of good ideas for reform, we have never tackled the basics.
0.0	0.0	I have been a strong ally with him on virtually every issue.
0.0	0.0480769230769	No.
0.0	0.0	Everybody on this stage is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	1.0	Watching this broadcast tonight are millions of people that are living paycheck to paycheck.
0.0	0.0	... no, you already had your chance, Marco, and you blew it.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.987951807229	When you have three out of the four largest financial institutions in this country bigger today than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have six financial institutions having assets equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of America, while issuing two-thirds of the credit cards and a third of the mortgages, look, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, that great trust-buster would have said break them up.
0.0	1.0	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.0	Every penny we needed from -- every penny we got from Social Security, because my sister was a minor, we needed.
0.0	0.0	The rate -- the rate -- the rate is gonna be much closer to 15 percent.
0.0	0.0480769230769	We need to stop that.
0.0	0.0	I think the American people are look for real leadership.
0.0	0.0	I know every one.
0.0	1.0	They're devaluing their currency and they're killing our companies.
0.0	1.0	As a result, eight credit upgrades; as a result, a top ten state for private sector job creation.
0.0	0.0480769230769	But somehow for decades, nothing really has changed.
0.0	0.0480769230769	There have been some good recommendations about what needs to happen.
0.0	1.0	The Egyptians have asked us to share intelligence.
0.0	0.0480769230769	But furthermore, what we have got to do, I'm sorry, yes, I do believe that we have got to do everything that we can, and it will not happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.0	Bottom line is a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people, if Congress doesn't do the right thing, we use the executive orders of the president.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And it's available on paperback, if you're interested in buying my book.
0.0	0.0285714285714	Results count, and as governor, I pushed Florida up to the top in terms of jobs, income and small business growth.
0.0	1.0	He was on the board.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I -- I've been for pausing on admitting the Syrian refugees.
1.0	1.0	I'll tell you what else they're upset about: you're 50 or 51 years old, and some kid walks in and tells you you're out of work, and you don't know where to go and where to turn.
0.0	1.0	There are many lawyers.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Jeb Bush says we've got to be willing to lose the primary in order to win the general.
0.0	0.0480769230769	When people ask me, whose fault is it?
1.0	0.987951807229	We're sitting up here talking about all these other things; 71 percent of federal spending today is on entitlements, and debt service.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Nobody can deny them.
1.0	1.0	One out of five Americans can't even afford the prescriptions their doctors are writing.
0.0	1.0	QUICK: Governor, thank you.
0.0	0.0480769230769	We hear all this discussion about well, I would do this, or I would do that, when the fact is, the border is still porous.
0.0	0.0480769230769	It has to be dealt with.
0.0	0.0	America's at a crossroads.
0.0	0.0480769230769	We need somebody who can lead.
0.0	0.987951807229	Americans are looking for somebody that's going to give them, and there is a place in this country over the last eight years in particular that talked about hope every day, and they didn't just talk about it, they delivered it.
0.0	0.987951807229	I'm saying, absolutely, we don't have to continue to lose 505 billion dollars as a trade deficit for the privilege of dealing with China.
0.0	1.0	But the best way to close this gap is to modernize higher education so Americans have the skills for those jobs.
0.0	0.987951807229	I've seen so much of it - a Soviet Union, the coming down of a wall, the issues that we saw around the world in Central America, the potential spread of communism, and 9/11 and Gulf War.
0.0	1.0	And as a result of that, the shah of Iran came in, terrible dictator.
0.0	1.0	My heart has not changed, because I've always been appalled by abortion.
0.0	1.0	So listen, this is the difference between being a governor and a senator.
0.0	0.0	Crony capitalism is what happens when government gets so big and so powerful that only the big and the powerful can handle it.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Well first of all, the idea that somehow we're better off today than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated president of the United States is totally an alternative universe.
0.0	0.0	You did support a U.N. Security Council approach, which we did follow up on.
0.0	0.0480769230769	...
0.0	1.0	He's an S corporation.
0.0	1.0	I've also called for the end of family detention, for the end of privately-run detention centers, along with private prisons, which I think are really against the common good and the rule of law.
0.0	0.0480769230769	The fact that it's happened for so many people here throughout our history, that's what makes us special.
0.0	0.0	And Mr. Trump is very focused...
0.0	0.0	None of these instances that the president points to as the reason why he's doing these things would have been preventive.
0.0	0.0480769230769	But look...
0.0	1.0	We're going to have people come in, but they're coming in legally.
0.0	0.0	(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
0.0	0.987951807229	And in terms of seniors, there are millions of seniors -- and I've talked to them in my state of Vermont and all over this country -- who are trying to get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year Social Security.
0.0	0.0	It's not responsible.
0.0	0.0	But honestly, if you're a small business owner today you are being crushed.
0.0	1.0	And specifically, we know that we could have detected and repelled some of these cyber attacks if that collaboration had been permitted.
0.0	0.0	This is the first priority.
0.0	0.0	We put in place mandatory work fair (ph).
0.0	0.0	But the poll numbers have.
0.0	1.0	Yeah, they are unhinged.
0.0	0.0	The questions that are being asked shouldn't be trying to get people to tear into each other.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Thank you.
0.0	1.0	And I have set forth a compact that would do just that for debt-free tuition.
0.0	0.0285714285714	So I'm going to keep making that case.
0.0	0.0480769230769	That's essentially what we have now, and we don't need that.
0.0	0.0	Somebody who is very fond of the president, agrees with him most of the time, I disagree with his recent deportation policies.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.0480769230769	There's -- look, there's --
0.0	0.0	I will spend every ounce of energy to stop it.
0.0	1.0	I've heard a lot of hot rhetoric here tonight, but I've got to tell you, as somebody that actually passed a budget; that paid down a half-a-trillion dollars of our national debt, you can't do it alone.
0.0	0.0480769230769	But I think a pause on Syrian refugees has been exactly right for all the governors that have called for it, and also, of course, for me as the governor of Ohio.
0.0	0.0	I guess just for the fun of it; they want to throw money around.
0.0	0.0	And that's how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America.
0.0	1.0	In my own state, for example, we launched an investigation, asked the FBI to cooperate.
0.0	1.0	But the president leads in this regard.
0.0	1.0	Mine is unique in the sense that my tax plan actually gets rid of the payroll tax as well.
0.0	1.0	You have to ban the people who are trying to hurt us.
0.0	1.0	If you look at the numbers, there are actually as many, if not more white communities that are truly being left behind and left out.
1.0	1.0	Mossadegh back in 1953.
0.0	0.0	She was a great CEO.
0.0	1.0	There is no money, it's a stack of paper.
0.0	1.0	Look, under President Obama and Secretary Clinton, they're working hard to change the American dream into the European nightmare.
0.0	0.0480769230769	We're going to fight it as hard as we can, and we're going to fight whoever the Republicans nominate who will depend on the Koch Brothers, and others.
0.0	0.987951807229	And that's the reason that I've said under my presidency, we'll create jobs and make American the number one manufacturing country in the world.
0.0	0.0	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And what distributes goods better?
0.0	0.0	I've got a very simple strategy as your president against ISIL.
0.0	0.0480769230769	We haven't done so.
0.0	0.0285714285714	Well, you know what I'm worried about?
0.0	0.0	You know, whatever your issue, your cause, the festering problem you hoped would resolved, the political class has failed you.
0.0	1.0	And that is what's so critical for our neighborhoods, our families, our children, and our grandchildren.
0.0	0.0480769230769	There are a lot of training programs and education programs that I think can be streamlined and put into a much better format so that if we do continue them they can be more useful, in public schools, community colleges, and colleges and universities.
0.0	0.0	... stirs up the demagoguery against American Muslims, that hurts us at home.
0.0	0.0	Liberty thrives when government is small.
0.0	0.0	Well, Gwen and Judy, thank you very much for hosting this event.
0.0	1.0	You know how many votes John McCain missed when he was carrying out that furious comeback that you're now modeling after?
0.0	0.0285714285714	And we rebuilt downtown Manhattan, and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved New York and loved New Yorkers.
0.0	0.0480769230769	They don't believe in building walls and a pessimistic view of the future.
0.0	0.0480769230769	You can't grow your way out of demographics.
0.0	0.0	And that's what I'll offer to the people of the United States in this candidacy for the presidency.
0.0	0.0	And, they're always going to say, "Well, we're going to fix this one day."
0.0	0.0480769230769	And what I have said is I will not throw us further into debt.
0.0	0.0480769230769	So yeah, someone who makes more money...
0.0	0.0	I've said I'm looking at a couple of different ways, one which you mentioned, Senator, but also trying to expand the existing tax to passive income that wealthy people have so that we do get more revenue into the Social Security Trust Fund.
0.0	1.0	The deployments are too high for the military personnel.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, because I've been a leader on these issues.
0.0	0.0	But you know what?
0.0	0.0	So I have voiced criticisms.
0.0	1.0	And that's what I intend to do.
0.0	1.0	Today, I'm 60, I'm not married, I don't have any kids.
0.0	0.0	We have to shut down their internet capability.
0.0	0.0	Government trying to level the playing field between Internet and brick-and-mortar creates a problem.
1.0	1.0	I have long supported the proposition that we should lift the cap on taxable income coming into the Social Security Trust Fund, starting at $250,000.
1.0	1.0	But more importantly, in terms of this Libya resolution that you have noted before, this was a virtually unanimous consent.
0.0	0.0480769230769	We need to be on the side that keeps Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.0285714285714	We're not -- the American people -- forget about anything else, they've already been lied to and stolen from.
0.0	0.0	Because criminals don't buy their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.0	ON the other side, you have so many Republicans, and what do they care about?
0.0	0.0480769230769	We need to be focusing on what fixes this country.
0.0	1.0	Over the last few weeks, I've listened to Jeb as he walked around the country and said that you're modeling your campaign after John McCain, that you're going to launch a furious comeback the way he did, by fighting hard in New Hampshire and places like that, carrying your own bag at the airport.
0.0	1.0	That is why there is massive despair all over this country.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And we will be strong again.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And right now, I will be putting up a tremendous -- so far, I've put up less than anybody and I have the best results.
0.0	0.0480769230769	So you know what needs to happen, it's a very simple equation, and it's going to happen when I'm president.
0.0	0.987951807229	I can tell you, after spending seven years as a former federal prosecutor, right after 9/11, dealing with this issue.
0.0	0.0	But, here is a pledge I've made throughout this campaign, and it's really not a very radical pledge.
0.0	0.0	I do believe that in the year 2016 we have to look in terms of public education as colleges as part of public education making public colleges and universities tuition free.
0.0	1.0	Take it from your professors...
0.0	0.0	But she did say there was anger.
0.0	1.0	I've got five grandkids.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And second, the international crisis we are facing is most dreadful and most dangerous.
0.0	0.0480769230769	For once, let's do that, and stop trying to give them some kind of fantasy that's never going to come true.
0.0	0.0	And, if this government doesn't pay it, than tell me what's different between the government and Bernie Madolf, who sits in prison today for doing less than what the government has done to the people on social security and Medicare in this country.
0.0	0.0480769230769	We're going to make a really dynamic economy from what we have right now, which is not at all dynamic.
0.0	0.0	Maria, Neil, thank you for a great debate tonight.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And it's important that people really look hard at what the threats and dangers we face are, and who is best prepared for dealing with them.
0.0	0.0	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	1.0	And -- and -- and the last piece of this, Maria, is this.
0.0	0.0	That we do all that we can to create a world of peace and prosperity.
0.0	0.0	Since he brought me up, do I not get to respond?
0.0	0.0	And then the Government steps in to try and solve the problem and we get a little further down to that progressive vision that Hillary Clinton is talking about.
0.0	0.987951807229	We have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9/11, and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks, yet we see the terrible attack in San Bernardino and know that we haven't done enough.
0.0	0.0	You know, I think most people know exactly what New York values are.
0.0	0.0	At the end of the day, the legal issue is quite straightforward, but I would note that the birther theories that Donald has been relying on -- some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on U.S. soil, but have two parents born on U.S. soil.
0.0	0.987951807229	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.0	And the way we've done it properly through regulatory action, not buy signing unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.0285714285714	When you're a governor, you're held accountable for everything you do.
0.0	0.0285714285714	Guaranteeing that women's work finally gets the pay, the equal pay that we deserve.
0.0	1.0	You have to deal with entitlements, you have to be in a position to control discretionary spending.
0.0	0.0480769230769	But if we elect the right person -- if you elect me -- we will turn this country around, we will reclaim the American dream and this nation will be stronger and greater than it has ever been.
0.0	0.0	You know, I see a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist.
0.0	0.0	And that's just not acceptable.
0.0	0.0	A flat tax for everybody -- no exemptions, no deductions, no shelters, because some people have a better capability of taking advantage of those than others.
0.0	0.0	And that's what you'll hear from Hillary Clinton -- and I've already heard from her -- is that, send more money in Social Security, send more money in Medicare taxes, send more money for Medicaid, and that's gonna solve the problem.
0.0	0.0	And clearly, what we need to do is get a group of experts together, including people from other countries, some of our friends from Israel, who have had experience screening these people and come up with new guidelines for immigration, and for visas, for people who are coming into this country.
0.0	0.0	I get to respond, right?
0.0	0.0480769230769	Thank you all very much.
0.0	0.0480769230769	That will never happen when I am president of the United States.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I think that's a mistake.
0.0	0.0	It took -- it took an arm and a leg to be able to set up a 401(k).
0.0	0.0285714285714	And by those standards, we're not doing particularly well.
0.0	1.0	I think to be commander in chief in the 21st century requires someone who understands how the economy works, someone who understands how the world works and who's in it; I know more world leaders on the stage today than anyone running, with the possible exception of Hillary Clinton; understands bureaucracies, how to cut them down to size and hold them accountable; and understands technology, which is a tool, but it's also a weapon that's being used against us.
0.0	1.0	You're looking at the -- at the man who introduced and fought on the floor as a freshman senator and passed the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 over two President Clinton vetoes.
0.0	1.0	Do we have answer for that?
0.0	0.0	OK?
0.0	1.0	They don't provide any abortions in Louisiana.
0.0	1.0	I'm going to do it for America.
0.0	0.0285714285714	We need to make sure that we keep the country safe.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And that is wrong.
0.0	1.0	And this deal is giving him a pathway to a bomb, a missile to deliver it, and money to pay for it all.
0.0	0.0	Well, if that's the case, we're going to win every state, if Bernie Sanders is the nominee.
0.0	0.0480769230769	That's was hard work.
0.0	0.0	How can we beat an enemy if our commander-in-chief doesn't have the moral honesty and clarity to say that Islam has a problem, and that problem is radical Islam, to say they've got to condemn not generic acts of violence, but the individual murderers who are committing these acts of violence.
0.0	0.0	For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses closing than starting.
0.0	0.0285714285714	And I will go back to Washington with my plan.
0.0	0.0	I don't think you expand entitlements when so many people are dependent on government and when the money the federal government is offering is going to be taken away from you after just a couple of years.
0.0	0.0	When you head back to airport tonight, go check and see what the...
0.0	1.0	On day one in the Oval Office, I would make two phone calls.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Too often, they give up, they negotiate with themselves.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Probably in terms of the applying for the job of president, a weakness would be not really seeing myself in that position until hundreds of thousands of people began to tell me that I needed to do it.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I said, absolutely, you can still change the world.
0.0	0.0480769230769	This country is changing.
0.0	0.0480769230769	We put in place child care support.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I think America is just a few good decisions and a leadership change at the top away from the best years we've ever had.
0.0	0.0480769230769	It was the AFL-CIO.
0.0	1.0	We could overthrow Assad tomorrow if we wanted to.
1.0	0.0	It allows President Obama to borrow unlimited amounts of money.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I think he is right.
0.0	0.0480769230769	We need a unifier, not a cynical divider in chief, and that's exactly what I will do.
1.0	1.0	He wrote a forward for a book that basically argued voters should have buyers' remorse when it comes to President Obama's leadership and legacy.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I would take the fight to these guys, whatever it took, as long as it took.
0.0	1.0	The American people are never going to trust Washington, D.C., and for good reason.
0.0	0.0	Today a male African-American baby born today stands a one-in-four chance of ending up in jail.
1.0	1.0	In the past he has called him weak.
0.0	1.0	You know, I have two sons.
0.0	0.0285714285714	Well, first off, let's face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	1.0	... his answer -- you name it.
0.0	0.0480769230769	... the fact is, Neil, let's think about -- let's think about -- and I want to maybe -- I hope the president is watching tonight, because here's what I'd like to tell him.
0.0	0.0	But I want to go further.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Let me, you know, again, respectfully disagree with Secretary Clinton here.
0.0	0.0	I've had my issues with Donald Trump.
0.0	0.0285714285714	We can do a wall.
0.0	1.0	And they don't buy their guns from a gun store.
0.0	1.0	And if you really want to believe that you can get your voice back, I will tell you, as I have all my career, I will continue to fight for you, because you're the ones that built this country, and will carry it into the future.
0.0	1.0	But bottom line is: The president is right.
0.0	0.0	I believe in government, but I believe in efficient government, not wasteful government.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Well, let me tell you this.
0.0	1.0	But to destroy ISIS, it is necessary.
0.0	0.0480769230769	They haven't done that.
0.0	0.987951807229	So the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced: a simple flat tax, 10 percent for individuals, and a 16 percent business flat tax, you abolish the IRS...
0.0	1.0	... and as president, I'm going to fight for the working men and women.
0.0	1.0	This is not some small scale group.
0.0	1.0	And now they see Hillary Clinton proposing a third term of economic policy for our country.
0.0	0.0480769230769	If you do that, you don't just change the economy, you transform the lives of millions of hurting Americans.
0.0	1.0	Here is where we are with public education.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Well, I'm just not sure I agree completely with that assessment.
0.0	0.0	I was a person who has dealt extensively with these homeland security issues.
0.0	0.987951807229	Businesses will now have to pay 16 percent on the money they make.
0.0	0.0	You know, I completely agree with Senator Sanders.
0.0	1.0	So what we do, though, is, if there is somebody who is price- gouging, we have laws for prosecutors to take that on.
0.0	1.0	And she is just one or two more poll drops down from even moving further left than she's moved already to get to the left of Bernie on this.
0.0	0.0	But you know what, you can make a middle class wage, you have decent health care, decent benefits.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And, yes, people we may disagree with on a number of things may have some insight, may have some relationships that are important for the president to understand in order to best protect the United States.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Well, there's no question that ISIS is a very serious problem, and I don't believe that this administration recognizes how serious it is.
0.0	0.987951807229	Any connection to the fact that not one Republican candidate for president thinks and agrees with the scientific community that climate change is real and that we have got to transform our energy system?
0.0	1.0	We just, earlier this week, kicked them out of Medicaid in Louisiana as well, canceled their provider contract.
0.0	0.987951807229	I have the opportunity not just to run, but to win in the deep blue state of New York three times.
0.0	0.987951807229	The issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24 months ago.
0.0	0.0	Unfortunately, Governor Christie has endorsed many of the ideas that Barack Obama supports, whether it is Common Core or gun control or the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor or the donation he made to Planned Parenthood.
1.0	1.0	And the reason I said that is because the FBI director told the American people, told Congress, that he could not guarantee he could vet them and it would be safe.
0.0	1.0	Can I just add one very quick thing?
0.0	0.642857142857	... of $50 billion...
0.0	0.0480769230769	We should be deporting criminals, not hardworking immigrant families who do the very best they can and often are keeping economies going in many places in our country.
0.0	0.0480769230769	The president doesn't understand -- and by the way, neither does Secretary Clinton -- and here's my warning to everybody out in the audience tonight.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Right.
0.0	0.0480769230769	What we need to do is destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.0	There's no way he launches 11 attack --
0.0	0.0480769230769	No.
0.0	0.0480769230769	So that is not by any stretch a pie in the sky.
0.0	0.0	Senator Cruz is precisely right.
0.0	0.0480769230769	But I think they will see a very good option here.
0.0	0.0	One thing I want to be clear about tonight.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Well, a couple of things.
0.0	0.0	Almost every hotel in Atlantic City has either been in bankruptcy or will be in bankruptcy -- the biggest.
0.0	0.0480769230769	The fact of the matter is he doesn't realize that we now live in the 21st century, and that war is very different than it used to be before.
0.0	0.0285714285714	Secretary Clinton has been going around the country saying Bernie Sanders wants to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, people are going to lose their MedicAid, they're going to lose their CHIP program.
0.0	0.0480769230769	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.0	That's not why I ran for office.
0.0	1.0	And what is that proposal?
0.0	0.0	You know, you look at what's going on, you see all the divisiveness and the hatred that goes on in our society.
0.0	0.0	Well, first of all, let's understand why we are even having this debate and why Donald tapped in to some of that anger that's out there about this whole issue.
0.0	1.0	Let me concur with the secretary, no question women's rights are under fierce attack all over this country.
0.0	0.0	If I have a weakness, it's that I try to live by the rules.
0.0	0.0	And I'm glad that I have a chance to answer this question.
0.0	0.0	It's good to be with you.
0.0	0.0	If I'm the nominee, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	1.0	All over this country we have Republican candidates for president saying we hate the government.
0.0	0.0480769230769	He's wrong.
0.0	1.0	In all due respect, Secretary Clinton, a lot of the progressive groups, the online groups have really asked you a simple question.
0.0	1.0	What we are talking about in reality is a corrupt campaign finance system, that's what we're talking about.
0.0	0.0480769230769	It never happens.
0.0	0.0480769230769	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.987951807229	Fred Thompson was the other one, a man who had spent a lot of time on that screen.
0.0	0.0	They're sick of politics as usual.
0.0	0.0	He just writes out an order, executive order.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I think it's a good product.
0.0	0.0	And, let me now on Social Security because we were getting into a good substantive exchange, and I want to say I think both Chris, and Mike are right.
0.0	0.0480769230769	It was a hard choice.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Say again?
0.0	1.0	Today, we have a legal immigration system for permanent residency that is largely based on whether or not you have a relative living here.
0.0	0.0	I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would.
0.0	0.0480769230769	The fact is, the reason why...
0.0	0.0480769230769	That's what I'm working towards.
0.0	0.0	And women have been disadvantaged ever since.
0.0	0.642857142857	Our wages are growing faster than the national average, and I've cut taxes more than any sitting governor in this state -- $5 billion, including no taxes on small business and killing the death tax.
0.0	0.0480769230769	If we don't stop them over there, they are coming here just as sure as I stand here in front of you.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I've learned from him that what we need to achieve is peace through strength, which means we need to rebuild the military.
0.0	0.0480769230769	This election has to be about reversing all of that damage.
0.0	1.0	So, also, we can stimulate the economy.
0.0	0.0	In my family, my dad fled oppression in Cuba to come to America.
0.0	0.642857142857	We have a budget closer to $3.5 trillion.
0.0	0.0	I also believe that marriage is between one man and one woman.
0.0	1.0	Back in 2004, one of my predecessors to the Senate by the name of Bob Graham, a Democrat, ran for president missing over 30 percent of his votes.
0.0	1.0	We need to be very well aware of the fact that China and Russia are using technology to attack us, just as ISIS is using technology to recruit those who would murder American citizens.
0.0	0.0	And I say that to Nikki.
0.0	0.0480769230769	These...
0.0	0.0	And we need to do that throughout the country.
0.0	0.0	And he was a managing general partner.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Now that he is, he's changed his tune.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I would begin by saying that I'm not sure it's a weakness, but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for America's future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people.
0.0	0.987951807229	So when you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration -- which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother -- clearly, we are looking at institutional racism.
0.0	0.0	I ask for your support to build, together, a safer and stronger America.
0.0	0.0480769230769	So I'm going to come up with the best way forward.
0.0	1.0	... an agreement with the...
0.0	1.0	If you take donations from Wall Street, you can't be independent.
0.0	0.0285714285714	That is the appropriate approach in order to get the results that you are seeking.
0.0	0.0	Big and powerful use big and powerful government to their advantage.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I'm a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	1.0	One of them is a statewide use of deadly force.
0.0	0.0480769230769	What I believe is the United States, in fact, should join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee healthcare to all people.
0.0	1.0	And that's why Ronald Reagan said that it was a blindfold.
0.0	0.0	We have talked about tax reform in every single election for decades.
0.0	0.0480769230769	It's like them getting mugged, and then us saying, well, we're going to mug you some more.
0.0	1.0	And you combine that with reforms of our welfare system.
0.0	1.0	See, in Ohio, we've had some controversial decisions.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I'm going to prioritize those recipients who need the most help first.
0.0	0.0	We can reform those entitlements, we can change that corporate tax code and lower it.
0.0	0.0	We bailed them out.
0.0	1.0	2016 is going to be a fight between conservatism, and a Democrat party that is undermining the very character of this nation.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I think they made the Second Amendment the second amendment because they thought it was just that important.
0.0	0.0480769230769	That's why I've been leading the fight to stop it.
0.0	1.0	The the truth of the matter is, big government benefits the wealthy, it benefits the lobbyists, it benefits the giant corporations.
0.0	0.0480769230769	He's penalized -- and doesn't understand.
0.0	1.0	They're a scam.
0.0	1.0	They understand that there's a national security risk.
0.0	1.0	We don't need Hillary Clinton's price controls for -- again, does anybody out there think that giving Washington, D.C., the opportunity to run the pharmaceutical industry is a good idea, given how well they have done running the government?
0.0	0.0	And it is a -- the kind of criticism that we've heard from Senator Sanders about our president I expect from Republicans.
0.0	1.0	But I would add this.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Because the damage he has done to America is extraordinary.
0.0	0.0	You have to lead.
0.0	0.987951807229	CLINTON: Judy, I think that the best analysis that I've seen based on Senator Sanders plans is that it would probably increase the size of the federal government by about 40%, but what is most concerning to me is that in looking at the plans -- let's take healthcare for example.
0.0	0.0480769230769	The fact is that there was a great effort made by the Obama administration and others to really send a clear message, because we knew that so many of these children were being abused, being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border.
0.0	0.0480769230769	We are all frustrated with what China is doing.
0.0	0.0	Marco leaves the IRS code in with all of the complexity.
0.0	1.0	I will do that in Washington.
0.0	0.0	And in your heart of hearts, you cannot wait to see a debate between Hillary Clinton and Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I know some people like to say, "well, this is free money."
0.0	0.0	Edward Snowden is a traitor.
0.0	1.0	And God only knows Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator.
0.0	0.0480769230769	We don't need that.
0.0	0.0480769230769	He is the party's frontrunner right now, and good for him.
0.0	1.0	You'll see me on the floor of the Senate tomorrow filibustering this and saying enough is enough, no more debt.
0.0	0.0480769230769	You know, I have said -- I have said many times, you know, I'm not asking people to support me because I'm a woman.
0.0	1.0	And one more point, one more point.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Thirdly, we need to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to send a serious signal that we're back in the game with Israel --
0.0	0.0480769230769	I can.
0.0	0.642857142857	We're borrowing a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.0480769230769	The truth is I had to make some tough calls in some tough times.
0.0	1.0	We know (ph) to go ahead and shut off the supply routes, and send in our special ops at 2:00 a.m. and attack them everywhere they go.
0.0	1.0	I have seen him appoint people to our courts not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.0480769230769	So, let's stop fooling around about this, let's tell people the truth.
0.0	0.0	... and I'll tell you why.
0.0	1.0	I would choose Nelson Mandela for his generosity of heart, his understanding of the need for reconciliation.
0.0	1.0	My 750,000 donors have contributed more than a million and a half donations.
0.0	1.0	I'm worried about bankrupting the American people.
0.0	0.0	That could be the great Trojan Horse.
0.0	0.0480769230769	China and Russia have never been on our side of the table.
0.0	1.0	You know, you had Herbert Hoover before that saying, no, we got to only worry about the deficit.
0.0	0.0480769230769	But a great nation like ours should not be in a position where elderly people are cutting their pills in half, where they don't have decent nutrition, where they can't heat their homes in the wintertime.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And I believe people need a leader who is prepared to make tough calls in tough times and stand up...
0.0	0.0	Here's my promise, at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country.
0.0	0.0	Let me tell you what I would do immediately, day two in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And if you can't use the term, you're never going to solve the problem.
0.0	0.0480769230769	In my administration, we will help to make sure we bring people together in the Middle East, and we will fight ISIS and defeat them.
0.0	0.0	But also, I can't fake anger.
0.0	0.0480769230769	OK, just so you understand -- I know so much about trading about with China.
0.0	0.0480769230769	It's not fair trade.
0.0	1.0	According to the FBI and the director of national intelligence, Syria's becoming a perfect platform to strike our nation.
0.0	0.0	We both have a lot of small donors.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And...
0.0	0.987951807229	My mom who's here today, was a single mom when my father left us when I was 3 years old.
0.0	1.0	He's a major Hillary Clinton supporter.
0.0	0.0285714285714	We have to stand with them.
0.0	0.0480769230769	CRUZL But I will say --
0.0	0.0	Because we work with the private sector to make solar energy affordable and available to businesses and individuals in our state.
0.0	0.0	I've spent a lifetime in politics fighting the Clinton machine.
0.0	0.0	And they will work with me to get comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.0	I understand.
0.0	0.0	And there's a reason why Hillary's supporters are echoing Donald's attacks on me, because Hillary...
0.0	1.0	I far prefer that and the chances we have to be successful there than trying to start all over again, gridlocking our system, and trying to get from zero to 100 percent.
0.0	0.0480769230769	You do.
0.0	1.0	And what I think all of us are saying is, our monetary policy, our tax policy, regulatory policy needs to be radically changed so we can create high sustained growth for income to rise.
0.0	0.0	You're right.
0.0	0.0285714285714	They are -- they're in a position where they're smothering people.
0.0	0.0285714285714	Last week, Secretary Carter announced that the Navy's going to be cut again.
0.0	0.0285714285714	Obamacare, we're going to repeal it and replace it.
0.0	1.0	You looking at me?
0.0	0.0	Never been done before, never been done since.
1.0	1.0	And what that's led to over $2 trillion of American companies' monies that are being kept offshore, because they don't want to pay the second tax.
0.0	0.0	And I'm not blaming these folks -- well, I guess I could.
0.0	0.0480769230769	The way to take that away from them is to talk to our military officials and ask them, "what do you need in order to accomplish this goal?"
0.0	0.0	I was the architect.
0.0	0.0	Yes.
0.0	0.0	Are you serious about this election?
0.0	0.0480769230769	We need to have stronger families.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And if you become the nominee, who the hell knows if you can even serve in office?
0.0	0.0	We have to shut down, whether or not they're in prisons preaching or on -- in mosques preaching.
0.0	1.0	In fact, it's the chief argument by democrats against many of the different flat tax proposals.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Young people for whom getting involved in politics is as, you know, it's like going to the moon.
0.0	0.0	In all due respect...
0.0	1.0	Credibility counts.
0.0	0.987951807229	He used chemical weapons, he's killed, now, over a quarter of a million of his own people, and this president has done nothing.
0.0	1.0	Let me (inaudible).
0.0	0.0	But what happens if, God forbid, the next Barack Obama takes over, and the next Nancy Pelosi, and the next Harry Reid...
0.0	0.0480769230769	You know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Somebody who, yes, votes right, but much more than that, leads the efforts to protect the hard-fought gains that women have made, that, make no mistake about it, are under tremendous attack, not just by the Republican presidential candidates but by a whole national effort to try to set back women's rights.
0.0	0.987951807229	The Republican Party is blessed to have 11 good candidates, (inaudible) 10 good candidates.
0.0	0.0480769230769	That was before he was running against me.
0.0	1.0	I win.
0.0	0.0	The government has tried it their way.
0.0	0.0480769230769	That will change everything.
0.0	1.0	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.0480769230769	We need sound money.
0.0	0.0	Of course you are right.
0.0	0.0	Well, when you look at the celebrity of Donald Trump, then I think that says a lot about it.
0.0	1.0	I ran for office to make the generational changes in Louisiana.
0.0	0.0480769230769	This president has gone to Congress and said give me a three-year deadline, give me a ban on ground troops.
1.0	0.0	I was not at all critical of him.
0.0	0.0	I'm the only guy on this stage -- you know, everybody has an "only guy" -- "I'm the only guy this; I'm the only guy that."
0.0	0.0	And the reason is simple: because in 2008, we elected as president someone who wasn't interested in fixing America.
0.0	0.0	But if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in Flint.
0.0	1.0	I strongly support the president's executive actions.
0.0	0.987951807229	If she gets elected, her first 100 days, instead of setting an agenda, she might be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse.
0.0	1.0	But the greatest gains, percentage-wise, for people, are gonna be at the lower end of our plan, and here's why: because in addition to a general personal exemption, we are increasing the per-child tax credit for working families.
0.0	0.0	John, I'll tell you something.
0.0	0.0	But that's not an accurate description of the plan.
0.0	0.0480769230769	In my view, it doesn't go anywhere near far enough.
0.0	0.0480769230769	So I know Secretary Kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease-fire up as quickly as possible.
0.0	0.0	The planes are older than the pilots.
0.0	0.0480769230769	This president has failed, and when I'm in the Oval Office, police officers will know that they will have the support of the president of the Untied States.
1.0	1.0	As I understand it, the African-American community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse.
0.0	0.0	Today, many of us picked up our newspapers, and we were horrified to see the sight of 10 American sailors on their knees, with their hands on their heads.
0.0	1.0	And by the way, it's not just on immigration, you used to support TPA, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.0	...The other thing I'd like to make about our plan, one more point, it is the most pro growth tax plan that I can imagine because it doesn't tax investments at all.
0.0	0.0	You know that.
0.0	1.0	It's the only way you fix Medicare, the only way you fix Social Security.
0.0	0.0	Neil, Neil -- can I say one thing about this.
0.0	0.0	I'm ready.
0.0	1.0	So the answer is no and what Jeb said is absolutely correct.
0.0	0.0480769230769	It is a unique nation in all of human history and on the face of the planet, because here, our founders believed that everyone has a right to fulfill their potential and that that right --they called it life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness -- comes from God and cannot be taken away by government.
0.0	0.0285714285714	You've got to keep asking.
0.0	0.0480769230769	The other Arab countries have a role to play in this.
0.0	0.0	And then in addition to that, the American people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.0285714285714	Now in terms of their really stunning hit piece, what they mentioned is when I was running for senate -- unlike Hillary Clinton, I don't have masses of money in the bank, hundreds of millions of dollars.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Because now he's going a little bit better.
0.0	0.0	Before this, I was a very successful person as a developer and as a businessman.
0.0	0.0	You find me...
0.0	0.0	Actually, I'd love to get you to build a wall.
0.0	1.0	She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video.
0.0	0.0	It needs to be repealed and replaced.
0.0	0.0	I lead the opposition against it.
0.0	0.0480769230769	You can't do nothing.
0.0	0.0480769230769	It's a private-sector solution that believes in freedom, not Obamacare that believes in government control.
0.0	0.0	Well, first off, what we don't do is do what Hillary Clinton and John Kerry and Barack Obama want us to do, which is their solution for everything, put more taxes on it, give more money to Washington, D.C., and then they will fix it.
0.0	0.0	And that's an economy where ordinary Americans are working longer hours for low wagers.
0.0	1.0	That's wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country.
0.0	0.0	You have to ban radical Islamic jihadists.
0.0	0.0	I promise.
0.0	0.0	That expertise needs to spread all across the government and there needs to be much more cooperation with our private sector.
0.0	0.0480769230769	We're not going to solve this problem with traditional politics.
0.0	1.0	Not just the hacking of OPM, but that is -- that is just shameful.
0.0	0.0	That's not the way the game is supposed to be played.
0.0	0.0	No, the Federal Government should not play a larger role.
1.0	0.987951807229	Six million more people living in poverty than the day that Barack Obama got elected president, and the left just wants more of the same.
0.0	0.0285714285714	I'm deadly serious about doing this job the right way.
0.0	0.0480769230769	But we can give people better health care.
0.0	1.0	But for that Texas police officer, we could have had a mass murder.
0.0	0.0	And by the way, the police are the most mistreated people in this country.
0.0	0.0	And God bless America.
0.0	0.0	I have Ryan Tannehill, Marco, as my quarterback, he was 18 for 19 last week.
0.0	0.0480769230769	But on this point, if I may add something on this point.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And our economy was growing like crazy.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I can do that.
0.0	1.0	Absolutely, they should fight to fund -- defund Planned Parenthood, and I don't think the president should shut down the government simply to send our taxpayer dollars to this group.
0.0	0.0	...This is a matter not of math, this is a matter of morality.
0.0	0.0	If I become President because we'll have a Constitutional Amendment to require a federally balanced budget so they will do their job.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Just want to get that out there, just saying.
0.0	1.0	This is a humanitarian catastrophe.
0.0	0.0285714285714	And yet the man who led my firing, Tom Perkins, an icon of Silicon Valley, has come out publicly and said, "you know what?
0.0	0.0	And I can do it regardless of what the makeup of Congress is because I did it in New York state.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Well, that has not been a part of most of the proposals that I've seen.
0.0	0.0	... so you don't actually want to hear the answer, John?
0.0	1.0	So we have no disagreement about the need to buttress Social Security, get more revenue into the program.
0.0	1.0	And you put me on that stage against her next September, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And together, we can solve these problems that hurt us and heal America.
0.0	0.0	Iran sanctions -- the Iran sanctions that brought them to the table, those are sanctions that we put in place when I was in the United States Senate, and a whole host of other things that put me in a position of saying, I not only have a great vision, but I can govern effectively in Washington.
0.0	1.0	I am not a single- issue candidate, and I do not believe we live in a single-issue country.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Madam Secretary, that is a low blow.
0.0	1.0	And let's not let the secular progressives drive that out of us.
0.0	0.0480769230769	They don't want them made here.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I can tell you, there wouldn't have been much damage.
0.0	1.0	... on the issue -- on the issue of citizenship, Donald...
0.0	0.0480769230769	No.
0.0	0.0480769230769	It always seems to be the private marketplace does a better job.
0.0	0.0480769230769	If you'll answer the (inaudible) core question.
0.0	0.0	Why don't we just give a chicken in every pot, while we're, you know, coming up -- coming up with these fantasy tax schemes.
0.0	0.0	You know, when you go into the store and buy a box of laundry detergent, and the price has up -- you know, 50 cents because of regulations, a poor person notices that.
0.0	0.0	Caesar's -- excuse me -- Caesar's, the Rolls-Royce, as you know, is in bankruptcy.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I was invoked in that question, so let me just say -- in that answer -- let me say, the real question here, I hate to interrupt this episode of Court TV.
0.0	0.0	I'll talk to them.
0.0	0.0	That makes the world less peaceful, less safe.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And I would note the other individuals on this stage were nowhere to be found in that fight.
0.0	0.0	Which is what we're gonna get if we elect a big government liberal like Hillary Clinton to the White House.
1.0	1.0	Our military is a disaster.
0.0	1.0	She voted for it.
0.0	1.0	I want to go back to what we were talking about earlier, this budget deal in Washington.
0.0	0.0	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government to be setting minimum wages...
0.0	0.0480769230769	Freedom is personal for me, and I will always keep my word and fight for freedom.
0.0	0.0	How about Obamacare, a certified job killer?
0.0	0.0480769230769	And just thirdly, he was so nice.
0.0	0.0285714285714	This is about people's lives, and we should level with the American people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare.
0.0	0.0	What we know is we're living longer.
0.0	1.0	Or would you rather take less later on?
0.0	0.0	But, by the way, when it comes to a woman having to make a very personal choice, ah, in that case, my Republican colleagues love the government and want the government to make that choice for every woman in America.
0.0	0.0	You know why?
0.0	0.0480769230769	The question always is, what works better, the private marketplace or government?
0.0	0.0	Well, they're the ones not listening to the scientists today, because doctors say that at 20 weeks that is a viable life inside the womb.
0.0	1.0	And I'll tell you what Hillary Clinton has said: Hillary Clinton says she agrees with the dissenters -- the Supreme Court dissenters in the Heller case.
0.0	0.0	That is the way to deal with China at the end of the day.
0.0	0.987951807229	One of the great challenges that we have, $150 billion is fixing to go to a country that killed our Marines in Lebanon, that used their weapons to kill our young men in Iran.
0.0	0.0480769230769	So, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities.
0.0	0.0285714285714	We now have some good models about how better to provide employment, housing and education.
0.0	0.0285714285714	But you know, here's the real issue, is this America anymore?
0.0	0.0480769230769	They should be running all the time, then they won't have time to plan attacks against us.
0.0	0.0	That's how you make peace in the world.
0.0	0.0	He was overthrown by British and American interests because he threatened oil interests of the British.
0.0	0.0480769230769	We elected someone as president who wants to change America, who wants to make it more like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.0285714285714	So what I will tell you about our incentives -- our incentives are tight, and at the end of the day we make sure that we gain more from the creation of jobs than what we lose.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I do, however, believe in Reagan's 11th commandment, and will not be engaging in awful things about my compatriots here.
0.0	0.0	You see, you have one side, the Democrats, and with immigration, all they care about is votes.
0.0	1.0	And I mean, are you kidding me?
0.0	0.0480769230769	We don't have a health care crisis in America, we have a health crisis.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And in fact I would go further.
0.0	0.0	And at that point, it's a life that we have the right to protect, and I think we should protect.
0.0	0.0	Look, it takes three things basically to grow jobs.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And that doesn't have to be true.
0.0	1.0	And I used it to pay off my loans.
0.0	0.0480769230769	They believe some are smarter than others, some are better than others, so some are going to need to take care of others.
1.0	1.0	Someone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander in chief and someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi can never be president of the United States.
0.0	0.0	SuperPacs are a disaster.
0.0	0.0	I think there is constitutional and legal authority for the president to have done what he did.
0.0	0.0	Mine actually cuts the payroll tax, and I think it would spread the tax cut across all socioeconomic levels, and would allow then it to be something that would be broadly supported by the public in an election.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Thank you.
0.0	0.0285714285714	Well, it's not a matter of what the first executive order would be, Bill.
0.0	0.0	It's the people that pull the trigger and we have to find out what is going on.
0.0	0.0480769230769	So we need to get on a different mindset.
0.0	1.0	Let me translate that for you.
0.0	0.0480769230769	It was a terrible sight.
0.0	0.0480769230769	As we speak, there are new problems on the horizon.
0.0	1.0	I was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came.
0.0	1.0	And we should back up the recent donors conference to make sure we have made our contribution to try to deal with the enormous cost that these refugees are posing to Turkey and to members of the E.U.
0.0	1.0	Now, you can support one now that's very low.
0.0	1.0	That is not what America should be about.
0.0	1.0	It is time to believe in America again.
0.0	0.0285714285714	America is back in the leadership business.
0.0	1.0	The business flat tax, they already impose their taxes on us, so there's no reciprocal...
0.0	0.0480769230769	They didn't do that either.
0.0	0.0	And with respect to the 2007 bill, this was Ted Kennedy's bill.
1.0	1.0	You used to support legalizing people that were here illegally, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.987951807229	About every two weeks, he holds a press conference talking about how he can't wait to restrict people's access to guns.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Gosh, I'd love for us to talk about something like that.
0.0	1.0	But I will tell you this, Atlantic City, you're using that, hundreds of companies that I have opened have thrived.
0.0	1.0	Do I take the product?
0.0	1.0	Imagine a country where the middle class can get rising income again.
0.0	0.0480769230769	But I think it is really unfair to suggest that I have not been supportive of the president.
0.0	0.0	It's you see the health insurance companies getting together.
0.0	0.0	Let's listen to them and let's not listen to our politicians.
0.0	0.0480769230769	We have a tremendous problem.
0.0	0.0	I think that's a major accomplishment.
0.0	0.0480769230769	We honest to god are here to get this country back on track.
0.0	0.987951807229	You find a Democrat that's for cutting taxes -- cutting spending ten dollars, I'll give them a warm kiss.
0.0	0.0	Well, I don't know if it's a blind trust if Ivanka, Don and Eric run it.
0.0	0.987951807229	Now, Secretary Clinton's Super PAC, as I understand it, received $25 million dollars last reporting period, $15 million dollars from Wall Street.
0.0	0.0	It's Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.0	Finally, we'll take off the political handcuffs.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I think I'm going to win fair and square (inaudible) to win this way.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I think he would have been right.
0.0	1.0	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.0	But I guess I'm supposed to come out great.
0.0	0.0	I will change the culture in Washington, just as I changed the culture in Tallahassee.
0.0	0.0285714285714	And that's why we must make sure we continue to frack.
1.0	1.0	Becky, it is the height of hypocrisy for Mrs. Clinton to talk about being the first woman President, when every single policy she espouses, and every single policy of President Obama has been demonstrably bad for women.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And as president, I will rebuild the military and keep this country safe.
0.0	0.0480769230769	We're going to be tough at the border, we're going to be tough on all of the illegal immigrants that everybody else in this field -- we're going to be different.
0.0	0.0	The more the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected are advantaged.
0.0	1.0	I'll check for you.
0.0	0.0285714285714	Well, first of all, if a company gets caught doing that, they should never be able to use the program again.
0.0	0.0	We didn't spend any.
0.0	0.0480769230769	You know, I know to a lot of people in the media, this is just a great big game, and we're the players.
0.0	1.0	Secondly, a policy on recruiting and hiring, and then more resources for -- for training.
0.0	0.0480769230769	But if you want someone to drive you home, I will get the job done and I will get you home.
0.0	0.0480769230769	If you elect me president of the United States, I will secure that southern border.
0.0	0.987951807229	Well, first of all, we're running a $2 billion dollar surplus, we're not having a revenue problem right now.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And I think the focus ought to be on making sure that we leave this nomination process, as wild and woolly as it's going to be -- this is not being bad.
0.0	0.0480769230769	But I'm going to tell you the truth.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Here is the case, they both agree, they can't make a deal.
0.0	0.0	At the core of that resolution is an agreement I negotiated in June of 2012 in Geneva, which set forth a cease-fire and moving toward a political resolution, trying to bring the parties at stake in Syria together.
0.0	1.0	The other issue is mental health.
0.0	0.0	It's kind of basic.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I think we should be for free trade but I think fair trade.
0.0	0.0	Neil, my name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.0	Absolutely.
0.0	0.0	So, I'm proud of Senator Sanders, and his supporters.
0.0	0.0	And remember this -- I'm credible on this for this reason: Americans for Tax Reform says that I've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history.
0.0	0.0480769230769	That sounds like people are afraid the president's going to take their guns away.
0.0	0.0	On welfare.
0.0	0.0	But let's be clear: Russia's aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO -- correctly, I believe -- are saying, you know what, we're going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action.
1.0	0.987951807229	Well, the average small manufacturer, whatever they're manufacturing, drugs or anything, if they have less than 50 employees, the average cost in terms of regulations is $34,000 per employee.
0.0	0.0480769230769	That is the way we deal with global warming, climate change, or any of those problems, not through government intervention, not through government taxes, and for God's sake, don't send Washington another dime until they stop wasting the money they're already sending there.
0.0	0.0	But the facts and the law here are really quite clear.
0.0	0.0	And there's a bunch of things my tax plan does to help them.
0.0	0.987951807229	And so much of what we did -- to force competition, to use technology, to stand down the special interest groups -- can you imagine taking Medicaid from 10 to 2.5 percent?
0.0	0.0	But in 2008, we elected a president that didn't want to fix America.
0.0	0.0480769230769	It's extraordinarily wrong.
0.0	0.0	You want to talk about what we're going to be up against next year?
0.0	0.0	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.0	So look, corporations ought to exercise some responsibility.
0.0	0.0480769230769	When -- when we put all the facts down, you'll be able to see that it's not true, it works out very well.
0.0	0.0480769230769	We have Dodd-Frank.
0.0	0.0480769230769	That's how you solve the problem.
0.0	0.0	I want to take care of women.
0.0	1.0	Number one, you have people in this country that...
0.0	0.0285714285714	We need to make sure that people understand, as Jeb said before, that if you've done extraordinarily well in this country, do you want them to take more out of your taxes now and think they're gonna give it back to you later?
0.0	0.0480769230769	I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.0	Let's let a Justice Department -- and I will make an attorney general who will enforce the law and make justice more than just a word.
0.0	0.0480769230769	There's something going on and it's bad.
0.0	0.0480769230769	-- the issue is who is going to get it done.
0.0	0.0285714285714	I think he would have said bring back a 21st-century Glass-Steagall legislation.
0.0	1.0	So I'm going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of Americans fulfilling their potential, because I don't think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single American to live up to theirs.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I had to work my way through school.
0.0	1.0	And we have to take on ISIS online.
0.0	0.0	And listen, there is a real difference between Marco's tax plan and mine.
0.0	1.0	... they don't like the Wall Street Journal.
0.0	1.0	Well, let's go with three.
0.0	1.0	We sent our Texas ranger recon teams.
0.0	0.0285714285714	I've got the backbone, I've got the band width, I've got the experience to get us through this.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And -- you know, all of this too big to fail stuff and picking and choosing winners and losers -- this is a bunch of crap, and it is really causing a great deal of -- great deal of problems for our society right now.
0.0	0.987951807229	Eleven points, to be exact.
0.0	1.0	If it's Medicare for all, then you no longer have the Affordable Care Act, because the Affordable Care Act, as you know very well, is based on the insurance system, based on exchanges, based on a subsidy system.
0.0	1.0	But, I would also add this.
0.0	1.0	And I would not support those.
0.0	1.0	Here's the truth.
0.0	0.0	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
1.0	0.0	The government stole it, and spent it a long time ago...
0.0	1.0	Yesterday, the president stunningly admitted this.
0.0	0.987951807229	Every single time that there has been a Defense bill in the Senate, three people team up to vote against it.
0.0	1.0	We're going to let people in, but they're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.0	We need fundamental police reform, clearly, clearly, when we talk about a criminal justice system.
0.0	0.0285714285714	And make sure you enhance savings in the private market.
0.0	0.0	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.0	And, you look at the questions -- "Donald Trump, are you a comic-book villain?"
0.0	0.0480769230769	Yes, our allies are not perfect.
0.0	1.0	...Or, even some famous Colorado brownies.
0.0	0.987951807229	I started the Gang of Seven, and it led to the overtaking of the 40-year Democratic rule of Congress, because I didn't -- I stood up to the old-boy network in Washington, D.C. because I believed that Washington was not the solution, that Washington was the problem, just like Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.0285714285714	So, we're going to enforce the law, we're going to change policing practices, we're going to change incarceration practices, but we're also going to emphasize education, jobs, and housing.
0.0	0.0	But I was born here.
0.0	1.0	It is a constitutional right of every American to be able to protect themselves and their families.
0.0	0.0480769230769	You know, I find it really quite fascinating some of the president's proclamations.
0.0	1.0	So, we're talking about -- we're talking about reform for people like me and people like Senator Cruz, as he talked about earlier, who are years away from retirement that have a way to plan for these changes, and way that's very reasonable.
0.0	0.0480769230769	You cannot make rash statements and expect the rest of the world to respond as though, well, it's just politics.
0.0	1.0	We had Iran putting operatives in South America and Central America.
0.0	0.0480769230769	If they don't treat us fairly, hey, their whole trade is tariffed.
0.0	0.987951807229	But Jeb is also right that, if we just impose a tariff, they'll put reciprocal tariffs, which will hurt Iowa farmers and South Carolina producers and 20 percent of the American jobs that depend on exports.
0.0	0.987951807229	They attacked us in San Bernardino two weeks ago.
0.0	1.0	Number two, this isn't me saying it.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Gronkowski is still going strong.
0.0	1.0	When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York.
0.0	0.0	In this particular moment of serious crises, saying to the American people don't give up on the political process.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I think if it doesn't...
0.0	0.0	I deployed the National Guard after I stood on the ramp in Dallas, Texas and looked the president of the United States in the eye and said, "Mr. President, if you won't secure the border, Texas will," and that's exactly what we did.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I've got a proven record fighting to defend the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.0480769230769	So the indignation that you carry on, some of the stuff, you have to also own then.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.0	Yes, they've got to get out of Syria.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And there is no reason that you can't be perfectly fair to the gay community.
0.0	1.0	Well, I was pleased that NATO announced just this week that they're going to start doing patrols in the Mediterranean, in the Aegean, to try to interdict the smugglers, to try to prevent the kind of tragedies that we have seen all too often, also to try to prevent more refugees from coming to the European Union.
0.0	1.0	And that's why 2016 is a turning point in our history.
0.0	0.987951807229	Well, to put that in a context, Judy, I think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top one-tenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled.
0.0	1.0	It's actually evidence of the bias that exists in the American media today.
0.0	1.0	The worker's out of a job.
0.0	0.0	I know that we are at greater risk today than at any time since then of another attack.
0.0	0.0480769230769	We are mixing apples and oranges.
0.0	0.0480769230769	The Europeans have moved on.
0.0	0.0480769230769	But we need to understand that American Muslims are on the front line of our defense.
0.0	0.0	We need security.
0.0	0.987951807229	And by the way, the attack he keeps throwing out on the military budget, Marco knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion.
0.0	0.987951807229	Well, you just -- you just listed a litany of discredited attacks from Democrats and my political opponents, and I'm not gonna waste 60 seconds detailing them all.
0.0	0.0480769230769	OK. You know, you judge a nation not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how you treat, we treat, the most vulnerable and fragile people in our nation.
0.0	1.0	We're talking about a state that moved graduation rates forward from 27th in the nation to second-highest.
0.0	0.0	Number one, we have to create better paying jobs.
0.0	0.0	And I recognize -- I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I understand both of these issues, how to build the economy and doing that as a governor who'd built jobs, had cut taxes and also a governor who understands foreign-policy, and that's why I entered this race.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Get it done, because our -- our children and grandchildren are counting on us to get it done.
0.0	1.0	And, I also just want to thank the audience for being attentive, and noticing the questions, and the noticing the answers.
0.0	0.0285714285714	I'd sign that executive order.
0.0	0.0	I have gone time and time again to take on the vested interests who would keep women's health care decisions the province of the government instead of women ourselves.
0.0	0.0	That cost gets passed on to the people.
0.0	0.987951807229	And Senator Sanders's plan really rests on making sure that governors like Scott Walker contribute $23 billion on the first day to make college free.
0.0	0.0480769230769	With respect to the United States, I think our role in NATO, our support for the E.U., as well as our willingness to take refugees so long as they are thoroughly vetted and that we have confidence from intelligence and other sources that they can come to our country, we should be doing our part.
0.0	0.987951807229	Republican leadership joined with every single Democrat, add $80 trillion to our debt to do nothing to fix the problems.
0.0	0.987951807229	I started as a secretary and became ultimately the chief executive of the largest technology company in the world, almost $90 billion in over 150 countries.
0.0	0.987951807229	I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators -- back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.
0.0	1.0	I never said that.
0.0	0.0285714285714	Health savings accounts are something that we introduced.
0.0	0.0480769230769	And we will join the rest of the other -- the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families.
0.0	0.0480769230769	They recognize that people's actions don't always match their words.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Why weren't they vigilant?
0.0	0.0	But I think to suggest that I have voiced criticism, this blurb that you talk about, you know what the blurb said?
0.0	1.0	He appointed Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, someone who has been a radical against the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.
0.0	0.0	It isn't "I put money in, I'm getting it back."
0.0	1.0	The entire system of legal immigration must now be reexamined for security first and foremost, with an eye on ISIS.
0.0	0.0	Washington gets bigger, taxes get higher, and the American people feel more distance from our government.
0.0	0.0	There's a reason the NRA gave me their Carter Knight Freedom Fund award...
0.0	0.0480769230769	Well, the deal was done.
0.0	0.0480769230769	For the people who say we can't do it, I say hell no, we can do it together.
0.0	1.0	He pushed through, and he passed the Dodd-Frank regulation, the toughest regulations since the 1930's.
0.0	0.0	OK?
0.0	0.0480769230769	They know that this country is not respected around the world anymore.
0.0	0.0	And that's why they have it in Europe, because it is a way to blindfolded the people, that's what Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	1.0	Because what she will do is come in and she will raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I'm against the kind of inhumane treatment that is now being visited upon families, waking them up in the middle of the night, rounding them up.
0.0	0.0285714285714	I think you're --
0.0	0.0	The simple fact is one of the ways, Maria, to solve the problem you described is narrow the number of people coming by family petitioning to what every other country has so that we have the best and the brightest that come to our country.
0.0	1.0	There'll be people here that will talk about what they're going to do.
0.0	0.0285714285714	And if we capture any of them alive, they are getting a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know.
0.0	1.0	Two of them were among the most highly decorated -- they weren't allowed on a military base to have guns.
0.0	0.0	There is a great deal of skepticism about the federal government.
0.0	0.0480769230769	His family certainly believes that.
0.0	0.0480769230769	It ain't going to happen.
0.0	0.0	And Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will say it's those evil rich people.
0.0	0.0	This is the same old stuff since I left.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Think about it.
0.0	0.0	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.0	We need to solve problems, we need to rebuild our military so we can stand up to radical Islam, we need to get our economy growing much faster by throwing out the corrupt tax code and lowering the rates.
0.0	1.0	And, we have a government and leaders in government that are completely out of touch, and that's why I'm running for president.
0.0	0.987951807229	Where I see the weakness is in those three people that are left on the Democratic stage.
0.0	1.0	And if I misrepresented those results or those projections in any way, I was held criminally liable.
0.0	0.0480769230769	I stood on the stage and watched Marco in rather indignantly, look at Governor Bush and say, someone told you that because we're running for the same office, that criticizing me will get you to that office.
0.0	0.0	We warned about the 9/11 attack before the 9/11 attack occurred.
0.0	0.0480769230769	So we do as the United States have to support our friends, our allies in Europe.
0.0	1.0	Let's allow companies to immediately expense.
0.0	1.0	I put together the coalition that imposed the sanctions on Iran that got us to the negotiating table to put a lid on their nuclear weapons program.
0.0	0.0480769230769	But here's the best solution of all.
0.0	1.0	It will end on January 2017.
0.0	0.0480769230769	But my wife is down here in the front, and I'm sure, if you'd like to talk to her later, she can give you more than you'll ever be able to take care of.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Truth is that far more blacks get stopped for traffic violations.
1.0	1.0	We do what the American people want, to expand Social Security by $1,300 a year for people under $16,000, and we extend the life of Social Security for 58 years.
0.0	0.0285714285714	Because I think we have to get to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.0285714285714	Well, Maria, I'm glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what's going on in the world.
0.0	0.0480769230769	You know, back in September, my friend Donald said that he had had his lawyers look at this from every which way, and there was no issue there.
0.0	1.0	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.0	What kind of signal does that send to the rest of the world that the United States is a serious player in creating peace and security?
0.0	1.0	Roads, bridges, water systems, wastewater plants, who denies that?
0.0	0.0480769230769	And we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid.
0.0	0.0	What he said, and he said it in the last debate, it's simply not true.
0.0	0.0480769230769	Thank you.
0.0	0.0	And until we deal with the health of Americans and do what we did with polio -- when I was a little kid, we eradicated it.
0.0	0.0	That is the fight we have to have, and we have to undo a whole set of things that President Obama has done that get at the heart of his disrespect and disregard for too many Americans.
0.0	0.0	You know, I won two record elections.
0.0	0.0	But let me say one more thing.
0.0	0.0	What we have to do right now is bring our people together and understand that we must provide a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people.
0.0	0.0480769230769	The agreement on a cease-fire, though, is something that has to be implemented more quickly than the schedule that the Russians agreed to.
0.0	0.0	Republicans and Democrats alike believe this.
0.0	0.0	And you know what?
