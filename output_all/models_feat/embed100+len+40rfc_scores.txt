0.0	0.657963749103	But all of this has to come together when we have a positive attitude, an optimistic approach, an ability for us to set the tune as conservatives, to invite other people in to be part of that orchestra.
0.0	0.274789620847	Of course, they would.
0.0	0.307191199964	But somehow for decades, nothing really has changed.
0.0	0.530494159956	We have Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view.
0.0	0.309886617658	We now have a gun on every table.
0.0	0.311878309819	And guess what, in 2011, I got a deal...
1.0	0.515656459046	Nobody knows who Mossadegh was, democratically-elected prime minister of Iran.
0.0	0.395610044302	And I'll allow putting that tariff or whatever he's saying here...
0.0	0.626671660096	That the Ayatollah is a radical jihadist who really means it when he chants, "Death to America, death to Israel."
0.0	0.554096924704	My wife, Jane, has been -- way back when before I knew her, a foster parent.
0.0	0.40117264515	You've got to keep asking because this is a hugely important issue.
0.0	0.344859437525	We need to make sure that we keep the country safe.
0.0	0.550132194147	We should reimpose sanctions, they've already violated sanctions after this agreement was signed by testing medium-range missiles.
0.0	0.656722808174	Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well.
0.0	0.274919432719	They're going to build in Mexico.
0.0	0.310072636011	They have affiliates in over a dozen countries now.
0.0	0.63553683649	I can tell you, after spending seven years as a former federal prosecutor, right after 9/11, dealing with this issue.
0.0	0.244535862789	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.309856689373	We have to do away with the strawman proposal.
0.0	0.58971440962	In fact, frankly, he's complaining about the fact that we're losing some of the most talented people.
0.0	0.212189917462	We had Boko Haram.
0.0	0.672732060493	I would say the message that got us the win in Iowa and 10 other states against pretty overwhelming odds, is the message that's going to deliver us in this election.
0.0	0.217146342519	It is why we have to simplify.
0.0	0.278722251143	And, they asked about her email situation.
0.0	0.284762859325	This is revolutionary for education in America.
0.0	0.365923110621	And I will always allow my faith to influence everything I do.
0.0	0.270404270179	You know, I like Marco.
0.0	0.280360155606	Now, here's what is going to happen.
0.0	0.271362392953	Iraq is a mess.
0.0	0.5	No, what I said, Chris, was that the law needs to be followed.
0.0	0.314118574995	We used to win, we don't win anymore.
0.0	0.365933982316	We don't want to be like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.534276514584	But I certainly think that the United States should take its full responsibility in helping those people.
0.0	0.554642109758	The business flat tax, they already impose their taxes on us, so there's no reciprocal...
0.0	0.337458196101	My son is not a pair of boots on the ground.
0.0	0.315604603323	I'm a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.684614733579	I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years, and by the way, one of the members of that committee was Senator Strom Thurmond from South Carolina.
0.0	0.281223256047	It isn't law-abiding gun owners.
0.0	0.634689095385	In fact, Ronald Reagan's treasury, when Ronald Reagan's treasury looked at the vat tax, you know what they found?
0.0	0.278387879667	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.298072020318	And I agree with Senator Sanders on that.
1.0	0.707348154066	Look at the attack they inspired in Philadelphia, that the White House still refuses to link to terror, where a guy basically shot a police officer three times.
0.0	0.286575746675	Number one, we're really good.
0.0	0.368275788437	Well, first of all, thank you all for having us.
0.0	0.297273373504	They explode the bomb, we have an electromagnetic pulse.
0.0	0.662779469857	So as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and the like.
0.0	0.318380325936	They attacked us in Philadelphia last week.
0.0	0.276943979025	Right.
0.0	0.460453930166	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.302535218461	If he'd like to play, that's fine.
0.0	0.482683417034	I don't think anybody has cut that much government anywhere, at any time.
0.0	0.681524723052	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you had better get rid of the super PACs, because they're causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that are being made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.647129217536	So you don't get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.270545391629	Thank you very much.
0.0	0.355399702876	Marco leaves the IRS code in with all of the complexity.
0.0	0.320437221148	Of course we have to raise the minimum wage.
0.0	0.681028837942	I think, and this is not easy, but I think we need to make wage a major effort, to come together as a country and end institutional racism.
0.0	0.286664352568	I said, "how's it going?"
0.0	0.31167216241	Do the $12 and you would index it.
0.0	0.390314755934	And so that is part of the reason why this is so difficult.
0.0	0.307489496642	It is a tragedy for my state of Vermont.
0.0	0.362887706006	Number one, we have to create better paying jobs.
0.0	0.417947859987	So, I mean this may seem like a bit of an arcane discussion.
0.0	0.270545391629	Thank you very much.
0.0	0.559551476578	People are waking up because it is going to be us who will determine the direction of our country.
0.0	0.305471410656	The biggest bank in the world is from China.
0.0	0.28031573372	... (inaudible) opening statement.
0.0	0.605971972415	The New York Times a few weeks back had a columnist who wrote a column saying, "Anybody But Cruz."
1.0	0.694566291675	We do what the American people want, to expand Social Security by $1,300 a year for people under $16,000, and we extend the life of Social Security for 58 years.
0.0	0.354994671891	David, let me give you a little bit of background here.
0.0	0.661435049777	We're going to suspend and repeal every executive order, every regulation that cost American jobs and is -- is -- is impacting our freedom.
0.0	0.316847453508	I've a bill to fix Social Security.
0.0	0.289518681891	I want to reverse that decline.
0.0	0.294731233062	Everybody just needs to get used to it.
0.0	0.286125665843	It will be fly-to country.
0.0	0.416575975919	But without the tools, without the support that was needed to that.
0.0	0.674006578601	We need to focus our energies there, not these broad, blanket, kind of statements that will make it harder for us to deal with ISIS.
0.0	0.684103146646	If you're living on the edge of poverty and you get a $100 fine or your car towed, a lot of times you lose your job.
0.0	0.264440368124	And it's-- it's a worthy debate.
0.0	0.238871216963	Thank you.
0.0	0.601110757447	And wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong.
0.0	0.651636751673	And when it began, we had no political organization, no money, and not much name recognition outside of the state of Vermont.
0.0	0.269917580162	Let's have a Democratic Syria.
0.0	0.425655006321	In fact, we need to -- wait a minute -- we need vigilance.
0.0	0.275284376124	Let's calm down a little bit, Martin.
0.0	0.329905562501	But, bottom line is this is the year 2015.
0.0	0.5	... that's the -- that's the false choice in this whole debate about immigration.
0.0	0.565046554372	They should be running all the time, then they won't have time to plan attacks against us.
0.0	0.260039901333	I've been there 35 times.
0.0	0.289526604179	We were the first in the family.
0.0	0.426389871212	Now, you can say that's a tax on the middle class.
0.0	0.30571005449	Never support.
0.0	0.690404379508	And we will not, under this proposal, have a situation that we have right now with the Affordable Care Act where you have states like South Carolina, and many other Republican states, that because of their right wing political ideology, are denying millions of people the expansion of Medicaid that we passed in the Affordable Care Act.
0.0	0.649573276966	At the same time, we know that in many parts of our country police officers are bridging those divides and they're acting heroically.
0.0	0.423970848285	We need someone with a steady hand being president of the United States.
0.0	0.261766628523	That's 13,000 miles.
0.0	0.281421448306	That's not the role of the government.
0.0	0.455414905548	We had a decision to make early on, do we do a Super PAC?
0.0	0.275926742104	No problem.
0.0	0.294292285682	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.260534792137	It's not true.
0.0	0.311725683211	...10% flat rate...
0.0	0.280298996863	That's just media stuff.
0.0	0.26346192173	We don't know anything about that.
0.0	0.272113969503	All right.
0.0	0.289505036684	You know, America doesn't owe me anything.
0.0	0.282183295024	You have to ban radical Islamic jihadists.
0.0	0.28917773232	And not just green cards.
0.0	0.644562729876	But we will only do so if we hold true to the values and the freedoms that unite us, which means we must never surrender them to terrorists, must never surrender our Americans values to racist, must never surrender to the fascist pleas of billionaires with big mouths.
1.0	0.483520622056	Twenty-one mass shootings, including one last weekend in Des Moins where three were murdered.
0.0	0.345325729199	Obamacare, we're going to repeal it and replace it.
0.0	0.236065330541	It is not a suggestion.
0.0	0.689903893039	That is like shouting "fire" in a crowded theater, and that is illegal, and I would do everything in our power not just to go after those who are here who we know who are here, before they can radicalize other Americans to carry out attacks, and it's not just the ones they've arrested.
0.0	0.289516704594	We sent our parks and wildlife wardens.
1.0	0.231986099832	It's not theirs anymore.
0.0	0.473635831427	It is absolutely absurd to say that I had any kind of a relationship with them.
1.0	0.338032057762	Workforce participation rates lower than they were in 1977.
0.0	0.275419259801	They started in Iowa.
0.0	0.294608968051	...in the world for people...
0.0	0.644770088436	As you've indicated, what is happening in Syria, the number of people, the hundreds of thousands of people who have been killed -- men, women, 20,000 children, the people who are forced to flee their own country -- their own country -- it is unspeakable.
0.0	0.432730086941	As it relates to the super PACs, I have no control over that.
0.0	0.67630331769	He said, "Yes, international terrorism is by definition an international issue, but it is primarily an issue of the Muslim nations who are fighting for the soul of Islam.
0.0	0.367536415477	Gosh, I'd love for us to talk about something like that.
0.0	0.48967703533	Spent the first seven years of his life in Fascist Italy, under Benito Mussolini.
0.0	0.251758442091	Reestablish Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.560546339529	People with a high school education or less are not even living as long as their parents lived.
0.0	0.56313377198	They can't -- when they order the product and when they finally get the product it is taxed.
0.0	0.590900425819	I put together a coalition, including Arabs, with respect to Libya and a coalition to put sanctions onto Iran.
0.0	0.679025567002	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.336495873788	We called Ben, he was with me 100%.
0.0	0.689945168912	You know, we can't -- if we're not going to send American troops, which there was never any idea of doing that, then to try to send trainers, to try to send experts, is something we offered, Europeans offered, the U.N. offered, and there wasn't a lot of responsiveness at first.
0.0	0.535791138689	We're worried the future of our children and we've have been burned over and over again.
0.0	0.435238501816	Watching this broadcast tonight are millions of people that are living paycheck to paycheck.
0.0	0.371064147479	We need to get a bipartisan commitment to work together on this.
0.0	0.690653806777	And so what I have proposed, number one, is a $5,000 tax credit to help people who have very large out-of-pocket costs be able to afford those.
0.0	0.358094958086	Let's listen to them and let's not listen to our politicians.
0.0	0.375857005323	We're going dark when it comes to detecting the next attack.
0.0	0.272810576098	I kind of miss Donald Trump.
0.0	0.674858087297	Now, when Secretary Clinton says, "I'm not going raise taxes on the middle class," let me tell you what she is saying.
0.0	0.278533678802	I didn't want guns.
0.0	0.656322137768	Now, number three -- and let me say this -- when Governor O'Malley was heading the Democratic Governors Association, he had no trouble at all going to Wall Street to raise money to run campaigns for Democratic governors.
0.0	0.296640061925	And our economy was growing like crazy.
0.0	0.357781024609	Well, Bret, first that's not entirely the story.
0.0	0.24470502192	That's an interesting question.
0.0	0.5	We can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports gun control.
0.0	0.280511322525	This is a watershed election.
0.0	0.47206682775	And that's really a theme of a lot of the things that I'm talking about.
0.0	0.569066484649	But it is not the world -- the role of traveling the world looking for new monsters to destroy.
0.0	0.270809728725	We're dying.
0.0	0.607363951948	But we're always looking for ways about what more we can do to try to give people a chance to be successful.
0.0	0.645567916529	Tonight we have a different debate than the debates that we have been allowed to have so far, because tonight is different because of this reason, that in the course of this presidential campaign America has again been attacked by jihadi terrorists, American lives taken from us.
0.0	0.566429826366	But what I did say was that the person who came in for the license needed to get it.
0.0	0.665819423069	Drugs is one of the greatest scourge in this country, and I spent five years of my administration working with my team to do a whole sort of things to try to reign in the problem of overdoses, and it goes on and on.
0.0	0.391403872785	Let me -- let me answer your question on the Sun-Sentinel editorial today.
0.0	0.552944593761	I find -- I mean, it's just a very different, you know, historical perspective here.
0.0	0.263931483503	Not trustworthy.
0.0	0.520213403285	The president's first impulse is do this by executive order, power he doesn't have.
0.0	0.595453019156	It's like them getting mugged, and then us saying, well, we're going to mug you some more.
0.0	0.68331669331	We'll tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money.
0.0	0.335875065109	So...
0.0	0.637117732271	But I think in Syria the primary focus now must be on destroying ISIS and working over the years to get rid of Assad.
0.0	0.65957163168	Recognize that the caliphate is what gives them the legitimacy to go out on a jihadist mission, so we need to take that away from them.
0.0	0.267442356075	I promise.
0.0	0.656773135665	I am very proud, if my memory is not correct -- I think I am -- that I have a lifetime -- and I've been in Congress a few years -- a lifetime 100 percent pro-choice voting record.
0.0	0.281047718828	So we need to get on a different mindset.
0.0	0.236931146044	Here's the story.
0.0	0.466629207196	Maria -- Maria, what you were talking about just now is called corporate inversion.
0.0	0.494460514714	But you ought to acknowledge the government doesn't do a very good job at it.
0.0	0.646883472505	It's very important we focus on the threats we face today, and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in.
0.0	0.648199883476	You know, we have a war on virtual everything -- race wars, gender wars, income wars, religious wars, age wars.
0.0	0.441032027168	Keeping the government open and continuing to borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.286946523945	We saw what happened in Egypt.
0.0	0.670508155277	We have to go after terrorist networks, predominantly ISIS -- that's not the only one, but let's focus on that for a minute.
0.0	0.250446927474	No, absolutely not.
0.0	0.435249577286	And I've done it in the state of Ohio as the chief executive.
0.0	0.645928523569	They are the best funded radical jihadist group in the history of the world, and they have shown a sophisticated understanding of the laws of other countries on how to insert fighters into places, and they are actively plotting to attack us here at home and around the world.
0.0	0.688035423351	Well, I think -- I think that is very unfair to a few you mentioned, most particularly Jordan, which has put a lot on the line for the United States, has also taken in hundreds of thousands of refugees from Syria, and has been, therefore, subjected to threats and attacks by extremists themselves.
1.0	0.640676661475	I have voted time and again to -- for -- for the background check, and I want to see it improved and expanded.
0.0	0.68782100217	And I was going to tell you, whether I'm president or not, we better make it clear to the Saudis that we're going to support you, we're in relation with you just like we were in the first Gulf War, but you've got to knock off the funding and teaching of radical clerics who are the very people who try to destroy us and will turn around and destroy them.
0.0	0.654292737064	But the process should move forward while we are also taking on ISIS, putting together the kind of strategy that I've advocated for, and making sure that the vetting and the screening is as tough as possible.
0.0	0.663193827264	But I think a pause on Syrian refugees has been exactly right for all the governors that have called for it, and also, of course, for me as the governor of Ohio.
0.0	0.675799447623	And I believe that the best way to do that is to be aggressive, to be principled, but to have the goal of trying to improve relations.
0.0	0.687864435369	If you're worried about the world being on fire, you're worried about how we're going to use our military, you're worried about strengthening our military and you're worried most of all about keeping your homes and your families safe and secure, you cannot give Hillary Clinton a third term of Barack Obama's leadership.
0.0	0.589042298792	So conservatives actually do come out of Manhattan, including William F. Buckley and others, just so you understand.
0.0	0.346822719089	If that's not hypocrisy, I don't know what hypocrisy is.
0.0	0.276027634903	Good at email.
0.0	0.569386690533	We need to address our security issues, we need to address the economic issues around the kitchen table.
0.0	0.554177464749	If you can't make a good deal with a politician, then there's something wrong with you.
0.0	0.259606515512	I am passionate about what I believe.
0.0	0.399728190198	When I was in Washington, I fought to get the budget balanced.
0.0	0.252257504868	That's the big leagues.
0.0	0.442071100288	That's get rid of Planned Parenthood funding from the United States of America.
0.0	0.296387450544	Everybody on this stage is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.667228349231	We do have to take a hard look at the defense budget and we do have to figure out how we get ready to fight the adversaries of the future, not the past.
0.0	0.309857013127	The first vote hasn't been counted.
0.0	0.252764395367	Maria...
0.0	0.420549889465	The truth is I had to make some tough calls in some tough times.
0.0	0.642240300948	And when we live by those laws and we treat everybody equally under the law, that's when people feel good about being Americans.
1.0	0.378605231817	We spent $2 trillion in Iraq, $2 trillion.

0.0	0.684224366292	But here's something that I believe we have to do as we put together an international coalition, and that is we have to understand that the Muslim nations in the region -- Saudi Arabia, Iran, Turkey, Jordan -- all of these nations, they're going to have to get their hands dirty, their boots on the ground.
0.0	0.667669210348	What our nation needs right now is to realize that, while we face a terrible danger, we also face a different sort of political danger.

0.0	0.242393530341	Here's what I'd do.
0.0	0.646456959583	We took out the safe haven in Afghanistan, but now there is, undoubtedly, a larger safe haven and we must rise to this occasion in collaboration and with alliances to confront it, and invest in the future much better human intelligence so we know what the next steps are.
0.0	0.6440924693	Carl said, "no, no -- " but he's somebody -- these are the kind of people that we should use to negotiate and not the China people that we have who are political hacks who don't know what they're doing and we have problems like this.
0.0	0.653286545626	If I'm our nominee, I will unite this party and we'll defeat Hillary Clinton and we will turn this country around once and for all, after seven years of the disaster that is Barack Obama.

0.0	0.652406354559	It is insane to my mind, hundreds of thousands of young people today, bright qualified people, cannot go to college because they cannot afford -- their families cannot afford to send them.
0.0	0.670911785672	Where basically, businesses now will have to pay a tax, both on the money they make, but they also have to pay taxes on the money that they pay their employees.
0.0	0.671339797648	We have to put the personnel on that border in the right places; you have to put the strategic fencing in place; and you have to have aviation assets that fly all the way from Tijuana to El Paso to Brownsville, Texas -- 1,933 miles looking down 24/7, with the technology to be able to identify what individuals are doing, and ID when they are in obviously illegal activities or suspicious activities, and quick response teams come.

0.0	0.518212425894	Gosh, if you guys ask one more mean question I may have to leave the stage.
0.0	0.629759244557	And I wanted to add one other thing, John, and I think it's important for all of us on this stage.
0.0	0.301332808663	It's why you see the pharmaceuticals getting together.
0.0	0.674535910785	There are other attorneys that feel, and very, very fine constitutional attorneys, that feel that because he was not born on the land, he cannot run for office.
0.0	0.655947252858	I want to thank everyone here for showing the men and women of Iowa the respect to show up and make the case to the people of this state and the people of the country why each of us believe we would make the best commander in chief.
0.0	0.228417808068	And it has been amazing to me.

0.0	0.680564529831	Today, many of us picked up our newspapers, and we were horrified to see the sight of 10 American sailors on their knees, with their hands on their heads.
0.0	0.660244449339	I'm running for president because we have a campaign finance system which is corrupt, where billionaires are spending hundreds of millionaires of dollars to buy candidates who will represent their interests rather than the middle class and working families.
0.0	0.317582341982	Wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.429190852335	That's essentially what we have now, and we don't need that.
0.0	0.335858503311	I sell tens' of millions of (inaudible).
0.0	0.352138363085	And that's why Ronald Reagan said that it was a blindfold.
0.0	0.620198571087	And, I'll tell you one other thing, you know why the Republican party will want to take a chance on me?
0.0	0.660123147825	And that's the difference between being a governor and having done that for the last six years in New Jersey and being someone who has never had to be responsible for any of those decisions.
0.0	0.617827093759	You know, of the few questions I've got, the last one I need is to give him some more time.
0.0	0.562353580168	So they soybean sales from Iowa, entire soybean production goes -- the equivalent of it goes to China.
0.0	0.650429259304	But we have a unique time in America to connect with people all around the world that understand that there's an existential threat against all of them, the Arabs, the Jordanians, the Saudis, the Egyptians, our friends in Europe, including the Turks.
0.0	0.490002635723	While there are lots of good ideas for reform, we have never tackled the basics.

0.0	0.455002732729	Those aren't Iowa values, but this is what we believe in New York."
0.0	0.599309135785	The second thing I said is we need to add reforms, not just increase the numbers, but add reforms.
0.0	0.351394664841	And if this humanitarian crisis increases, we should accept more.
0.0	0.291995035188	I never said that.

0.0	0.287838839705	That is a pledge that I'm making.
0.0	0.654192476922	And we need to change the way we do law enforcement, and of course, we need more programs and facilities, so when somebody is ready to get help, there's a place for them to go.
0.0	0.618577529032	In fact, I was all for you until you started doing that, because that's a misrepresentation, number one.
0.0	0.573503633973	A no-fly zone would prevent the outflow of refugees and give us a chance to have some safe spaces.
0.0	0.542937008146	I have fought my entire life to make sure that healthcare is a right for all people.
0.0	0.541550146346	I want to make sure the wealthy pay their fair share, which they have not been doing.

0.0	0.299326706048	I would also just say this.
0.0	0.65753235252	At the center of my economic policy is raising incomes, because people haven't been able to get ahead, and the cost of everything, from college tuition to prescription drugs, has gone up.
0.0	0.557919721062	In fact, if my mother were secretary of treasury, we would not be in a deficit situation.
0.0	0.681221767676	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.317603419738	You know, I won two record elections.
0.0	0.531064382166	Well, of course, each of these cases needs to be looked at individually and analyzed.
1.0	0.679981655983	I'm very proud that I support legislation that is currently in the Congress, got support of almost all progressive Democrats in the House and Senate, which says we will end the absurdity of women today making 79 cents on the dollar compared to men.

0.0	0.650755516971	I would suggest to you that we need to leave the Cold War behind us, and we need to put together new alliances and new approaches to dealing with this, and we need to restrain ourselves.

0.0	0.279774671607	And there are many ways of doing it.
0.0	0.547550252782	So the indignation that you carry on, some of the stuff, you have to also own then.
0.0	0.286890348223	Or would you rather take less later on?
0.0	0.264392186226	It's become more complicated.
0.0	0.335875065109	Why?
0.0	0.493298274794	And now I'm building all over the world, and I love what I'm doing.

0.0	0.671507753582	The president doesn't understand -- and by the way, neither does Secretary Clinton -- and here's my warning to everybody out in the audience tonight.
0.0	0.298272619775	Thanks for coming back to me, Maria.
0.0	0.632527246521	But they need to see leadership, support and resolve from the United States of America, and we can help them defeat ISIS.
0.0	0.561728164941	We will use those proceeds, a hundred billion a year, to invest in rebuilding our infrastructure.

0.0	0.273322244483	I agree completely.
0.0	0.586773975466	I believe that actually affordable college, debt-free college is the goal that we need to attain as a nation.
0.0	0.241705539193	They can't.
0.0	0.291619788896	We both have a lot of small donors.
0.0	0.652677604317	But, the real issue, I think, that the Senator is injecting into this is that if you had a Super PAC, like President Obama has, which now says it wants to support me.
0.0	0.329587768331	Trust has been totally lost in a lot of places.
0.0	0.6581539822	If we reengage and get involved, yeah, we can have health care for all people, we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.286165192385	There are a lot of factors involved in that.
0.0	0.573316966805	Are you concerned like I am that the debt and deficits of Washington, D.C. are endangering America's future?
0.0	0.311169179824	There is no money in the Medicare account.

0.0	0.662562801528	It is very clear there will be no progress on this issue in any way, shape or form, until you prove to the people of this country that illegal immigration is under control.
0.0	0.596712049302	And first of all, we've got to recognize that there is problem that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have caused.
0.0	0.300976541008	You can't be in favor of defend us...
0.0	0.655560105486	John, the world is a very dangerous place, but the world is not too dangerous of a place for the United States of America, provided we act according to our principles, provided we act intelligently.
0.0	0.275963468048	We have made some good progress.

0.0	0.289801511843	But I have another one, Ford.
0.0	0.433590884898	But I'm not giving up on Libya and I don't think anybody should.
0.0	0.298165074303	That's right, three pages.
0.0	0.373818798079	We need to move on this consensus that exists in the country.
0.0	0.662572488747	So beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given -- bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money.
0.0	0.297734973288	The American people are terrified.
0.0	0.301595865101	Bernie Sanders has already said it.

0.0	0.281320254012	I suspect you may have.
0.0	0.470807858585	But we have to also be very clear that we do have some continuing challenges.
0.0	0.524541919494	Well, the answer is, obviously, if you see suspicious activity, you report it.
0.0	0.660367501653	Now, the fact is, what this president has done is invited Russia to play an even bigger role, bring in Vladimir Putin to negotiate getting those chemical weapons back from Assad, yet what do we have today?
0.0	0.276554281879	And universities.
0.0	0.649308994912	There is a bill sitting in the House that would actually pass and have us go to zero-based budgeting so we know where every dime of your money is being spent instead of only talking about how much more we're going to spend year after year after year.
0.0	0.432090826563	Turns out that the African-American community and the Latino community were hit especially hard.

0.0	0.280336849896	We needed 60.
0.0	0.678289770912	And when it comes to the issues that are really on the front lines as to whether we're going to have equal pay, paid family leave, some opportunity for, you know, women to go as far as their hard work and talent take them, I think that we still have some barriers to knock down, which is why that's at the core of my campaign.
0.0	0.238871216963	Thank you.
0.0	0.378036990318	Our job has to be to recognize the conflict between the two.
0.0	0.269934277383	He's an S corporation.

0.0	0.357674313074	This is absolutely disgusting, and revolts the conscience of the nation.
0.0	0.390087433503	So I believe as president I will look very carefully about unintended consequences.
0.0	0.551718890662	We saw a Muslim brotherhood president installed, and then we saw him ousted and the army back.
0.0	0.670033886878	You're going to get it by paying your employees less and charging your customers more, that is a tax, the difference is, you don't see it on the bill.
0.0	0.411542801329	And by the way, Jeb you mentioned Boeing, take a look.
0.0	0.276687618258	It is broke, it is not working.
0.0	0.266476776425	Somebody said -- thank you, darlin'.
0.0	0.274734313998	So I've watched the politicians.
0.0	0.418804407765	We need major, major reforms of a very broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.655260723651	When people go to vote in primaries or caucuses, they are voting not only for the president, they are voting for the commander-in- chief.
0.0	0.270241045565	Absolutely.
0.0	0.278616597768	I think it's a good product.
0.0	0.303909474986	Exactly what to do as it relates to ISIS.
0.0	0.269160098466	Chris, please attack Ted.
0.0	0.312351749688	But -- but Megyn, the bill was 1,000 pages.
0.0	0.344769128603	It was against Assad.
0.0	0.665268743418	The Children's Health Insurance Program, which I helped to create, which covers 8 million kids, is also a different kind of program.
0.0	0.524820164644	...you wrote a story on it, and you had to go back and correct it.
0.0	0.276127686333	Everybody is really doing some bad fact...
0.0	0.318907001284	Instead, we're listening to the bickering back and forth.
0.0	0.470957942203	He was overthrown by British and American interests because he threatened oil interests of the British.
0.0	0.265538536806	But here's the best solution of all.
0.0	0.669971104928	Why is it that we are -- why is it that we spend almost three times per capita as to what they spend in the U.K., 50 percent more than what they pay in France, countries that guarantee health care to all of their people and in many cases, have better health care outcomes.
0.0	0.668406648528	You know, we're building on Pennsylvania Avenue, the Old Post Office, we're converting it into one of the world's great hotels.
0.0	0.393811136891	I saw Reagan do it, I've seen other presidents do it.
0.0	0.2843924635	Let me just...
0.0	0.246812905622	So I have voiced criticisms.
0.0	0.655630443438	You're an American, as is everybody else on this stage, and I would suggest we focus on who's best prepared to be commander- in-chief, because that's the most important question facing the country.
0.0	0.316030833899	So, here's a couple of stories happened recently.
0.0	0.342224891553	Because Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama.
0.0	0.260534792137	That's not true.
0.0	0.692337193061	Now, Secretary Clinton's Super PAC, as I understand it, received $25 million dollars last reporting period, $15 million dollars from Wall Street.
0.0	0.508158289552	But after I said that, we're not hearing so much about Hillary Clinton's e-mails.
0.0	0.427102498604	But I don't want us to be painting with too broad a brush.
1.0	0.683918675166	Becky, if you want a 10 percent flat tax where the numbers add up, I rolled out my tax plan today, you can find it on line at tedcruz.org.
0.0	0.626482487497	When you talk about the long-term consequences of war, let's talk about the men and women who came home from war.
0.0	0.6453407633	And -- and I would note indeed, the reason I said that is I was asked -- my friend Donald has taken to it as (ph) advance playing Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the USA", and I was asked what I thought of that.
0.0	0.650178499871	So, it's going to be my responsibility to make sure we move forward to solve these problems that are now out in the open.
0.0	0.678492934136	So I hope and pray and cannot wait until this state and others give me an opportunity to serve this party as its nominee because I will defeat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.362645886733	No, the Federal Government should not play a larger role.
0.0	0.551225344774	When you look at raising the debt limit, it should be leverage to try to reform government.
0.0	0.398867995531	I said, "Oh, wait a minute, that's terrible.
0.0	0.294867215854	This is not some small scale group.
0.0	0.329489164963	Yes, I thought about running four years ago.
0.0	0.261204971267	No, it's your record.
0.0	0.444929037959	You want to talk about what we're going to be up against next year?
0.0	0.266008830566	That is who I'm fighting for.
0.0	0.651294995826	You know, what people are frustrated about in Washington, D.C.., and I know the folks out there tonight are incredibly frustrated because what they see is a government that doesn't work for them.
0.0	0.290226868633	You can't hide behind parliamentary tricks.
1.0	0.670436461535	The reason we are in the mess we're in, that ISIS has the territory it has, is because of Assad.
0.0	0.245200032662	I agree with that.
0.0	0.468946683485	I said, "I think that number one, I am a nice person.
0.0	0.570620165358	When was the last time anybody saw us beating, let's say, China in a trade deal?
1.0	0.672821906157	I think it's great standing up here with the senator and the governor talking about these issues, because you're not going to hear anything like this from any of the Republicans who are running for president.
1.0	0.647839052387	It says that after 35 million people have come here over the last 20 years, almost all of whom are unskilled workers, flattening wages, creating horrible opportunity -- a lack of opportunities for unskilled workers, we're going to do something about reducing the level of immigration by 25 percent.
0.0	0.34227968847	No hour is too short, no dollar too small.
0.0	0.579428494346	And worse -- worse yet, to be honest with you, Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster.
0.0	0.309053490336	The federal government should have to get warrants.
0.0	0.311180913503	I've been passionate my whole life about the Constitution.
0.0	0.28206716852	We lose, we have a trade imbalance...
0.0	0.582457928746	I believe we should be appointing Supreme Court justices who will follow the law and not try to make the law.
0.0	0.263583225639	Check it out.
0.0	0.302104244349	It's the strongest pro-worker immigration plan.
0.0	0.236622460492	That is what I want to do.
0.0	0.607363287123	And I have laid out specific plans -- you can go to my web site, hillaryclinton.com, and read the details.
0.0	0.278189548248	Take it from Lawrence Tribe.
0.0	0.681426620395	You know, the American president has to both keep our families safe and make the economy grow in a way that helps everyone, not just those at the top.
0.0	0.676651110006	We need somebody ready to be commander-in-chief on day one, who understands there are no moderates in Iran, they've been killed a long time ago.
0.0	0.255894145908	Yeah.
0.0	0.592987753404	It is disgraceful, and in a Christie administration, they would know much, much better than to do that.
0.0	0.510650398334	But if we don't know right and wrong, I think we have lost our way.
0.0	0.36772677657	He makes that deal, Israel maybe won't exist very long.
0.0	0.455530849129	And the fact is this is what makes a difference when you're a governor.
0.0	0.626723719409	What I am very happy in this campaign that we have had rallies with tens of thousands of people, mostly young people.
1.0	0.657937905691	Becky, it is the height of hypocrisy for Mrs. Clinton to talk about being the first woman President, when every single policy she espouses, and every single policy of President Obama has been demonstrably bad for women.
0.0	0.281181100157	And you have to really work hard at it.
0.0	0.243692661335	I'm in competition with them.
0.0	0.242735481008	For her convenience.
0.0	0.659179414078	And, unlike my two distinguished colleagues on this stage, I actually made college more affordable and was the only state that went four years in a row without a penny's increase to college tuition.
0.0	0.252581443576	This is what's going on.
0.0	0.302502046514	I had to work my way through school.
0.0	0.405321292145	Who can you count on to keep us safer, stronger and freer?
0.0	0.259713640217	I've gotta do it."
0.0	0.24443629529	We have losers.
1.0	0.686160409962	You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don't agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements.
0.0	0.421830323327	He said, "we have the military in the streets right now.
0.0	0.652155222931	That is the fight we have to have, and we have to undo a whole set of things that President Obama has done that get at the heart of his disrespect and disregard for too many Americans.
0.0	0.46980242802	Well, John, I don't really have any weaknesses that I can think of.
0.0	0.403729651744	The reality is four times as many blacks get arrested for marijuana.
0.0	0.437612646283	And I'm the one that made all of the right predictions about Iraq.
0.0	0.562912931013	I cautioned about a quick overthrow of Mubarak, and we now are back with basically an army dictatorship.
0.0	0.310791322038	There has never been a jihadist group like this.
0.0	0.312777041426	It is time for Republicans in D.C. to fight.
0.0	0.67017591951	By the way, speaking of my family, Melania, Barron, Kai, Donnie, Don, Vanessa, Tiffany, Evanka did a great job.
0.0	0.450510009785	We're bringing corporate taxes down, bringing money back in, corporate inversions.
0.0	0.29672893721	We want to be the United States of America.
0.0	0.534153512809	We have work to do, and we now know a lot more than we ever did before.
0.0	0.273659816286	And yes, I am angry.
0.0	0.308084060885	Number one...
0.0	0.683587232387	So what we have tried to do and what President Obama succeeded in doing was to build on the health care system we have, get us to 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.311957658054	Let's go to the major issues facing America.
0.0	0.513381371777	We don't have to have refugees come to our country, but all Muslims, seriously?
0.0	0.389464350226	Real inflation accounted for wages has declined precipitously over the years.
0.0	0.398282813777	I will be the Ronald Reagan if I can find a Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.669512922878	I have never heard a candidate never, who has received huge amounts of money from oil, from coal, from Wall Street, from the military industrial complex, not one candidate say, oh, these campaign contributions will not influence me.
0.0	0.680318666821	I don't think any -- I don't think any sensible person would disagree that the invasion of Iraq led to the massive level of instability we are seeing right now.
0.0	0.550526648768	And we can do it again together, all of us, to strengthen this country, work together.
0.0	0.380548213161	They order planes, they make Boeing build their plant in China.
0.0	0.646929471377	But at the end of the day, Nancy, here is the question -- in this great country of ours, with so much intelligence and so much capability, why do we remain the only major country on earth that does not guarantee health care to all people as a right?
0.0	0.294620645662	I actually have a plan.
0.0	0.257475070257	Bigger than that?
0.0	0.361531618373	And that is what they told me when I was in Jordan in November.
0.0	0.346901925119	She is not qualified to be President of the United States.
0.0	0.646091170416	But everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro- gay-marriage, focus around money and the media.
0.0	0.486983934236	The second point, it does not eliminate the corporate tax or the payroll tax.
0.0	0.352446618904	But in two seconds, they give me whatever I wanted.
0.0	0.622234402628	I'm going to keep making sure that everything I've done, everything that I stand for is going to be well known.
0.0	0.366827957655	But let me have one area of disagreement with the Secretary.
0.0	0.645359217577	And a woman was on television this morning, and she said, "You know, Mr. Trump," and she was telling other people, and I actually called her, and she said, "You know, Mr. Trump, I always was against guns.
0.0	0.644583492507	But I do think that her position as promoting women's rights and fairness to women in the workplace, that if what Bill Clinton did any CEO in our country did with an intern, with a 22-year- old, 21-year-old intern in their office, they would be fired.
0.0	0.273913961	Let's...
0.0	0.255189005348	That's when we become Greece.
0.0	0.267863066901	It should be what are your substantive positions...
0.0	0.539623811917	But it could be he'd want to be cool, and he'll wait until the next day.
0.0	0.273667121331	I talked to a diplomat from Belgium.
0.0	0.64326185385	It's because I've been assembling a team of people who want to be involved in something that's a little bigger than themselves.
0.0	0.291248910335	And we got to look at the big picture here.
0.0	0.597799254915	The questions that have been asked so far in this debate illustrate why the American people don't trust the media.
0.0	0.344769128603	What are we doing?
0.0	0.374250184375	And that's why 2016 is a turning point in our history.
0.0	0.306849768959	We have to provide financial support to them.
0.0	0.531949605857	I would take the fight to these guys, whatever it took, as long as it took.
0.0	0.387612110831	Middle class may notice it when they get to the cash register.
0.0	0.641257719246	And what we said is, if they're going to impose this on us, we better prepare to protect the state from it.
0.0	0.632667135813	Somebody who is very fond of the president, agrees with him most of the time, I disagree with his recent deportation policies.
0.0	0.55752376991	Well, thank you very much for hosting this debate, and let me applaud my colleagues up here.
0.0	0.251038093895	I'm getting to that.
0.0	0.400137695851	He is the party's frontrunner right now, and good for him.

0.0	0.277345956049	Big difference.
0.0	0.537929081156	You have to deal with entitlements, you have to be in a position to control discretionary spending.
0.0	0.27536507813	Well I want to comment on this.
0.0	0.381759671227	They are -- they're in a position where they're smothering people.

0.0	0.266400089786	We were wrong.
0.0	0.681578506317	But here, a total net worth of -- net worth, not assets, not -- a net worth, after all debt, after all expenses, the greatest assets -- Trump Tower, 1290 Avenue of the Americas, Bank of America building in San Francisco, 40 Wall Street, sometimes referred to as the Trump building right opposite the New York -- many other places all over the world.

0.0	0.288513801184	Today I heard it.
0.0	0.247742396508	I have no idea.

0.0	0.485871565725	That they were going to have to hire 20,000 new IRS agencies to collect it.
0.0	0.55172200992	And there's a reason why Hillary's supporters are echoing Donald's attacks on me, because Hillary...
0.0	0.245059320121	There is a vacuum.
0.0	0.465103324776	And ISIS, make no mistake about it, is an evil in this world.

0.0	0.658917379927	Ted said he was for NSA reform, but then he told Marco Rubio, no, no, no, I voted for the bill because I'm for the government collecting 100 percent of your cell phone records.
0.0	0.465104935707	And you say to yourself, "How does that help us," right?

0.0	0.321602961728	Yeah, but the rule includes equal -- got it.
0.0	0.33910362608	It was.
0.0	0.452274667989	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.294235862807	I'm angry because our country is a mess.
0.0	0.447555745211	And we need to bring our debt under control, make our economy stronger.

1.0	0.593922560693	What Hillary Clinton's going to say, and has said before is, she wants to raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.424465821441	It's what I've done or not done, or it's war.
0.0	0.29115770601	We have people that are morally corrupt.
0.0	0.296412105677	She led that effort.

0.0	0.295543205681	One of your colleagues interviewed me.
0.0	0.274217667154	Thank you, senator.

0.0	0.669457615552	My father came to this country from Poland at the age of 17 without a nickel in his pocket, which sparked my interest in the need for immigration reform because I know what it's like to be the son of an immigrant.
0.0	0.653534817785	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.588848834244	It'll be a pretty busy day, but that Iran negotiation is going to be torn up on day one.
0.0	0.275234643845	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.665924669036	We need leadership, someone who has a backbone and sticks with things, rather than just talks about them as though anything matters when you're talking about amendments that don't even actually are part of a bill that ever passed.
0.0	0.677833492754	So, let's not in anyway imply here that either President Obama or myself, would in anyway not take on any vested interested, whether it's Wall Street, or drug companies, or insurance companies, or frankly, the gun lobby to stand up to do what's best for the American people.
0.0	0.584933788132	Under the rules, I have been -- I have been invoked, David, so let me respond very quickly.
0.0	0.245191204559	That's not fair.
0.0	0.446417088452	Number one, if they violate it, we need to move against them.
0.0	0.339602348429	Look, the threat we face from ISIS is unprecedented.
0.0	0.294105486862	You know, you look at women working.
0.0	0.676610198068	And we need to hear the voices of those men and women and boys and girls who feel like strangers in their own country and do whatever is necessary to not only deal with the immediate problems within the criminal justice system, but more opportunities, more jobs, better education so that we can begin to rebuild that very valuable asset known as trust.
0.0	0.273680403533	We have a tremendous problem.
0.0	0.427913471162	Now, I for seven years was the U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
1.0	0.543901768825	There aren't enough good-paying jobs, especially for young people.
0.0	0.291741390698	Ask Boeing.
0.0	0.489575869487	Because we have found a way to reduce hospital costs, so whenever we come...
0.0	0.341366037603	You also have to some strategically cutting in several places.
0.0	0.310193498533	I would do that to Barack Obama's executive orders.
0.0	0.405578496799	Because the more you tax something, the less of it you get.
0.0	0.430451646003	Well, Senator, look, I think we're in vigorous agreement here.
0.0	0.673383678121	And I also want to recognize the people in that church that showed the grace of God and the grace of forgiveness and the mercy that they showed.
0.0	0.654471301153	But the idea that you can't -- that you're just gonna grow your way out of this -- I have a plan to grow the economy at 4 percent, but you're gonna have to make adjustments for both Medicare and Social Security.

0.0	0.361622035059	Number two, we're going to enforce our immigration laws.
0.0	0.277908163881	Bernie Sanders is a socialist.
0.0	0.340513450378	They said they would get rid of the unconstitutional amnesty.
0.0	0.431580908539	This is a guy who just believes that law enforcement are the bad guys.
0.0	0.585947819741	No, not a comic book, and it's not a very nicely asked question the way you say that.
0.0	0.683597046763	In the 1980s, it was in Beirut, Lebanon, under President Reagan's administration, and 258 Americans, marines, embassy personnel, and others were murdered.
0.0	0.371821394718	They issue two-thirds of the credit cards and one-third of the mortgages.
0.0	0.529518541688	I know how important it is that we have a Democrat succeed President Obama in the White House.
0.0	0.265020213844	They were smarter than our leaders.
0.0	0.425923462254	And when our staffers said, "whoa, what's going here?"
0.0	0.339099852204	So, I would pass legislation outlawing abortion after 20 weeks.
0.0	0.276960282468	Hey, I have lobbyists.
0.0	0.625296372185	First off, we can do all the great speeches we want but you're not going to succeed unless there is a consensus.
0.0	0.602432146137	I look at the roads being built all over the country, and I say I can build those things for one-third.
0.0	0.587515438949	Because that person should not have gotten a gun, should not -- would not have passed a background check.
0.0	0.372272625841	Not all of his top national security advisors agreed with that.
0.0	0.399743790592	Clearly the best piece of veterans' legislation brought forth in decades.
0.0	0.476514373335	If I have a weakness, it's that I try to live by the rules.
0.0	0.335875065109	No.

0.0	0.42458127615	Iran is taking over Iraq, and they're taking it over big league.
1.0	0.684860574941	I have looked at -- I have looked at the legislation that Senator Sanders has proposed, and basically, he does eliminate the Affordable Care Act, eliminates private insurance, eliminates Medicare, eliminates Medicaid, Tricare, children's health insurance program -- puts it all together in a big program which he then hands over to the states to administer.
0.0	0.342237388885	And they don't buy their guns from a gun store.
0.0	0.275911992263	I'd like to jump in.
0.0	0.670360911747	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you better get rid of the SuperPacs because they causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that have been made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.276204533058	I think he'd be a great spirit."

0.0	0.44925087975	And it is now being put into place everyplace across the state of Ohio.
0.0	0.460788118073	Well, that just wasn't -- that just wasn't the fact, Senator.
0.0	0.611539717307	Two of them were among the most highly decorated -- they weren't allowed on a military base to have guns.
0.0	0.679007131642	We brought together legislation supported by the American Legion, the VFW, the DOD, Vietnam Vets, all of the veterans organizations, which was comprehensive.

0.0	0.659903228676	And I give Senator Sanders a lot of credit for really lighting a fire under many people -- young, old, everybody -- who sees a chance to be involved and have their voice heard.
0.0	0.238871216963	Thank you.
0.0	0.609365433261	Obviously, Mrs. Obama has been a terrific leader when it comes to young people's health, particularly nutrition and exercise.

0.0	0.292006641463	We're going to cut costs.
0.0	0.297317988274	But I would say this to you, Bret.
0.0	0.490677829096	And as Reagan demonstrated, if we cut taxes, we can bring back growth.
0.0	0.6704928899	And second, the First Amendment Defense Act, which is protecting religious liberty, if it's not passed by then, which I suspect it won't, because the president will veto it, I will institute an executive order to make sure that people of faith are not being -- not being harassed and persecuted by the federal government for standing up for the religious beliefs.
0.0	0.670547518005	What I said, and let me repeat it, I don't know what economists Secretary Clinton is talking to, but what I have said, and let me repeat it, that yes, the middle -- the family right in the middle of the economy would pay $500 dollars more in taxes, and get a reduction in their healthcare costs of $5,000 dollars.

0.0	0.321662837849	How about Obamacare, a certified job killer?
0.0	0.257389685203	I love China.
0.0	0.259141519604	I was a banker and I was proud of it.
0.0	0.467197546555	And that's why Monday night, what will happen here in Iowa is so important.
0.0	0.312486704334	... and we will end the illegal immigration.
0.0	0.673262382031	So, I think it's important for us to be careful about the language we use, which is why I've been critical of Donald Trump.
0.0	0.300009557705	One thing I want to be clear about tonight.
0.0	0.587738893516	Let me concur with the secretary, no question women's rights are under fierce attack all over this country.
0.0	0.277812263597	This is a bad deal.
1.0	0.688936310271	According to the statistics that I'm familiar with, a black male baby born today stands a one in four chance of ending up in the criminal justice system.
0.0	0.687875653616	To tell Qatar, that instead of spending $200 billion on the World Cup, maybe they should pay attention to ISIS, which is at their doorstep.
1.0	0.714359544773	He put a 25 million dollar check up from his own pocket to fund that campaign and my wife Heidi and I, we ended up investing everything we owned.
0.0	0.652246420859	But let me just say that we also need down -- to tear down the cyber walls that China is erecting, that Russia is erecting.
0.0	0.283847977695	You're seeing cities like Seattle.
0.0	0.671073057334	If we were to expand Medicaid, for every uninsured person we would cover, we'd kick more than one person out of private insurance or remove their opportunity to get private insurance.
0.0	0.440233844302	They are anxious about international terrorism and the possibility of another attack on America.
0.0	0.334177198082	Let me put those proposals-- and you're absolutely right.
0.0	0.518637723952	Let me tell you who's not qualified to be President of the United States, Chris.
0.0	0.269958665202	Neil...
0.0	0.406579689588	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.595963522937	We've all been talking about tax reforms tonight, and paying for infrastructure is caught right up in tax reform.
0.0	0.285419451665	They've got nothing but money.
0.0	0.596967596357	And I do believe, and I would disagree somewhat with one of my colleagues, this is a genocidal threat.
0.0	0.268245077665	OK.
0.0	0.668697974572	Every (inaudible) Democrat and senator in support of this proposal introduced by your good friend and my good friend, Kirsten Gillibrand, Rosa DeLauro, got ears (ph) to legislation out there that will finally provide family and medical leave.
0.0	0.292144258599	I would put it in a blind trust.
0.0	0.610270312774	Now, what the magic number is, I don't know, because we don't know the extent of the problem.
0.0	0.320736876359	So we need people -- I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.432540674938	Let me agree with much of what the secretary and the governor have said.
0.0	0.674859188284	When he brought forward the "Gang of Eight" bill to give citizenship to those who came here illegally, I put forward an amendment that says we should have more scrutiny on those who are coming as students, those who are coming as immigrants, those who are coming as refugees, because we had two refugees come to my town in Bowling Green and try to attack us.
0.0	0.650615786811	In all due respect, Secretary Clinton, a lot of the progressive groups, the online groups have really asked you a simple question.
0.0	0.687324387807	You know, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took the oath of office in 1933 at a time when 25 percent of the American people were unemployed, country was in incredible despair.
0.0	0.595725616458	What we are talking about in reality is a corrupt campaign finance system, that's what we're talking about.
1.0	0.270796909146	It was below zero.
0.0	0.659853120983	Here's my promise, at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country.
0.0	0.424604271653	I think we need to be very careful with tariffs, and here's why.
0.0	0.57804938696	And I've got to tell you, it sounded like everything in the world was going amazing, you know?
0.0	0.273216963209	They don't want them made here.
0.0	0.606379072541	We need to speak to what unites us as a people; freedom of worship, freedom of religion, freedom of expression.
0.0	0.667599229586	Not only -- not only do I apologize to Secretary Clinton -- and I hope we can work together on an independent investigation from day one -- I want to apologize to my supporters.
0.0	0.663755739196	Someone who's going to stand up, and be very clear with our enemies as to the lines their going to draw and stand with them.
0.0	0.58065551781	So we have no disagreement about the need to buttress Social Security, get more revenue into the program.
0.0	0.277554302175	They had a plan that was good.
0.0	0.279005863161	We've got to hate the Muslims."
0.0	0.664110685634	We cannot fix things in this country -- the Social Security, the border, balancing the budget, getting wages to grow faster -- unless we lead as conservatives, but we also invite people in from the other party.
0.0	0.276943979025	Right.
0.0	0.586908810325	So I don't know if you would call that a weakness, but my wife said "let up."
0.0	0.619441972149	And his explanation -- he said, "look, I'm from New York, that's what we believe in New York.
0.0	0.687655441396	Just as we require every major department, every county to report its major crimes, we should require police departments to report their discourtesy, brutality, excessive force.
0.0	0.26298287365	Your question was you have disagreed...
0.0	0.686330203072	Yes, does Wall Street and big financial interests, along with drug companies, insurance companies, big oil, all of it, have too much influence?
0.0	0.674916048309	And the bottom line is this, we are not going to be able to do anything on this issue until we first bring illegal immigration under control.
0.0	0.675719344124	In the 21st century, it has to be more of a merit-based system, and that is why our legal immigration system is in need of modernization.
0.0	0.334170379415	They are employing themselves, they are potentially employing others.
0.0	0.664590982801	But, what we did is we said to the working families of this country, look, we know things are tough, but if you want to help us go beyond establishment politics, and establishment economics, send us something.
0.0	0.679585411863	I do believe that people who are trying to come to the United States -- this country has a right to know who they are and why they are coming.
0.0	0.659801386444	So, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities.
0.0	0.295488596222	That sounds like a long time ago.
0.0	0.473316056703	And the problem, Maria, is that the military is not ready, either.
0.0	0.388729833845	And Bill said, "No, no, she hasn't."
0.0	0.674090750975	So there's a lot of work we need to do and I want to be sure what's called the AUMF, has the authority that is needed going forward.
0.0	0.684284173823	We had an audit-the-Fed vote, which was the biggest thing my dad had been advocating for, for 30 years, Ted didn't have time to show up.
0.0	0.353796589971	And to contrast, even -- there are differences among us.
0.0	0.259357341696	But I learned a lot.
0.0	0.487133474676	So, let's stop fooling around about this, let's tell people the truth.
0.0	0.658493726603	Millions of people are going to have to stand up, turn off the TV, get involved in the political process and tell the big- money interest that we are taking back our country.
0.0	0.238871216963	Thank you.
0.0	0.553486844627	That's why I've entered this race, and I think I have the experience to do it.
0.0	0.664738040726	But, I said, "This is going to be an election that's based on competence, because people are tired of these nice people.
0.0	0.662437398188	You can trust me to do the following: that when I get on change with Hillary Clinton, we won't be debating about the science, we'll be debating about the solutions.
0.0	0.244993353766	... Chris, your questions that you...
0.0	0.608196577836	If we don't know who you are, or why you're coming, you will not get into the United States.
0.0	0.679474025897	As a governor we actually made the greater investments so that we could go four years in a row without a penny's increase to college tuition.
0.0	0.684562735271	Second of all, and the reason I believe in a health care for all program, we need to understand that addiction is a disease, not a criminal activity.
0.0	0.30081653429	We must able to work collaboratively with others.
0.0	0.673008633239	Just like Martin, I met with a group of Muslim-Americans this past week to hear from them about what they're doing to try to stop radicalization.
0.0	0.238871216963	Thank you.
0.0	0.659433628208	I want to end the international embarrassment of the United States of America being the only major country on earth that doesn't guarantee health care to all people as a right, not a privilege.
0.0	0.252007322813	Megyn, that's the problem.
0.0	0.464503849713	John, I -- if I -- a lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.58119240627	In fact, one of her first acts as president may very well be to pardon herself because Hillary Clinton...
0.0	0.601443414882	The fact of the matter is we're not going to have peace -- we are not going to have peace in Syria.
0.0	0.341190412426	Bill after coming home from Japan, flying 33 missions.
0.0	0.266962961707	That's right.
0.0	0.530050239466	Well, (inaudible) the major issue right now is whether or not we reestablish Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.539653537349	And, you know, China comes over and they dump all their stuff, and I buy it.
0.0	0.359542135158	People say, "Oh, you don't like China?"
0.0	0.265118217199	You want me to answer that question?
0.0	0.47861806414	There's not going to be consensus on this issue until we enforce our immigration laws.
0.0	0.462620794553	They've been talking about this issue for 30 years, and nothing ever happens.
0.0	0.302915003423	This is an incredibly complicated region of the world.
0.0	0.328351787741	We were the first to pass a minimum wage.
0.0	0.673012168792	And that's why I've been clear, when I am the president of the United States of America, we don't know who you are, and we don't know why you're trying to come to the United States, you are not going to get in, because the radical threat that we now face from ISIS is extraordinary and unprecedented...
0.0	0.298538695443	A friend of mine is a great manufacturer.
0.0	0.526340119122	That's not some sort of passe you know, antique sort of principle that safeguards our freedoms.
0.0	0.635683266148	I have seen him appoint people to our courts not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.598186395561	And then, most importantly, here at home, I think there are three things that we have to get right.
0.0	0.477798638555	And just to finish, people say, how will you get Mexico to pay?
0.0	0.447213882228	And they wonder whether somebody is getting something to -- keeping them from getting it.
0.0	0.318706770302	Too often, they give up, they negotiate with themselves.
0.0	0.291479220346	We talked about criminal justice reform.
0.0	0.384261088069	ISIS is the most dangerous jihadist group in the history of mankind.
0.0	0.448792795937	Oh, well, you know, it just didn't work out for you.
0.0	0.276366106596	Yes.
0.0	0.669275966892	In fact, if more border security and these -- and more and more deportations were going to bring our Republican brothers and sisters to the table, it would have happened long ago.
0.0	0.462059905443	Well, first of all, I'm 7 and 0 in my fantasy league.
0.0	0.644443529151	For too long -- no, for too long, what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our people's jobs, and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us.
0.0	0.421417200564	And together, we can solve these problems that hurt us and heal America.
0.0	0.271555763563	Well, I -- if I might.
0.0	0.283574923658	Ever.
0.0	0.630956355082	So actually, the opportunity is there, because of the threat to all of these countries, to bring all of us together...
0.0	0.659058010966	Where did it ever say in the Constitution, where is it written that it's the job of the United States of America or its secretary of State to determine when dictators have to go?
0.0	0.581183406482	And I believe people need a leader who is prepared to make tough calls in tough times and stand up...
0.0	0.682391345815	Let me tell you something, when you see thousands upon thousands upon thousands of children being murdered in the womb, I can't think of anything better than that.
0.0	0.663933602749	Everybody said it was going to be three hours, three and a half, including them, and in about two minutes I renegotiated it so we can get the hell out of here.
0.0	0.358751366687	You just have to look today at Indonesia, bombings all over.
0.0	0.328436419667	The troops on the ground should not be American troops.
0.0	0.534936469971	So, you know, again, the difference between us and the Republicans is night and day.
0.0	0.256763424741	I changed that.
0.0	0.352563934251	We don't need to raise taxes to get this done.
0.0	0.308240411632	And we ought to fight them on that level.
0.0	0.295633711469	Please become part of the political revolution.
0.0	0.266261072711	He wasn't my senator.
0.0	0.180782917891	That's the negotiator we have.
0.0	0.33332521023	If that's a blind trust, I don't know.
0.0	0.665670022468	It would bring the money back into the United States to help build jobs by American companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about.
0.0	0.263952376843	I don't care.
0.0	0.688576191057	What I would like for the media now is for us to be talking about why the middle class is disappearing, why we have more people in jail than any other country, why we have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, and we're the only major country on Earth without paid family and medical leave.
0.0	0.24674226207	They don't have a clue.
0.0	0.593508718006	And maybe the back door is the wrong door, and I understand what Apple and others are saying about that.
0.0	0.294790372785	We bailed out Wall Street.
0.0	0.661895393718	If we want to create jobs for the folks that you're talking about, who are having trouble getting off government benefits, primarily because of their low skill level, there is no better way -- it's worked for 100 years in America -- putting people back to work in manufacturing is it.
0.0	0.402555782017	We have talked about tax reform in every single election for decades.
0.0	0.265456074339	And we have nothing.
0.0	0.651109639294	If you're not willing to do that, nobody wants to do it, but if you're not willing to gradually raise the age, you're not serious about fixing either one of them.
0.0	0.282587594676	We now have that.
0.0	0.255478259777	We have the opposite thinking.
0.0	0.677434056779	And having been in New Hampshire and here in Iowa, but in New Hampshire, I just received the support of seven out of eight of the newspapers in that state because they see positive, they see unity, they see coming together, and they see a record of change and a record of accomplishment.
0.0	0.364515864077	It worked for Reagan and it works for our team in Ohio.
0.0	0.67778332776	Historically, it is important to try to understand your adversary in order to figure out how they are thinking, what they will be doing, how they will react.
0.0	0.285219751738	A bipartisan approach got close.
0.0	0.599604319583	We're not -- the American people -- forget about anything else, they've already been lied to and stolen from.
0.0	0.267260903096	We don't have victories anymore.
0.0	0.270098057557	What -- what -- you're from New York?
0.0	0.652865119803	I think one of the heroes in a real quagmire out there, in a dangerous and difficult world, one of the heroes who we should recognize in the Middle East is King Abdullah II of Jordan.
0.0	0.328660954951	-- the issue is who is going to get it done.
0.0	0.567505757746	But the bottom line is we must have virtue, we must have a religious bearing as a nation.
0.0	0.404796159853	If there was a -- and you know I'm not bringing a suit.
0.0	0.642603314592	I'm hoping that because of the very recent announcement of the agreement at the Security Council, which embodies actually an agreement that I negotiated back in Geneva in June of 2012, we're going to get a diplomatic effort in Syria to begin to try to make a transition.
0.0	0.278774619992	They sweated like dogs.
0.0	0.263839793565	Alright.
0.0	0.682806086944	When extraordinarily wealthy people make very large contributions to Super PACs, and in many cases in this campaign, Super PACs have raised more money than individual candidates have, OK?
0.0	0.670130345306	When he meets with the attorney general in the White House, it's not "how can we protect the Second Amendment rights of Americans."
0.0	0.259372005453	And you know what?
0.0	0.683522576689	And when FDR said, "Yeah, it is," that we're going to use all of the resources that we have to create jobs, to build homes, to feed people, to protect the farmers, we are a nation which if we come together there is nothing that we could not accomplish.
0.0	0.310185402327	But here's the point I want to make tonight.
0.0	0.28539690247	We have been talking about it for decades.
0.0	0.327354080737	That's because we've put conservative policies in place.
0.0	0.668315589803	I put together the coalition that imposed the sanctions on Iran that got us to the negotiating table to put a lid on their nuclear weapons program.
0.0	0.276395371454	But Bret, here's the problem.
0.0	0.33910362608	It was...
0.0	0.677188097641	Well, Megyn, let me say at the outset to the men and women of Iowa, thank you for the incredible hospitality over this past year.
0.0	0.652044997486	If we're willing to do what it takes now, the 21st century is going to be the new American century, greater than any other era we've had in the history of this great nation.
0.0	0.65598222878	I say, yes, not only do we give them what they need, but we don't tie their hands behind their backs so that they can go ahead and get the job done.
0.0	0.268245077665	OK.
0.0	0.292610571641	And I applaud his record in Maryland.
0.0	0.646905373544	My program would move the 104 programs of the federal Department of Education into four block grants, and send them back to the states because income inequality is driven by a lack of skills when kids don't get what they need to be able to compete and win in this country.
1.0	0.669201999739	Strong, powerful men, young and people are looking at that and they're saying what's going on?
0.0	0.29282212445	He's been a negative force.
0.0	0.29537931302	This isn't free money.
0.0	0.311028101259	We got a U.N. Security council vote.
0.0	0.267043476575	Here's the bottom line.
1.0	0.646424928684	You know, the FBI director, the president's appointed FBI director has said this week that because of a lack of support from politicians like the president of the United States, that police officers are afraid to get out of their cars; that they're afraid to enforce the law.
0.0	0.648291724405	We do that, this country would be safe and secure again not only from criminals but from the terrorist who threaten us as well.
0.0	0.669727280347	I think America can only live up to its potential when we make sure that every American has a chance to live up to his or her potential.
0.0	0.343823879484	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.445506300075	We just heard an argument back and forth that we can't solve immigration.
0.0	0.266400089786	He's wrong.
0.0	0.270432056608	But I can tell you this.
0.0	0.381481163525	So let's demand open trade but fair trade in this country.
0.0	0.270415472803	There will be a process.
0.0	0.397400381288	Martha, we offered a lot more than they were willing to take.
0.0	0.294086350527	That's not profiling, that's law enforcement.
0.0	0.270604906469	Everybody knows that.
0.0	0.681870412345	But the thing that is most important to me and caused me to run for office is I'm worried about the country and how much debt we're adding.
0.0	0.417214426699	I'm going to support you, and I think that is absolutely appropriate.
0.0	0.56659712221	We ought to be working to improve it and prevent Republicans from both underming it and even repealing it.
0.0	0.276943979025	Right.
0.0	0.408535246031	I want to do more to help incentivize and create more small businesses.
0.0	0.374916058012	The problem is, this redistribution has gone in the wrong direction.
0.0	0.585390465753	Part of the reason why it hasn't risen because sometimes we're not giving people the skills they need.

0.0	0.672992802964	Under that theory, not only would I be disqualified, Marco Rubio would be disqualified, Bobby Jindal would be disqualified and, interestingly enough, Donald J. Trump would be disqualified.
0.0	0.342482051116	It's an important one that we should be engaged in.
1.0	0.697028687532	I can tell you that adding up the fact you're not paying any private insurance, businesses are not paying any private insurance.
0.0	0.388811348847	... so you don't actually want to hear the answer, John?
0.0	0.663742335377	And with respect to my own husband, I am probably still going to pick the flowers and the china for state dinners and stuff like that.
0.0	0.552418198485	Well, first of all the -- the plan gives people the option of -- of opting out.
0.0	0.573512621915	And that's what I'll offer to the people of the United States in this candidacy for the presidency.
0.0	0.274657364538	They've got to be broken up.
0.0	0.666105672207	And you combine that with a plan to make manufacturing -- this country number one in manufacturing, you've got someone who's going to help revitalize and give hope to America, the place -- the place is that is the most hopeless today.
1.0	0.56807532003	I am tired of sending $300 billion overseas to buy oil from people who hate our guts.
0.0	0.272113969503	All right.
0.0	0.282251801427	Mark my words.
0.0	0.662467182076	We got it done in my state by leading with principal and that's what we need to do as a party for comprehensive gun safety.
0.0	0.676475469729	At that particular point in time, then Americans will believe that Washington is up to a conversation to deal with the millions of people that are here illegally, but not until.
0.0	0.283897970917	Let em also tell you...
0.0	0.666071961909	So if we're going to be talking like this, we can -- and maybe we can score some political points -- but the fact is: Every one of us stands for the kind of economy that will work better for every American.
0.0	0.301401826801	Here is where we are with public education.
0.0	0.268245077665	OK.
0.0	0.653603002357	Probably in terms of the applying for the job of president, a weakness would be not really seeing myself in that position until hundreds of thousands of people began to tell me that I needed to do it.
0.0	0.65147193395	By the way, unlike our country where we're totally predictable and the enemy, whether it's ISIS or anybody else, they know exactly what we're doing because we have the wrong leadership.
0.0	0.201936768436	I was in Burlington, Iowa.
0.0	0.436585837999	My heart has not changed, because I've always been appalled by abortion.
0.0	0.27655912725	The Europeans have moved on.
0.0	0.569819020732	Under each of those three parts of my plan, I have very specific recommendations about what to do.
0.0	0.256568402867	We are rebuilding China.
0.0	0.275362215765	Not bad.
0.0	0.270396016332	You gotta be creative and imaginative.
0.0	0.260322456497	But we stuck to our message.
0.0	0.521655878161	But you've just asked a very fundamental question about the role of faith in our country.
0.0	0.654050149918	Do not tell me that I have not shown courage in standing up to the gun people, in voting to ban assault weapons, voting for instant background checks, voting to end the gun show loop hole and now we're in a position to create a consensus in America on gun safety.
0.0	0.616136159057	We need all of them to be part of exactly what the first George Bush put together in the first Gulf War.
0.0	0.577729433979	That's how I focused from the beginning of the campaign and it is how I intend to continue going forward.
0.0	0.679197016014	So, are we going to ban Muslims from India, from Indonesia, from countries that are strong allies -- that we need to build better relationships with?
0.0	0.683165455376	So it's not just the government -- the private sector companies, it's also our own government that needs to raise the level of our game.
0.0	0.556001448051	But, of course, international terrorism is a major issue that we have got to address today.
0.0	0.521475003396	We have to go after price gouging and monopolistic practices and get Medicare the authority to negotiate.
0.0	0.610142696168	... with what Marco is saying is that it takes too long, they're sucking us dry and it takes too long.
0.0	0.673790286922	And it's important that people really look hard at what the threats and dangers we face are, and who is best prepared for dealing with them.
0.0	0.341953547211	And Secretary Clinton, unfortunately, is on the wrong side.
0.0	0.491482287976	We're spending $80 billion locking people up, disproportionately Latino and African American.
0.0	0.329659080169	Whenever they have problems, we send over the ships.
0.0	0.547126884246	I think they're more interested in what we have to say about all the big issues facing us.
0.0	0.681881968258	You know, back in September, my friend Donald said that he had had his lawyers look at this from every which way, and there was no issue there.
0.0	0.680930894556	To the 1 percent who have been fighting this war for over a decade, I'd try my best to be a commander-in-chief worthy of your sacrifice.
0.0	0.390029566859	You remember Obama a year ago, Yemen was a great victory.
0.0	0.270143423216	It's affordable for everybody.
0.0	0.2620197937	It's not fair trade.
0.0	0.284313905901	He is a good man.
0.0	0.598266906684	You just see the recent deal announced today or yesterday, more spending, more tax increasing, more regulation.
0.0	0.393978551023	And let's not let the secular progressives drive that out of us.
0.0	0.276719779735	We can do a wall.
0.0	0.282101634235	I know the bad ones.
0.0	0.271932941516	That is exactly...
0.0	0.239947288355	He's a progressive economist.
0.0	0.524353308984	Secondly, as it relates to Iran, we need to confront their ambitions across the board.
0.0	0.588124751033	I am certainly, absolutely, willing to look at that bill again and make sure there's a stronger bill.
0.0	0.492102886236	But I like to be unpredictable so that people don't know exactly... (LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.260378724044	What they do is unbelievable, how bad.
0.0	0.27984543129	They've been beaten into submission.
0.0	0.684852887694	When you have Wall Street spending $5 billion over a 10-year period to get -- to get deregulated, the only answer they know is break them up, reestablish Glass-Stegall.
0.0	0.666324998511	And you know, when you see Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and all the Democrats talking about wanting to address the plight of working women, not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama, 3.7 million women have entered poverty.
0.0	0.380252789761	We have to show that we can march to a balanced budget.
0.0	0.257150199365	And we're gonna be there very soon.
0.0	0.539535305263	The questions that are being asked shouldn't be trying to get people to tear into each other.
0.0	0.290131757037	Well, let me just say something.
0.0	0.263905753421	... but wait a minute...
0.0	0.238416915619	So I'm doing great.
0.0	0.381362309193	They recognize that people's actions don't always match their words.
0.0	0.335875065109	No.
1.0	0.446411334232	We don't need the federal government to be involved in this at all.
0.0	0.665296241376	I -- I said I made a mistake on Iraq, and I would love to see Senator Sanders join with some of my colleague in addition the Senate that I see in the audience.
0.0	0.613434658716	So this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement.
0.0	0.4272513327	Maybe we would've gotten a deal where we didn't give everything away.
0.0	0.281397617163	Can you believe this?
0.0	0.321278227216	The Egyptians have asked us to share intelligence.
0.0	0.5	Well, Neil, I'm glad we're focusing on the important topics of the evening.
0.0	0.344769128603	What should we do?
0.0	0.595551838606	And, you know, with all due respect, Senator, you voted for regime change with respect to Libya.
0.0	0.606219698626	And then we need to shut down -- we need to shut down their mechanisms of funding and attack their command-and-control centers.
0.0	0.271855144352	We're running.
0.0	0.550341885821	Washington gets bigger, taxes get higher, and the American people feel more distance from our government.
0.0	0.288317292573	That is not what America is supposed to be about.
0.0	0.663366825798	We'd rebuild infrastructure that would also create jobs in this country, and we'd work with the states to do it the right way, to do it more efficiently and more effectively.
0.0	0.405430426381	Because I don't think the American people are all that interested in this.
0.0	0.671022757938	And the U.S. chamber of commerce, which hardly ever says nice things about Democratic governors anywhere, named our state number one for innovation and entrepreneurship.
0.0	0.261077521661	You count on it.
0.0	0.315636504652	He was kind of a conservative guy in many respects.
0.0	0.598633923238	Those three things put together are going to give confidence to job creators and you will begin to see wages rise.
0.0	0.277150167701	And, the only way -- no...
0.0	0.259372005453	And you know what?
0.0	0.338130677483	It's one of the biggest problems our country has.
0.0	0.356094644519	this is a clear and present danger in our politics within.
0.0	0.260567726754	About Medicare?
0.0	0.594714636864	And sending that signal makes it impossible for us to be serious about taking out ISIS and restoring democracy in Syria.
0.0	0.610371441442	The entire system of legal immigration must now be reexamined for security first and foremost, with an eye on ISIS.
1.0	0.663424792957	And they're tired of spending more money on education than any nation in the world per capita, than any nation in the world, and we are 26th in the world, 25 countries are better than us in education.
0.0	0.366006275489	I will do everything I can as president to get that accomplished.
0.0	0.620996889059	In many ways, a college degree today is equivalent to what a high school degree was 50, 60 years ago.
0.0	0.549001753246	I think there's a sense in this country today that somehow our best days are behind us.
1.0	0.505451543865	We are relying on small campaign donors, 750,000 of them, 30 bucks a piece.
0.0	0.558945249779	They've contacted the trafficking networks in the Western Hemisphere to get people in through the southern border.
0.0	0.282846849927	Let's get rid of Assad later.
0.0	0.420233800753	It is why we have to reduce the size and power of government.
1.0	0.687509147533	I think under President Obama we have seen a lot of advances, the Affordable Care Act has helped more African Americans than any other group to get insurance, to be taken care of, but we also know a lot more than we did.
0.0	0.610308690106	It was also the disbanding of many elements of the Iraqi army that are now showing up as part of ISIS.
0.0	0.283889971999	Because now he's going a little bit better.
0.0	0.675789559376	Then, in 2008, you were portraying yourself as Annie Oakley and saying that we don't need those regulations on the federal level and now you're coming back around here.
0.0	0.567712222187	Their kids come out of college, they have high debt and they can't get a good job.
0.0	0.451061666323	Yes, I do believe there must be a tax on Wall Street speculation.
0.0	0.659747168664	That is why we have troops in Iraq that are helping to train and build back up the Iraqi military, why we have special operators in Syria working with the Kurds and Arabs, so that we can be supportive.
0.0	0.449393862624	We can use it to break up the banks, if that's appropriate.
0.0	0.281928794122	In this building, in Trump Tower.
0.0	0.477116100962	That should be a right of all Americans regardless of the income of their families.
0.0	0.66005394288	You sit down and you work with people, you make demands of people, in this case demanding Iran stop the support of international terrorism.
0.0	0.41965178162	Well, let me tell you what the country should really be worried about.
0.0	0.608759646864	They went to the vendor and said, "hey, something is wrong," and that was quietly dealt with.
0.0	0.414230511645	... you're not going to have peace in Syria with Assad in charge.
0.0	0.540612281113	Well, gee, after the last debate, I was told that I didn't smile enough.
0.0	0.63243375662	Because if your faith causes you to care for the less fortunate, it is something you want to see in your public figures.
0.0	0.284257909062	We're up 347,000 jobs.
0.0	0.587907056916	That's the book where you changed your position on immigration because you used to support a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.314389299013	I stood yesterday with 75 construction workers.
0.0	0.359088786845	And we do need China -- Donald's right about North Korea.
0.0	0.627204445985	I'm not anti-Wall Street, but I don't believe the government ought to wear a team jersey, pick winners and losers.
0.0	0.262452314898	Well, thank you.
0.0	0.26475859699	You can do both.
0.0	0.599444243108	In Louisiana, instead we're helping people getting better paying jobs so they can provide for their own health care.
0.0	0.267378609621	I'm prepared.
0.0	0.257221046108	That's fine.
0.0	0.265518269212	He got lucky with fracking.
0.0	0.683447091595	There are a lot of people living paycheck to paycheck in Florida as well, they're looking for a senator that will fight for them each and every day.
0.0	0.57551536641	So the federal solution would be the Life at Conception act which is an act that would federalize the issue.
0.0	0.287625591169	Good evening.
1.0	0.67599006852	And the worst type of concentration, Secretary Clinton, is the concentration of the big banks, the big six banks that you went to and spoke to and told them, oh, you weren't responsible for the crash, not by a long shot.
0.0	0.562637117586	Companies should, if they want to attract the best workers, provide a good set of benefits.
0.0	0.301154957379	We will arm and train the Kurds.
0.0	0.41606455101	We have to get the other 10 percent of the way to 100.
0.0	0.277214042616	... and I'd like to respond.
1.0	0.411472223281	Unfortunately, Nouri al-Maliki, the prime minister, set about decimating it.
1.0	0.677174772504	I vetoed a statewide I.D. system for gun owners and I pardoned, six out-of-state folks who came through our state and were arrested for owning a gun legally in another state so they never have to face charges.
0.0	0.412511496923	Well, Secretary Clinton, you're not in the White House yet.
0.0	0.334207277123	So with that invocation, let me say a few words.
0.0	0.372324340253	We have this enormous mismatch because we have smaller and smaller families.
0.0	0.280929870375	You get the Senate.
0.0	0.370882426104	I mean, so don't -- so you can't -- you can't...
0.0	0.298177012571	So why are the pharmaceutical companies consolidating?
1.0	0.71784257266	In fact, I think New Hampshire, in state tuition for public colleges and universities, is among the highest if not the highest in the country.
0.0	0.665223177003	They're anxious about the fact that they are working incredibly long hours, they're worried about their kids, and they're seeing all the new income and wealth -- virtually all of it -- going to the top 1 percent.
0.0	0.601144661601	What my campaign is about is a political revolution -- millions of people standing up and saying, enough is enough.
0.0	0.684405471362	And that's only the beginning of the failures that they have committed, not only in the Middle East, but all over the world, including Russia and China.
0.0	0.411396326297	And look at the results that we're still dealing with because of that.
0.0	0.682868809277	Well, you know, governor, I know that when you had a chance to appoint a commissioner for financial regulation, you chose an investment banker in 2010.
0.0	0.542796714571	It's absolutely the case that if people feel that the game is rigged, that has consequences.
0.0	0.568349732526	He's a left-wing judicial activist, Harvard Law professor who was Al Gore's lawyer in Bush versus Gore.
0.0	0.27944329864	The people aren't dumb.
0.0	0.249314034982	This stuff is fantasy.
0.0	0.274008653525	I said, "Is he intelligent?"
0.0	0.332192012281	So -- because we got to make the country rich.
0.0	0.456641833532	And it's something that can be done, and I get questioned about that.
0.0	0.270844321266	I got the briefings.
0.0	0.291230605571	You know, they want to be a little cool.
0.0	0.437317462443	You also have to get rid of all the deductions and all the loopholes.
0.0	0.287376588591	It's why you see the banks consolidating.
0.0	0.624788117027	Number two, we should expand health savings accounts so people can save in a tax-advantaged way for more routine healthcare needs.
0.0	0.274516387756	Or that we're just going to be great?
0.0	0.5	But I agree with Jeb, you can't just do this by growing the economy.
0.0	0.283389374309	And Ben, you're a terrible surgeon.
0.0	0.626411578874	When we saw the breach two months, we didn't go running to the media and make a big deal about it.
0.0	0.468548861233	And that's what i hope, there can be some understanding and cooperation to achieve.
0.0	0.39909299665	And, you know, that's been my message in New Hampshire.
0.0	0.290467011976	So, yes, I did know people.
0.0	0.416685823614	... that stage, and that is exactly what I am ready to do.
0.0	0.302595071578	How the hell can you vote for this guy?
0.0	0.618005107073	Why are there five even bigger Wall Street banks now, instead of the ten we used to have on Wall Street?
0.0	0.304135875929	That can be done without profiling people.
0.0	0.645241680161	And we are going to be able to defeat ISIS on the ground there, as well as in this world, because of the Muslim Americans in our country and throughout the world who understand that this brutal and barbaric group is perverting the name of a great world religion.
0.0	0.539948296418	And if I misrepresented those results or those projections in any way, I was held criminally liable.
0.0	0.555450961873	And the issue is, the problem is, the front pages every day were dealing with it.
1.0	0.650196758496	People are working longer hours for lower wages, and almost all of the new income and wealth goes to the top one percent.
0.0	0.645471110458	So it is possible actually, to find the things that actually work, that we did, increasing drug treatment, using big data to better protect the lives of young people, cut juvenile crime in half, and it's also possible to improve how we police our police.
0.0	0.682982296741	He used chemical weapons, he's killed, now, over a quarter of a million of his own people, and this president has done nothing.
0.0	0.620280147895	If I become President because we'll have a Constitutional Amendment to require a federally balanced budget so they will do their job.
0.0	0.304860999805	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.436618228352	I used the laws of the country to my benefit, I'm sorry.
0.0	0.354372369985	When I have to build a hotel, I pay interest.
0.0	0.454958968575	It's fine if they come in, but they have to come in legally.
0.0	0.265571461474	But not for us.
0.0	0.5	I want a government so small that the individual has a chance to thrive and prosper.
0.0	0.275640765473	Their family is waiting for them.
0.0	0.457965375866	But you know, we don't want to put everybody in the same category.
0.0	0.375247630256	And I traveled the country and learned how people made jobs.
0.0	0.293461435694	Germany, many other countries do it already.
0.0	0.271254939429	We know...
0.0	0.391545954677	He is -- this president is undermining the constitutional basis of this government.
0.0	0.592806078336	But the president needs to be laying the groundwork right now for the ability to slap those sanctions back on worldwide.
0.0	0.681367402509	I cut the bureaucracy down to size, re-introduced accountability, focused on service, on innovation, on leading in every market, in every product segment.
0.0	0.276328581576	Our rights come from God.
0.0	0.646478287059	I know that you now have your data back, and that there has been an agreement for an independent inquiry into what did happen.
0.0	0.277150167701	And that's the way it is.
0.0	0.300815894791	Look, the -- the deal is already done.

0.0	0.2987062226	I would like to start with a basic.

0.0	0.287423284127	People that know me, like me.
0.0	0.683506623675	With respect to the United States, I think our role in NATO, our support for the E.U., as well as our willingness to take refugees so long as they are thoroughly vetted and that we have confidence from intelligence and other sources that they can come to our country, we should be doing our part.
0.0	0.489300222066	Hillary Clinton has never been responsible for those kind of decisions where they were held accountable.
1.0	0.487016135488	It didn't say a word about legalization.
0.0	0.259375527453	That's what we believe in.
0.0	0.683595263614	Yeah, but that -- because the math is, if you -- 5 percent of a million is a lot more than 5 percent of a thousand.
0.0	0.632225536919	I'm not going to cut it at all; I'm going to bring money in, and we're going to save it.

0.0	0.276755608997	Let's talk about our campaigns.
0.0	0.688491685178	If you don't have talented people, if you don't have great leadership, if you don't have people that know business, not just a political hack that got the job because he made a contribution to a campaign, which is the way all jobs, just about, are gotten, free trade terrible.
0.0	0.302823844623	The final observation, invoked Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.584991267812	I want to find out -- many people saw pipe bombs and all sorts of things all over their apartment.

0.0	0.287828062644	He's penalized -- and doesn't understand.
0.0	0.278085696065	It's great to be at Trump Tower.
0.0	0.340792950364	Border security has always been a part of that debate.
0.0	0.377177133483	That's fair game but that's where I'm going to focus.
0.0	0.255973828276	... and I'll tell you why.
0.0	0.258020199531	When I was 21, my mom died.
0.0	0.26959290553	My point is this.
0.0	0.284390060315	... Actually, I was...
0.0	0.557693496257	Now, what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next.
0.0	0.279430677847	You learn that threats always change.
0.0	0.31211177712	You know, let me say something at the outset.
0.0	0.67544452407	And when countries violate trade agreements or dump product in this country, we need -- we need to stand up against those countries that do that without making them into an enemy.
0.0	0.534813006843	You've got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.591329278228	Because we have to stop doing things for some people, but for this country, it's destroying our country.
0.0	0.633561683876	You know, whatever your issue, your cause, the festering problem you hoped would resolved, the political class has failed you.
0.0	0.270247636738	It's a hard problem.
0.0	0.250749216086	It's not about Donald Trump.
0.0	0.32051945798	It's called the value added tax.
0.0	0.308722446803	He's actually a negative force.
0.0	0.426243917551	But think of it, GDP below zero, horrible labor participation rate.
0.0	0.427323385901	And I agree with much of what the secretary and the governor have said.
0.0	0.275524547075	But she did say there was anger.
0.0	0.241173109157	...Chris...
0.0	0.354316498722	Rand's amendment was not the right way to do it.
0.0	0.284407923935	This is the first priority.
0.0	0.662876169967	I think now what I've called for is counsel for every child so that no child has to face any kind of process without someone who speaks and advocates for that child so that the right decision hopefully can be made.
0.0	0.619661025407	As a nation, we have to embrace this moment and make our departments more open, more transparent, and more accountable.
0.0	0.247159537099	Appreciate it.
0.0	0.337770674173	I'm not that much of a socialist compared to Eisenhower.
0.0	0.658008997632	And it's why I've continued to focus on the fact that we need to declare war on the four big cost drivers because 80 percent of all medical costs in this country are chronic disease.
0.0	0.67328653982	And that's why I think these ideas up here are great, and that's what we should have is have more discussions like this and less gotcha.
0.0	0.335548128085	Look, it takes three things basically to grow jobs.
0.0	0.647008570047	Just the other day, Russia allowed a television camera to see the plans for a drone submarine that could carry a tactical nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.270700512733	This is beyond anybody's expectations.
0.0	0.375987540826	Now, you can support one now that's very low.
0.0	0.27781870945	You don't want to hear the answer.
0.0	0.6709340904	That is why I'm going to have a tax on Wall Street speculation to make certain that public colleges and universities in America are tuition free.
0.0	0.257389685203	I love China.
0.0	0.432437983362	It's actually evidence of the bias that exists in the American media today.
0.0	0.429892011392	When you head back to airport tonight, go check and see what the...
0.0	0.687950057473	It seems to me that given our history as a nation that has been a beacon of hope for the oppressed, for the downtrodden, that I very strongly disagree with those Republican candidates who say, you know what, we've got to turn our backs on women and children who left their home with nothing, nothing at all.
0.0	0.255894145908	Yeah.
0.0	0.646395140126	In my own state, after the children in that Connecticut classroom were gunned down, we passed comprehensive gun safety legislation with background checks, ban on assault weapons, and Senator, I think we do need to repeal that immunity that you granted to the gun industry.
0.0	0.645992633732	Why, for the life of me, I do not understand why did we stop doing vocational education in America, people that can work with their hands; people you can train to do this work while they're still in high school so they can graduate ready to go work.
0.0	0.689660898144	It is imposed on business and a critical piece that Marco seems to be missing is that this 16 percent business flat tax enables us to eliminate the corporate income tax.
0.0	0.604740459202	They're looking -- they're looking to manipulate our -- the visa waiver countries to get people into the United States.
0.0	0.607383217448	... in addition to that, we go ahead and we take the oil from them, their source of revenue.
0.0	0.309421451975	The administration originally said 10.
0.0	0.328691903679	You gotta be -- stick with it, and all that.
0.0	0.422040686737	So count me in as somebody who will not be listening to Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.644623047639	These are American soldiers and we fail them when we fail to take into account what happens the day after a dictator falls and when we fail to act with a whole of government approach with sustainable development, diplomacy, and our economic power in alignment with our principles.
0.0	0.444209363078	So, you know, we'll take our progress wherever we can find it.
0.0	0.546871669092	I feel like I need -- I feel like I need a Washington to English dictionary converter, right?
0.0	0.459081000024	And yes, the economy is rigged in favor of those at the top.
0.0	0.276786505398	This is a war for the soul of Islam.
0.0	0.661494857547	The issue is -- I believe, and I believe this honestly, and I don't know that there's much difference on guns between us.
0.0	0.671961084305	Lawrence Tribe and (inaudible) from Harvard -- of Harvard, said that there is a serious question as to whether or not Ted can do this.
0.0	0.651987934537	And Mexico's going to pay for the wall because Mexico -- I love the Mexican people; I respect the Mexican leaders -- but the leaders are much sharper, smarter and more cunning than our leaders.
0.0	0.280314457221	Quite likely, for that reason.
0.0	0.277174419211	You can go to my website...
0.0	0.259400331774	That's crony capitalism.
0.0	0.652348366059	If you're running for president of the United States and you do not understand that we cannot defend this nation without more of our soldiers over there, you are not ready for this job.
0.0	0.585079799717	I just don't believe that this country's days are going to be deeply -- you know, going down.
0.0	0.259164485216	I gotta do it, Dad.
0.0	0.333022383621	...
0.0	0.490023056402	Not only were we the first state in the nation to pass a living wage.
0.0	0.212674493452	And we do have a role in this.
0.0	0.505192697225	Right now, you don't have the -- you have taxes that are too high.
0.0	0.33910362608	It is.
0.0	0.614555687419	Let me do that but let me pick up on an issue, a very important issue that we have not yet discussed.
0.0	0.647013468822	The federal government can play a role in allowing them to do that, but they should not -- the process of statehood or the status of Puerto Rico won't be solved until we get to the bigger issue of how you deal with the structural economic problems they're facing right now.
0.0	0.232294594259	He's very charming.
0.0	0.680165039367	I believe we should focus on middle-class families, working families, and poor kids who have the ambition and the talent to go to college and get ahead.
0.0	0.296733051796	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.523587519802	People in Washington think they were sent there to be adults and govern and do all this.
0.0	0.452308097566	Your proposal is to go and send the health care system to the state.
0.0	0.672796786819	And then on top of that, we've got a corrupt campaign finance system in which millionaires and billionaires are pouring huge sums of money into super PACS heavily influencing the political process.
0.0	0.622791548644	In her world, cap- and-trade would dominate, that we will destroy the economy in the name of helping the environment.
0.0	0.286250383613	I couldn't have said it better myself.
0.0	0.653636495243	I mean, we've seen time and time again, especially in this very troubled region of nation-state failures, and then we have no idea who the next generation of leaders are that are coming forward.
0.0	0.66060369378	But I believe coming from a state that has virtually no gun control, I believe that I am in position to reach out to the 60 or 70 percent of the American people who agree with us on those issues.
0.0	0.267835971982	Let me translate that for you.
0.0	0.368807238653	You will begin to see jobs created in a robust economy.
0.0	0.299914355981	Chris Christie wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.437682002497	Get the lawyers off the damn backs of the military once and for all.
0.0	0.664846361099	And I would hope, Senator Sanders, that you would join the Democrats who are trying to close the Charleston loophole, that you would sponsor or co-sponsor legislation to remove the absolute immunity.
0.0	0.279408786996	From top to bottom.
0.0	0.541630039845	And if you become the nominee, who the hell knows if you can even serve in office?
0.0	0.270969261009	This was a question on entitlements.
0.0	0.258009488998	I have a wonderful family.
0.0	0.307877710436	I mean, that's just the bottom line.
0.0	0.275623197195	Do I take the product?
0.0	0.33910362608	It is.
0.0	0.673516732257	In fact, American consumers pay the highest prices in the world for drugs that we help to be developed through the National Institute of Health and that we then tested through the FDA.
0.0	0.290896129643	Many businessmen want to endorse me.
0.0	0.683902387919	And I was proud to get the endorsement of Mayor Walsh of Boston, who has made his struggle with alcoholism a real clarion call for action in this arena.
0.0	0.286701536876	They serve in the military.
0.0	0.299536380214	Support community banks and credit unions.
0.0	0.327720785984	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the Constitution.
0.0	0.313749496835	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.264794236554	Yeah, he said everybody.
0.0	0.579566860521	Since, you know, the end of the last Clinton administration when incomes did go up for everybody.
0.0	0.607866706424	Before you get to that, though, Puerto Rico is going to have to deal with the structural problems they face.
0.0	0.358827306252	I want to speak to all our fighting men and women.
0.0	0.601175058397	Americans are tired of hearing this debate -- want to go to, what are you going to do about illegal immigration?
0.0	0.445977344204	Come on, that's just not -- you scare senior citizens with that.
0.0	0.5880272505	But there is a better way forward than either of those offered by my two opponents here on this stage.
0.0	0.518624441386	You know, when Senator Sanders talks about a coalition, I agree with him about that.
0.0	0.253825621564	Whoa.
0.0	0.533525630112	If we are going to be competitive in the global economy we need the best educated workforce.
1.0	0.633326513908	Now, on the floor of the Congress, the Washington establishment from both parties puts forward a bill that will explode the deficit.
0.0	0.369176782012	Our decision is, then, do we give them what we need.
0.0	0.63211792858	We have to protect our 2nd amendment and you cannot do this and certainly what Barack Obama was doing with the executive order.
0.0	0.646262005977	I was on morning Joe at a town hall and a young student stood up and said, "Can I still be idealistic?"
0.0	0.667115599778	But bottom line now, is in America, in the year 2015, any person who has the ability and the desire should be able to get an education, college education, regardless of the income of his or her family.
0.0	0.363417516619	What else we can do is that we should believe in science.
0.0	0.304989102265	That's why I've got such a good plan.
0.0	0.596964567678	And I will also go after executives who are responsible for the decisions that have such bad consequences for our country.
0.0	0.267647057933	We're laughed at all over the world.
0.0	0.461669194369	I did it as the chairman of the Budget Committee, working with Senator Domenici.
0.0	0.319880452031	I could only get two Republican votes on that.
0.0	0.277432507094	It certainly does cover it.
0.0	0.426168307016	But for that Texas police officer, we could have had a mass murder.
0.0	0.357075730034	We have to get back into looking at what's causing it.
0.0	0.522970581384	But -- but we are going to end the absurdity, as Warren Buffet often remind us.
0.0	0.664157120639	We need to begin by undoing -- I would begin by undoing a whole set of things that President Obama has done, whether it's illegal amnesty or this latest round of EPA regulations.
0.0	0.311414565434	Because we shouldn't be policemen of the world.
0.0	0.675887765565	I've watched to see people say that we should dismantle Medicare and Medicaid and leave the senior citizens out -- out in the -- in the cold.
0.0	0.467339513979	... there was a question about foreign policy, by the way, and experience.
0.0	0.374255159538	That will never happen when I am president of the United States.
0.0	0.596212174085	The fact that each amendment didn't fix every problem didn't mean that I supported the rest of the bill.
0.0	0.661007375013	However, we saved 80,000 jobs and we went on to grow to 160,000 jobs, and scores of technology companies literally went out of business -- like Gateway -- taking all their jobs with them.
0.0	0.285249163275	But let me say one more thing.
0.0	0.289716961351	Make our streets safe again.
0.0	0.276334740395	And I would not support those.
0.0	0.285461397573	Of course you are right.
0.0	0.266071939629	Everybody should.
0.0	0.278877807201	She's the senator from New York.
0.0	0.493155018713	And that's an economy where ordinary Americans are working longer hours for low wagers.
0.0	0.268877547871	Not a very pleasant place to be.
0.0	0.561498123341	As we all remember, Senator Obama, when he ran against me, was against the war in Iraq.
1.0	0.670392186155	Nancy, the blueprint in Maryland that we followed was yes, we did in fact raise the sales tax by a penny and we made our public schools the best public schools in America for five years in a row with that investment.
1.0	0.552245111071	You know, not only do I have hundreds of thousands of donors, most of them small.
0.0	0.679756918192	It was the most highly sought after -- or one of them, but I think the most highly sought after project in the history of General Services.
0.0	0.671829216926	We have to end crony capitalism in Washington, where the lobbyists and the powerful can get tax breaks and tax credits, and the American people don't get laws in their interest.
0.0	0.292376868532	You've got to go the extra mile.
0.0	0.469281187614	And people said "you can't win, you can't change the culture."
0.0	0.633306793931	They're controlled fully -- they're controlled fully by the lobbyists, by the donors, and by the special interests, fully.
0.0	0.289994171379	And here's the last piece...
0.0	0.255650417126	It should always be going up.
0.0	0.670821500834	We are nineteen trillion dollars -- our country's a mess and we can't let all these people come into our country and break our borders.
0.0	0.582768983481	And that is important, because now we have a U.N. Security Council that will enable us to do that.
0.0	0.33910362608	You did.
0.0	0.286338330313	Well John, wait a minute.
0.0	0.423163061075	And it troubles me that people are rewarded for tearing down our country.
0.0	0.277205787916	How do we decide on who gets to follow up?
0.0	0.659236074425	The better way of dealing with this -- the better way of dealing with this is recognizing that there are people in, you know, the -- Islamic terrorists inside, embedded in refugee populations.
0.0	0.420228353686	When you're a governor, you're held accountable for everything you do.
0.0	0.344769128603	What do we do?
0.0	0.656245968594	We're going to be tough at the border, we're going to be tough on all of the illegal immigrants that everybody else in this field -- we're going to be different.
0.0	0.472959242268	It will cause the economy to grow, to explode, to create more jobs.
0.0	0.39233350786	He was putting his 10 and 12-year-old boys to bed the other night.
0.0	0.676208542365	This is a new era of conflict where traditional ways of huge standing armies are not as -- serve our purposes as well as special ops, better intelligence and being more proactive.
0.0	0.4521376465	As far as the wall is concerned, we're going to build a wall.
0.0	0.656644235647	You know, a minute ago, Neil asked: What has President Obama do -- done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns?
0.0	0.479634129581	But I have no argument with anyone making up her mind about who to support.
0.0	0.273403094946	A lot of interesting issues have come together.
0.0	0.665549591353	And, it was made for we the people, we are the ones who decide who we are, and we should never give away the values and principles that made America into a great nation for the sake of political correctness.
0.0	0.68439012892	If she gets elected, her first 100 days, instead of setting an agenda, she might be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse.
0.0	0.511461616577	I'm going to be introducing a plan which I call the 2020 Perfect Vision for America.
0.0	0.28705504285	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.289782792444	He invoked mine as well.
0.0	0.680555406368	So, I think we've got to understand the complexity of the world that we are facing and no place is more so than in the Middle East.
0.0	0.657323673775	But Jeb is also right that, if we just impose a tariff, they'll put reciprocal tariffs, which will hurt Iowa farmers and South Carolina producers and 20 percent of the American jobs that depend on exports.
0.0	0.289964949689	And Lehman Brothers started it all.
0.0	0.288800701436	We're running surpluses.
0.0	0.57477081741	Well, for a start it means that police officers should not be shooting unarmed people, predominantly African-Americans.
0.0	0.665066610744	And some of them, I will say, not all, have called me and said, "Donald, thank you very much; you're exposing an unbelievable problem and we have to get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.565445814318	And it's going to get worse, because remember, Obamacare really kicks in in '16, 2016.
0.0	0.395596210527	There were parts of that bill which agree with parts -- I disagree.
0.0	0.239752127937	They're off to China.
0.0	0.287199522525	We actually did it.
0.0	0.304790004485	And one more point, one more point.
0.0	0.592735003014	I want to -- before my time runs out I want to get back to this issue of ISIS versus Iran.
0.0	0.330110686758	I have a debt to America I'll never repay.
0.0	0.238871216963	Thank you.
0.0	0.653622617405	Our country rise up again, but we need to have a compelling conservative agenda that we present to the American people in a way that doesn't disparage people, that unites us around our common purpose.
0.0	0.267434755391	You have to lead.
0.0	0.445931434391	They need to be defeated militarily, and that will take overwhelming U.S. force.
1.0	0.668403686771	1.5 million jobs created during the worst economic time this country has had since the Great Depression while the rest of the country lost 400,000 jobs.
0.0	0.251509951797	I have worked for his re-election.
0.0	0.684080381805	Friends of mine are ordering Kamatsu (ph) tractors now because they've de-valued the yen to such an extent that you can't buy a Caterpillar tractor.
0.0	0.334972814501	How can you get people to vote for you?"
0.0	0.511720187808	Let me tell you what I would do immediately, day two in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.276548948596	I think that's a major accomplishment.
0.0	0.647525825068	And by the way, it's not just on immigration, you used to support TPA, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.302232561609	Karen and I have seven children.
0.0	0.543816405113	You know, we didn't start out four years ago at the top of the heap.
0.0	0.296111364507	I'll tell you how optimistic I am about America.
0.0	0.457694141162	They're not my ideas, and I don't necessarily agree with all of them.
0.0	0.245370522636	The mentally ill?
0.0	0.577535708539	92 percent -- 92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama's first term belonged to women.
0.0	0.311092009694	Reported it in the Wall Street Journal recently.
0.0	0.658429067625	So I think the better approach, the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against China economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage Barack Obama is doing to this economy.
0.0	0.658460080552	Oh yeah, we want to elect a good president, but America is great from the bottom-up, and the bottom-up is us in our families, in our communities, in our neighborhoods.
0.0	0.264479505382	We haven't done so.
0.0	0.286354867305	You've got to give people hope.
0.0	0.270172068261	And it only makes common sense.
0.0	0.59839570021	This issue now has to be about stopping ISIS entering the United States, and when I'm president we will.
0.0	0.453227275757	And those are made up of the FBI, state and local law enforcement.
0.0	0.579872845267	That's the issue that we need to tackle as Americans, and we can do it and we know how.
0.0	0.41237348635	We need a leader that wrote "The Art of the Deal."
0.0	0.279885281079	My name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.282907137718	That is what I could do for the country.
0.0	0.305377018713	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.67194609973	And unlike President Obama, where he refuses even to use the term of what's going on, he can't use the term for whatever reason.
0.0	0.304620333936	You're going away for a long, long while.
0.0	0.661974188451	I think we need major reform in the military, making it more cost effective, but also focusing on the real crisis that faces us.
0.0	0.383462287214	That's why I've been leading the fight to stop it.
0.0	0.684604627873	But when millions of people stand up and are prepared to take on the insurance companies and the drug companies, it will happen, and I will lead that effort.
0.0	0.575632507896	I just want to thank all my colleagues here for being civil, and not falling for the traps.
0.0	0.257466606156	Yes -- thank you.
0.0	0.656107089598	And a mom of a service member of ours who served two duties in Iraq said, Governor O' Malley, please, when you're with your other candidates and colleagues on stage, please don't use the term 'boots on the ground'.
0.0	0.610366555312	It's a blessing that we're living longer, so we have to increase the retirement age to reflect that blessing.
0.0	0.58764104367	First of all, I'd like to recognize Governor Haley for her incredible leadership in the aftermath of the --
0.0	0.255625941953	That's what should be done.
0.0	0.270686119048	It's not working.
0.0	0.538769488853	Well, first of all, I've seen polls where I'm beating Hillary Clinton pretty regularly.
0.0	0.664924085884	Bret, let me tell you, this is another one of those places where Hillary Clinton has so much to answer for, and why she is completely unqualified to be commander in chief.
0.0	0.257259975103	I don't know where you...
0.0	0.479146825654	My point is this: I won two landslide elections, I made big changes.
0.0	0.359649540393	And that someone in that office has to do their job.
0.0	0.271254939429	They know.
0.0	0.333177557821	I brought people together over some very deep racial divides.
0.0	0.270854517618	We don't need anything.
0.0	0.335875065109	No.
0.0	0.313846407807	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.335815199447	And strengthen our military and take care of our vets.
0.0	0.254098067307	I really am.
0.0	0.66904419698	I've heard a lot of hot rhetoric here tonight, but I've got to tell you, as somebody that actually passed a budget; that paid down a half-a-trillion dollars of our national debt, you can't do it alone.
0.0	0.294330240023	Here's my second problem.
0.0	0.282560148286	I'd like to offer a...
0.0	0.266442655828	Don't know that.
0.0	0.332168874935	... saying, no middle class tax raises.
0.0	0.610643949351	The major priority, right now, in terms of our foreign and military policy should be the destruction of ISIS.
0.0	0.248643381272	I was for legalization.
0.0	0.644705554483	And, look, I think it's important to look at what the most important counterterrorism judgment of the first four years of the Obama administration was, and that was the very difficult decision as to whether or not to advise the president to go after bin Laden.
0.0	0.294292285682	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.686750250019	I do believe that in the year 2016 we have to look in terms of public education as colleges as part of public education making public colleges and universities tuition free.
0.0	0.306693421345	They pay tax once overseas.
0.0	0.685995826636	Here's -- apart from the -- apart from the higher prices on consumers and people are living paycheck to paycheck, apart from that, there will be retaliation.
0.0	0.293928925708	They are the ones who should respond to any questions.
0.0	0.307762851399	But Saudi Arabia is in big, big trouble.
0.0	0.307136076099	Marco opposed this because they made a deal.
0.0	0.623279155524	This isn't just the country I was born in, this is the nation that literally changed the history of my family.
0.0	0.225329841565	But, here is the truth.
0.0	0.273690111028	Both served.
0.0	0.658854632992	Yes, I do believe that we must end corporate loopholes, such that major corporations year after year pay virtually zero in federal income tax, because they're stashing the money in the Cayman Islands.
0.0	0.5	(LAUGHTER) Now that we've gotten the Donald Trump portion out of the way...
0.0	0.450748744828	This is not a conflict where we send in the third divisions of Marines.
0.0	0.293193481185	And he'll say, "Please, please, please."
0.0	0.529947558759	We will invest in education, and jobs for our kids, not incarceration and more jails.
0.0	0.280466963348	Let me tell you who Larry Tribe is.
0.0	0.584531218629	We did as much as we could because the Libyans themselves had very strong feelings about what they wished to accept.
0.0	0.652120225805	And if you listen to what they say -- and I had a chance over those 11 hours to watch and listen, as well as what I see in their debates -- they are putting forth alarming plans.
1.0	0.694988819114	Gun people said, there were three candidates in the race, you vote for one of the others, but not Bernie Sanders.
1.0	0.396239546904	Mossadegh back in 1953.
0.0	0.235961754639	I'll do it.
0.0	0.35027808515	If I'm president, there won't be stupid deals anymore.
0.0	0.432775552755	Well, the role has been defined by each person who's held it.
0.0	0.460424409807	You know, John Adams famously said, "facts are are stubborn things."
0.0	0.34253670943	I propose to reverse that and get this economy moving again.
0.0	0.335875065109	Both.
0.0	0.625259634093	A politician other than the people in the states -- I don't want to -- a politician cannot get them to pay.
0.0	0.610616716899	Three times, she refused to answer the question, because she refuses to be held accountable for anything that goes wrong.
0.0	0.459510281613	If you will join me in this campaign, we will make that a mission.
0.0	0.656162249866	That's why I'm running for office because when I become president of the United States, on my first day in office we are going to repeal every single one of his unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.296772261882	You just don't make promises like this.
0.0	0.263871893052	Just a little bit.
0.0	0.612084775787	It's gonna be the best hotel in Washington, D.C. We got it from the General Services Administration in Washington.
0.0	0.216204671984	We are not France.
0.0	0.335504362408	I will tell you this, I will beat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.673523801638	So David, the conclusion of all of those things is this; they weren't hopes, they weren't dreams, they weren't amorphous goals out there.
0.0	0.673112175257	It was our money, and we brought them back to tend to the mentally ill. Because I don't think they ought to live in prison or live under a bridge; to treat the drug-addicted so they're not in an in-and-out-of- the-door policy out of the prisons; and to help the working poor so they don't live in emergency rooms.
0.0	0.581256088044	We have the Russians and the Iranians working together, not to fight ISIS, but to prop up Assad.
0.0	0.543798057199	So I know it's not going to happen overnight and everything that can be done should be done.
0.0	0.276366106596	Yes.
0.0	0.297325073082	Let me just close it out this way.
0.0	0.430398360808	Well, there are so many, I don't know where to start.
0.0	0.297479589289	Making fun of disabled people...
1.0	0.33018897106	A lot of people up there can't get jobs.
0.0	0.263583225639	Check it out.
0.0	0.259400331774	What's crony capitalism?
0.0	0.338451546719	But the facts and the law here are really quite clear.
0.0	0.272803250816	President Obama and I are friends.
0.0	0.520352606725	I have a slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially.
0.0	0.322057520749	I think he'll be a great cheerleader for the country.
0.0	0.685584511972	But accommodating 65,000 refugees in our country today, people of 320 million, is akin to making room for 6.5 more people in a baseball stadium with 32,000.
0.0	0.637037551475	And many of the fights that are going on are not ones that the United States has either started or have a role in.
0.0	0.262913819859	I think it's a two-pronged issue.
0.0	0.656003666158	We need to have a resolve that will bring the world together to root out the kind of radical jihadist ideology that motivates organizations like ISIS, a barbaric, ruthless, violent jihadist terrorist group.
0.0	0.669936525967	The caliphate of ISIS has to be destroyed, which means we need to arm directly to Kurds, imbed our troops with the Iraqi military, re engage with the Sunni tribal leaders.
0.0	0.331289433972	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.294235566376	I believe we are on the path to doing that.
0.0	0.671989388136	And so much of what we did -- to force competition, to use technology, to stand down the special interest groups -- can you imagine taking Medicaid from 10 to 2.5 percent?
0.0	0.272886233756	This is absolutely absurd.
0.0	0.557295113446	I'll bring back our jobs from China, from Mexico, from Japan, from so many places.
0.0	0.667544411085	Yeah, David, look, for crying out loud, our country has been attacked, we have pressing issues involving how we're going to adapt to this changing era of warfare.
0.0	0.629413479588	You know, in our country, there are a lot of people who feel as though they just don't have the power.
0.0	0.278481049321	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.683677365507	But our goal is, in fact, to try over a period of time to, in fact, deal with our enemies, not just ignore that reality.
0.0	0.269608830312	So, I thank you very much for that.
1.0	0.544423508403	When that war began, we had 8,000 planes.
0.0	0.303445247969	And we must work more closely with Muslim-American communities.
0.0	0.282750949657	You want to know what carpet bombing is?
0.0	0.676547489284	And then the Government steps in to try and solve the problem and we get a little further down to that progressive vision that Hillary Clinton is talking about.
0.0	0.591675467172	Donald Trump, for example -- I'm glad -- I mentioned his name again just if anybody was missing him...
0.0	0.24946018633	No accomplishment.
0.0	0.679651274618	There's too much -- it's like -- it's like take the New England Patriots and Tom Brady and have them play your high school football team.
0.0	0.5	How does that help us?  TRUMP R 15 94 1 N Where is that good?
0.0	0.329677701275	$1 billion a day.
0.0	0.681817775958	But there wasn't a single day as mayor of Baltimore that I wasn't asked whether I was delivering on the promise I made to police the police.
0.0	0.310787144953	That's when we become a country that's unsalvageable.
0.0	0.670789279725	And now what we have is a whole stretch now, of the coast of Libya, 100 miles, 150 miles, that has now become potentially the next safe haven for ISIL.
0.0	0.337775158233	ISIL is trying to create themselves into a new state.
0.0	0.316830167631	He said, "I can't get it into China.
0.0	0.310438341738	I want to ask the people of the audience.
0.0	0.308276959054	We ought to send used equipment, right?
0.0	0.285066108291	I very much appreciate that comment, Bernie.
0.0	0.301830918012	I support NAFTA.
0.0	0.269622365955	That's what I think we need to do.
0.0	0.66598029616	As far as the polls are concerned, Iowa, on Monday night you're going to go to a caucus site and you'll be the first Americans that vote in this election.
0.0	0.60123303732	Now, our country needs -- our country needs a truly great leader, and we need a truly great leader now.
0.0	0.291995035188	I never said that.
0.0	0.263601969579	That is what I believe.
0.0	0.607542214188	Now that applies universally to giant corporations that with lobbyists right now are not paying taxes, and as small business.
0.0	0.267597958342	But I went further than that.
0.0	0.663452199223	One of the problems we have had -- I think all Americans understand this, is whether it's Republican administrations or Democratic administrations, we have seen Wall Street and Goldman Sachs dominate administrations.
0.0	0.648632851335	We need to make sure that people understand, as Jeb said before, that if you've done extraordinarily well in this country, do you want them to take more out of your taxes now and think they're gonna give it back to you later?
0.0	0.652645789356	And I will be laying out in detail, what I think we need to do with our friends and allies in Europe and elsewhere to do a better job of coordinating efforts against the scourge of terrorism.
0.0	0.295453788126	None of that information was looked at.
0.0	0.298768749523	That is our government today.
0.0	0.455223615729	We have all the cards, but we don't know how to use them.
0.0	0.267897584619	And I apologize to nobody for that.
0.0	0.548132158555	... First of all -- Let me go first, and then you can please recognize Rand after.
0.0	0.602367568784	And this big powerful, corrupt bureaucracy works now only for the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected.
0.0	0.29870070392	They do not get any credit for their care-taking responsibilities.
0.0	0.590721520169	But today, we're the only nation on the planet that's saddling our kids with a lifetime of bills.
0.0	0.306406172615	My state is doing great across the board.
0.0	0.641430091351	I spent a lot of time in the situation room as secretary of state and there were many very difficult choices presented to us.
1.0	0.464798805388	And Iranian wise guys having guns to their heads.
0.0	0.25905916796	I'm too agreeable, easy going.
0.0	0.615910815808	Whose fault is it that Medicare is broken, out of money, that Social Security is broken, out of money?
0.0	0.398280362603	I think -- I'm not going to say that everybody is in agreement.
1.0	0.710831700747	When I ran in 1999, David, for mayor of Baltimore, our city by that year had become the most addicted, violent, and abandoned in America.
0.0	0.687757443183	And I think that the record of the governor of the last 14 years of the 12th largest economy in the world is just the medicine America is looking for.
0.0	0.546404543573	I think it's important for people in elected office to try to forge consensus to solve problems.
0.0	0.655884485549	My four children have been able to receive a good Christian education, and I've been able to save for them to go to college so they never have to have the loans that I did.
0.0	0.270951843167	They go to Harvard.
0.0	0.530731531879	Well, I think there are some differences of opinion here, perhaps between the secretary and myself.
0.0	0.314601804073	Meantime, wages have stagnated for 40 years.
0.0	0.287680584257	I would just say that...
0.0	0.388826969094	And we have to lead, if we're going to be successful.
0.0	0.27289686369	Bipartisan issue.
0.0	0.441211428726	Now, when it mattered, he stood up and took on Wall Street.
0.0	0.623157083492	And I'll tell you who supported my amendment -- Jeff Sessions, the strongest opponent of amnesty in the United States Congress.
0.0	0.674672609505	And right now, I will be putting up a tremendous -- so far, I've put up less than anybody and I have the best results.
0.0	0.268472843109	This is a complicated issue.
0.0	0.673284900214	Well, I'm sorry that whoever tweeted that had that impression because I worked closely with New Yorkers after 9/11 for my entire first term to rebuild.
0.0	0.604085563307	There is so much wealth out there that can make our country so rich again, and therefore make it great again.
0.0	0.564866377049	And this is beanbag compared to what the Clinton hit machine is going to do to the Republican nominee.
0.0	0.479606384986	We don't have a health care crisis in America, we have a health crisis.
0.0	0.659932159465	The fact of the matter is, the more our people earn, the more money they spend, and the more our whole economy grows.
0.0	0.582734425728	And -- and -- you know, it goes back to the whole concept of regulations, which are in everything.
0.0	0.278356229397	We can build the fence.
0.0	0.351170168166	You know, I see a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist.
0.0	0.275242489808	They've advertised that.
0.0	0.665486484408	Look, I am deeply concerned about what's happening in every community in America, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths.
0.0	0.643006283195	Not committing crimes and earn legal status where you're not cutting in front of the line for people that are patiently waiting outside.
0.0	0.520929453217	And we must substantially lower, as my legislation does, interest rates on student debt.
0.0	0.676557820697	If you've got 10 people coming to your house and you know one of them is a terrorist, you're probably going to keep them all out.
0.0	0.546024475484	I think our country is tired of the politicians who simply read the polls and fail to lead.
0.0	0.441590731812	I don't -- look, I don't think anybody should be expanding Medicaid.
0.0	0.610180547208	If, heaven forbid, that next president is a Republican, I think it's pretty clear we know what will happen.
0.0	0.275100990777	-- fix America, this is the formula.
0.0	0.641118389832	I looked into the eyes of moms and dads who would do anything in their power to protect our country's values and our freedoms.
0.0	0.66966987161	We the people of the United States in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare and secure the benefits of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this constitution of the United States of America.
0.0	0.653984612233	Where the secretary and I have a very profound difference, in the last debate -- and I believe in her book -- very good book, by the way -- in her book and in this last debate, she talked about getting the approval or the support or the mentoring of Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.511912245272	She worked -- and many of us supported you -- in trying to rebuild that devastation.
0.0	0.654912705465	You want to make the Veterans Administration do a better job, give them -- give veterans choices and you'll get a much better result.
0.0	0.255222469061	I tell you that.
0.0	0.592419003273	Look, under President Obama and Secretary Clinton, they're working hard to change the American dream into the European nightmare.
0.0	0.294687964714	I'm against anything that's bad for my mother.
0.0	0.631874876719	All through the recession, we defended the highest median income in America and the second highest median income for African American families.
0.0	0.656865748516	And in terms of seniors, there are millions of seniors -- and I've talked to them in my state of Vermont and all over this country -- who are trying to get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year Social Security.
0.0	0.670414430265	But I feel that the gun-free zones and, you know, when you say that, that's target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill. That's target.
0.0	0.263812871449	So I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.273913961	Let me...
0.0	0.273980089659	I didn't find it offensive at all.
0.0	0.328988311957	And let me tell you what the answer better not be.
0.0	0.584974895063	There has to be real tax reform, and the wealthiest and large corporations will pay when I'm president.
0.0	0.356800795727	I was one of the original sponsors of the DREAM Act.
0.0	0.574763649503	Well, let me say that I do believe that the vote on NSA made the country less safe.
0.0	0.392057519962	They're concerned that Washington is so dysfunctional it is holding them back.
0.0	0.332685153313	So here's this -- the situation, I think, Maria.
0.0	0.279786660643	That is abundantly clear.
0.0	0.686070225601	And so he undermines the Constitution, and he undermines free enterprise by expanding government, and he betrays our allies and cuts deals with our enemies and guts our military.
0.0	0.346507506186	We defended the highest median income in the country.
0.0	0.416423877585	You know, the Security Council finally got around to adopting a resolution.
0.0	0.513532592663	We have got to demilitarize local police departments so they do not look like occupying armies.
1.0	0.644408552154	Who denies that African-American youth unemployment, real, is over 50 percent.
0.0	0.348968836965	Like rich kids, they deserve to get a free education.
0.0	0.245703274799	We bailed them out.
0.0	0.522482540611	Who actually has stood up not just to Democrats, but to leaders in our own party?
0.0	0.378035807243	-- living in extreme poverty is the highest level on record.
0.0	0.568962932046	We are trying to bring America together around an agenda that works for working families and the middle class.
0.0	0.674069012515	This is the new sort of challenge, the new sort of threat that does, in fact, require new thinking, fresh approaches and new leadership.
0.0	0.413891738429	My 750,000 donors have contributed more than a million and a half donations.
0.0	0.275519979205	Look, the secretary is right.
0.0	0.687959805811	Obviously, we were distressed when we learned of it, because we have worked very hard -- I said in the beginning of this campaign, we want to reach as many voters as possible, and we have tens of thousands of volunteers doing that, and entering data all the time to keep up with what people are telling us.
0.0	0.273291444457	We saw a dictator overthrown.
0.0	0.636421481488	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.664615263976	And I think what the president has consistently said-- which I agree with-- is that we will support those who take the fight to ISIS.
0.0	0.579088309612	It shifts it to the business, and it would allow middle class people to get a tax cut.
0.0	0.552054372405	What he said, and he said it in the last debate, it's simply not true.
0.0	0.461350423341	And somebody like a Trump comes along and says, "I know the answers.
0.0	0.328748909732	Reforms, everything from moral and cultural issues to economic issues.
0.0	0.6454750826	Look, the -- the simple fact is that my plan actually gives the middle class the greatest break: $2,000 per family.
0.0	0.52968582081	So, I represented New York, and I represented New York on 9/11 when we were attacked.
0.0	0.314348388085	Now, let me just be clear, John.
0.0	0.5	Universal national service is an option for every kid in America to cut youth employment.
1.0	0.68652118579	I think it's fair to say, Assad has killed, by last count, about 250,000 Syrians.
0.0	0.630667200324	You know, it is difficult finding intelligence that is actionable in a lot of these places, but we have to keep trying.
0.0	0.335875065109	But...
0.0	0.590533417743	That's the establishment telling us to hide our conservative principles to get the left and the media to like us.
0.0	0.315637819351	So the crisis was I lost what I wanted.
0.0	0.646975798017	John, I don't think that there is a crisis at the state or local level that really you can point to and say, therefore, I am prepared for the sort of crises that any man or woman who is commander in chief of our country has to deal with.
0.0	0.640272330203	And secondly, when you talk about me being on the board of Lehman Brothers, I wasn't on the board of Lehman Brothers.
0.0	0.669768614272	Had that actually -- that same columnist wrote a column comparing me to an evil demonic spirit from the move, "It Follows" that jumps apparently from body to body possessing people.
0.0	0.319024854022	When people ask me, whose fault is it?
0.0	0.277066906744	They want to trigger an apocalyptic Armageddon showdown.
0.0	0.685118357419	And remember this -- I'm credible on this for this reason: Americans for Tax Reform says that I've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history.
0.0	0.645518069061	I think America is just a few good decisions and a leadership change at the top away from the best years we've ever had.
0.0	0.23767331867	Look what we did in Iran with Mosaddegh.
0.0	0.307522642633	No Wall Street executive has been prosecuted.
0.0	0.653641393509	Martha, that -- you know, one of the reasons why I have advocated for a no-fly zone is in order to create those safe refuges within Syria, to try to protect people on the ground both from Assad's forces, who are continuing to drop barrel bombs, and from ISIS.
0.0	0.597082318039	John, I had the honor of being chairman of the U.S. Senate committee on Veterans' Affairs for two years.
0.0	0.223888142409	There's -- look, there's --
0.0	0.26874732669	That is why we need to make...
0.0	0.424457834392	We have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone.
0.0	0.288804348677	The most mistreated people.
0.0	0.276701458859	Folks, we've got to wake up.
0.0	0.577643076591	They should be able to walk in the door tomorrow and get a variety of treatments that work for them.
0.0	0.344564470183	She put American intelligence officers at risk for her convenience.
0.0	0.280741576671	... ground and air.
0.0	0.238871216963	Thank you.
0.0	0.340063650306	We're soon going to be at $20 trillion.
0.0	0.511287390437	There are too many opioids being prescribed, and that leads directly now to heroin addiction.
0.0	0.266365453757	(LAUGHTER) I'll tell you what.
0.0	0.398217405646	I have a plan that I've put forward to go after ISIS.
0.0	0.348526507573	And not only did I fight them, but I beat them.
0.0	0.22310700769	And that's what I intend to do.
0.0	0.482184050505	That's what I've done in Louisiana, that's what I'll do in America.
0.0	0.48275017654	The increasing globalization without any real safety valve for people to have a better life.
0.0	0.681997265001	Why is it that the United States of America today is the only major country on earth that does not guarantee health care to all people as a right?
0.0	0.355800902097	I think the issue here is -- and I applaud Secretary Clinton.
0.0	0.671385897962	I'm tired of seeing what's going on, between the border where the people flow over; people come in; they live; they shoot.
0.0	0.65541467496	Suicide, alcoholism, drugs, that's why we need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country, and not just a handful of billionaires who have enormous economic and political power.
0.0	0.537255879368	So you know the New York Times and I don't have exactly have the warmest of relationships.
0.0	0.69027587168	I have a concrete plan to do just that, which allows people to keep HSAs to encourage savings, it allows for people that are retiring with Social Security to be able to get a minimum of 125 percent of the poverty level so that there is a baseline that in this generous country of ours no one goes below.
0.0	0.286872397223	Why didn't they call the police?
0.0	0.323120130147	Number -- and that is important for you to know.
0.0	0.599990239505	And, in my opinion, the new China, believe it or not, in terms of trade, is Mexico.
0.0	0.329837679883	... the mandates and have a simple flat tax.
0.0	0.425043429666	And when I look at Washington today, we need to bring us together.
0.0	0.240669977786	It has to be dealt with.
0.0	0.247576958173	That's really nice.
0.0	0.30457440848	Radical Muslims and radical Islam is not just hate talk.
0.0	0.54529795978	But they're going to have incentive to work, because the greatest social program is a job.
0.0	0.266962961707	That's right.
0.0	0.543181437994	We have more Americans out of work or just Americans who quit looking for work for 40 years.
0.0	0.401435997312	I think, actually, people are looking for that in Washington now.
0.0	0.589163977129	I was the chairman of the National Commission on Homeland Security and Terrorism for the United States for five years.
0.0	0.655061481709	So I put together this statement, and the only reason I'm telling you about it today is because we really do have to get going, because if we have another three or four years -- you know, we're at $8 trillion now.
0.0	0.434293925775	And what I have said is I will not throw us further into debt.
0.0	0.254449140799	How would we act?
0.0	0.453175412582	... put us on firm ground, and has sent us into the future.
1.0	0.680174334865	But two of our counties actually went to $12.80 and their county executives, if they were here tonight, would also tell you that it works.
0.0	0.666079851456	Whether it's welfare reform and getting something back for the hard-earned taxpayers; whether it's engaging in Pentagon reform and taking on the big contractors that were charging thousands of dollars for hammers and screw drivers and ripping us off; or whether it's taking on the special interests in the nursing home industry in Ohio, so that mom and dad can have the ability to stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.
0.0	0.624033875579	But we have to also go after the gun lobby and 92 percent of Americans agree we should have universal background checks.
0.0	0.652283820418	And, yes, people we may disagree with on a number of things may have some insight, may have some relationships that are important for the president to understand in order to best protect the United States.
0.0	0.286045269919	Can we stop?
0.0	0.411873146553	And I also have detailed plans to fix the mess in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.292098963061	I said, "I don't know."
0.0	0.542626303666	And the reason why this war against them is so important is that very basis of religious liberty.
0.0	0.273756012105	I have Ivanka, and Eric and Don sitting there.
0.0	0.640797874299	We rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, our roads our bridges, our rail systems, we create 13 million jobs with a trillion-dollar investment.
0.0	0.516528576509	We can reform those entitlements, we can change that corporate tax code and lower it.
0.0	0.484959156832	... the American middle class, and who are being attacked by ideologues, by demagogues.
0.0	0.578415514117	Jeb Bush says we've got to be willing to lose the primary in order to win the general.
0.0	0.275186791234	They have a responsibility, as well.
0.0	0.297598176106	Instead, the Washington establishment raised both.
0.0	0.270151049522	So I would -- I would be willing to do that.
1.0	0.678392305503	Look, I have an A plus rating in the NRA and we also have a reduction in gun violence because in Florida, if you commit a crime with a gun, you're going away.
0.0	0.614899024436	Because I don't think we should be imposing new big programs that are going to raise middle class families' taxes.
0.0	0.618283780155	Maybe that is normal politics in Washington, but that is not the politics of higher purpose that people expect from our party.
0.0	0.264339072435	You're right.
0.0	0.305760897965	It costs me $3.
0.0	0.251110512333	Mr. President, we're not against you.
0.0	0.546870127789	But at the end of the day, Wall Street today has enormous economic and political power.
0.0	0.255894145908	Yeah.
0.0	0.396851756616	And -- and I guess I can -- can frame it another way.
0.0	0.427323385901	And I agree with much of what the Secretary and the Governor have said.
0.0	0.387757745077	We've been the most pro-life state six years in a row.
0.0	0.388744879058	I guess I'm part of the establishment Barbara Bush is my mom.
0.0	0.264957759616	This guy is a petulant child.
0.0	0.423702528012	What I've always said is that this issue does need to be solved.
0.0	0.362412655281	They come from another country and they're immediately sent out.
0.0	0.418970054039	You've seen middle-class wages go backwards $3,700 during the Obama administration.
0.0	0.282066465495	I was sick and tired of Hillary Clinton's e-mail.
0.0	0.655755023511	And he stood before the American people and he said, "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself," a profound statement that gave the American people the courage to believe that, yes, we could get out of that terrible depression.
0.0	0.313206775083	You've got a bit of experience, I would imagine.
1.0	0.676917223382	Not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama and the big government economy, the median wage for women has dropped $733.
0.0	0.643857702306	Examine our records, pray on it and I will be honored if you and your family will come caucus for us on Monday night.
0.0	0.606483005291	And I think -- and I think we bring together that broad coalition, including Russia, to help us destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.25648490282	They don't like that.
0.0	0.305004046826	We need a fighter for this country again.
0.0	0.493749501266	... passed comprehensive gun safety legislation with a ban on combat assault weapons, David.
0.0	0.670586626363	CLINTON: Judy, I think that the best analysis that I've seen based on Senator Sanders plans is that it would probably increase the size of the federal government by about 40%, but what is most concerning to me is that in looking at the plans -- let's take healthcare for example.
0.0	0.259541241421	And we can do it.
0.0	0.331481233862	Fully support and back up the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.683899360567	Because of a series of disastrous trade policies which have allowed corporate America through NAFTA and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, Secretary Clinton and I disagree on those issues.
0.0	0.292169183359	Great state, great people.
1.0	0.60158494233	And may I point out that under Ronald Reagan's first term, the highest marginal rate was 70 percent.
0.0	0.659226528191	Hey, I'm in the United States Senate, and anyone who doesn't think that there is an enormous amount of waste and inefficiency and bureaucracy throughout government would be very, very mistaken.
0.0	0.66076755226	Well, in fact, I would argue that the disastrous invasion of Iraq, something that I strongly opposed, has unraveled the region completely and led to the rise of al-Qaeda and to ISIS.
0.0	0.273417895556	You know, Ted didn't show up.
0.0	0.262365151586	They're not wrong.
1.0	0.702865700147	When we have more people in jail, disproportionately African American and Latino, than China does, a communist authoritarian society four times our size.
0.0	0.260494685038	There are other racial discrepancies.
0.0	0.33688801094	But if you place good ones, you pocket it.
0.0	0.283045538201	You want to fix Medicare?
0.0	0.5	They can solve the problem of North Korea if they wanted to but they taunt us.
0.0	0.265291111454	They're not sending you.
0.0	0.314690648856	And, this is what I am finding throughout America.
0.0	0.654890932917	And we've got to get back to where people can save money again, where they can invest in their families, and I don't think a middle-class tax should be part of anybody's plan right now.
0.0	0.238871216963	Thank you.
0.0	0.682171988385	So this is the new type of threats that we're facing and we need to lead as a nation in confronting it and putting together new alliances and new coalitions.
0.0	0.651125300264	When we put money into the hands of working people, they're going to go out and buy goods, they're going to buy services and they're going to create jobs in doing that.
0.0	0.28025526815	I can promise you.
0.0	0.31681577018	... and 300,000 e-mails in my government record.
0.0	0.304130255094	And we have to take properly vetted refugees ourselves.
1.0	0.637507753382	In fact, wages adjusted for inflation haven't risen since the turn of the last century, after my husband's administration.
0.0	0.318644568922	I have said the invasion of Iraq was a mistake.
0.0	0.674453983928	I'm not -- my campaign is going to be about the future of America, it's not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage.
0.0	0.660893550412	I think THAT you can talk about Islamists who clearly are also jihadists, but I think it's not particularly helpful to make the case that Senator Sanders was just making that I agree with, that we've got to reach out to Muslim countries.
0.0	0.281173108325	I heard what they said.
0.0	0.670708205557	Now, let me ask you a question everybody, and, this is for the guy, you know, who owns a landscaping business out there.
0.0	0.656948984846	And when I'm president, I can tell you this, my faith will not just influence the way I'll govern as president, it will influence the way I live my life.
0.0	0.545247005379	It is hard to find someone in my generation that thinks Social Security will be there for us.
0.0	0.63341386445	Well, first of all, when we talk about the Import Export Bank, it's time to clean up corporate welfare.
0.0	0.656639092817	I would just say, I debated then Senator Obama numerous times on stages like this, and he was the recipient of the largest number of Wall Street donations of anybody running on the Democratic side ever.
0.0	0.343278133936	Corporate inversion is one of the biggest problems we have.
0.0	0.672288037188	We ought to give them a little bit of a liability release so that they share data amongst themselves and share data with the federal government, they're not fearful of a lawsuit.
0.0	0.295133825006	I am not the candidate of Wall Street...
0.0	0.315794413191	We reduced violent crime to 30-year lows.
0.0	0.552587185235	But I just have to tell you that it's best with some of these things not be said.
0.0	0.489006345333	It just needs a corporate executive type at the top that's done it before.
0.0	0.344769128603	No, you did.
0.0	0.310401955648	I'm president -- look, I've done it once.
1.0	0.694906492712	And they would, despite all their tough talk about terrorism, continue to let people who are on the no-fly list buy guns.
0.0	0.36220464945	We must insist on assimilation -- immigration without assimilation is an invasion.
0.0	0.439830880685	They send their cars over by the millions, and what do we do?
0.0	0.478353161133	Because what she will do is come in and she will raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.595403740494	Well, let me be clear, if Donald engages in insults or anybody else, I don't intend to reciprocate.
0.0	0.668416786924	You know, the mother of the young man with his friends in the car who was playing loud music and, you know, some older white man pulled out a gun and shot him because they wouldn't turn the radio down.
0.0	0.271673458592	Syria is a mess.
0.0	0.315418612497	John, this is another one of those examples.
0.0	0.28816770243	He believes everything he stands for.
0.0	0.640338905409	The the truth of the matter is, big government benefits the wealthy, it benefits the lobbyists, it benefits the giant corporations.
0.0	0.291851220944	Could I just say -- just say this...
0.0	0.446054343624	I don't think the United States should be engaged in symbolic military activity.
0.0	0.674649180988	Now, our country could never do that because we'd have to get environmental clearance, and the environmentalist wouldn't let our country -- we would never build in an ocean.
0.0	0.683749597382	We didn't win that war just from the air, we won that war by assembling a group of Arab leaders who stood in the Rose Garden and stood with America.
0.0	0.668214975405	I just think there's got to be a way, and I would hope that our tech companies would work with government to figure that out.
0.0	0.513154606579	And now they see Hillary Clinton proposing a third term of economic policy for our country.
0.0	0.282834877482	Take it to the bank.
0.0	0.287029831146	They can't even answer simple questions.
0.0	0.535401175475	I would choose Nelson Mandela for his generosity of heart, his understanding of the need for reconciliation.
0.0	0.618419424715	David, look, this is the big -- I agree, by the way, that we should have paid family leave.
0.0	0.555440813623	Let us actually go to zero- based budgeting so we know where the money is being spent.
0.0	0.25839562247	Who denies that it is crazy...
0.0	0.354407003193	Next thing we do, pay equity for women workers.
0.0	0.335875065109	But...
0.0	0.277046829857	I looked into the eyes of Boy Scouts.
0.0	0.269575645127	That's American citizenship.
0.0	0.36505031875	But we shouldn't be the ones declaring that Assad must go.
0.0	0.276366106596	Yes.
0.0	0.661667152415	I frankly don't think there will be much change because I think what's going to happen is you're going to get more of the same.
0.0	0.443707122472	It was 25 years ago, and I came by defeating the Democratic incumbent.
0.0	0.339937981046	What you need to do is free up interest rates.
1.0	0.263835150343	Don't believe the 5.6.
0.0	0.677910087069	The fact of the matter is we the American people are not each other's enemies, it's those people who are trying to divide us who are the enemies.
0.0	0.297370031884	Got to be on the floor of the Senate.
0.0	0.269164369085	Republicans and Democrats alike believe this.
0.0	0.386840616525	What we need now is a proven leader who has produced results.
0.0	0.259434980396	We get Bergdahl.
0.0	0.335652420363	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.24596350626	Excuse me, no.
0.0	0.369967407653	I think he would have said bring back a 21st-century Glass-Steagall legislation.
0.0	0.269308619446	And, I'll tell you something else.
0.0	0.281414151614	The big banks--
0.0	0.464558126644	I really put that on Assad and on the Iraqis and on the region itself.
0.0	0.267949820855	Hey, I'm not saying they're stupid.
0.0	0.677339659077	Well, I don't agree with that, because we will not get the support on the ground in Syria to dislodge ISIS if the fighters there who are not associated with ISIS, but whose principal goal is getting rid of Assad, don't believe there is a political, diplomatic channel that is ongoing.
0.0	0.296174957969	He's the one that did Bergdahl.
0.0	0.293460353587	This actually is America's fight.
0.0	0.669920597837	We can save and preserve and strengthen Social Security by making no changes for seniors, but for younger workers gradually increasing the retirement age, changing the rate of growth so that it matches inflation, and critically allowing younger workers to keep a portion of our tax payments in a personal account that we own, we control them, we can pass on to our kids.
0.0	0.657500027261	It turns out some dot wasn't connected, and so the first thing we have to do is make sure that everyone and every responsible agency is attuned to all of these possibilities and symptoms.
0.0	0.541936490866	I'm very much against the government being involved in every aspect of our lives, you know?
0.0	0.29888933116	Total propaganda.
0.0	0.277007345918	Obama is going to be out playing golf.
0.0	0.664947737255	We have seniors out there who are scared to death because this Congress -- this one that we have right now, just stole $150 billion from the Social Security retirement fund to give it to the Social Security disability fund.
0.0	0.392712760672	But the first task is to bring countries together to destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.262534924606	That makes no sense to everybody.
0.0	0.521038428102	Our role in the world is not to roam the globe looking for new dictators to topple.
0.0	0.474320714285	And listen, there is a real difference between Marco's tax plan and mine.
0.0	0.28946165504	We should be supportive of that effort.
0.0	0.680715736796	So I believe that working with Europe -- and, by the way, you know, we've got some very wealthy countries there in that part of the world.
0.0	0.586442497404	It was good for the economy and it was a way to rebuke the terrorists who had attacked our country.
0.0	0.281759392814	Growth is the answer.
0.0	0.475624132185	Sure, because there has been three different investigations and proven that I knew nothing.
0.0	0.644821770219	Well, first off, what we don't do is do what Hillary Clinton and John Kerry and Barack Obama want us to do, which is their solution for everything, put more taxes on it, give more money to Washington, D.C., and then they will fix it.
0.0	0.589669522817	But I did pass a more progressive income tax and asked the highest-earning people to pay another 14 percent.
0.0	0.287510953433	We disagreed on the war in Iraq.
0.0	0.290986569597	But, let me tell you who not to blame.
0.0	0.273670361699	I came to Washington, D.C. in 1990.
0.0	0.5	But all of these politicians that I'm running against now, they're trying to disassociate.
0.0	0.268228397367	I am glad Donald is running.
0.0	0.593471257287	And I'll tell you what, Donald, you -- you very kindly just a moment ago offered me the V.P.
0.0	0.336723924192	You know, every election we hear a lot of talk.
0.0	0.315434603009	ISIS, now, is the major priority.
0.0	0.31209299459	I'll suggest a part of that was his celebrity.
0.0	0.638970251654	I am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of Vermont from very significant majorities of women.
0.0	0.25648490282	I don't like that.
0.0	0.494571590683	... and as president, I'm going to fight for the working men and women.
0.0	0.291969883803	My budget was mentioned.
0.0	0.391368434295	We cannot afford four more years of on the job training.
0.0	0.633382611922	And he also had no trouble appointing an investment banker to be in charge of his consumer protection bureau when he was governor.
0.0	0.631343350886	I believe that we should never give up our privacy; never should give up our freedoms in exchange for a promise of security.
0.0	0.288245548127	We lose with ISIS.
0.0	0.398425196186	We honest to god are here to get this country back on track.
0.0	0.278759802647	They do it to us, we don't it.
0.0	0.645591552648	Hardworking immigrant families living in fear, who should be brought out of the shadows so they and their children can have a better future.
0.0	0.283816865482	They were paid speeches.
0.0	0.349281654195	The days for the Clintons in public housing are over.
0.0	0.674277520696	John, listen, let's keep in mind that for one-third of the 60 million Americans on Social Security it represents 90 percent of their income.
0.0	0.663997565504	Caucus for me on Monday night because if I am your nominee, I will unite this party and I will defeat Hillary Clinton and when I'm president, America's light will shine again and the 21 century will be a new American century.
0.0	0.287443213127	We got nothing but problems.
0.0	0.270437119	I like them.
1.0	0.589124014533	We're spending $80 billion a year locking up fellow Americans.
0.0	0.323400392863	May I offer a different generation's perspective on this?
0.0	0.649076957813	That now includes the internet, because we have seen that ISIS is a very effective recruiter, propagandist and inciter and celebrator of violence.
0.0	0.5	I believe in the PTT because it's important those countries in Asia are interfacing against China.
0.0	0.277261189978	He wants to change America.
0.0	0.272405694474	We need to reverse that.
0.0	0.268387095888	We can't even go there.
0.0	0.290649546073	That debate reflected a debate between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks.
0.0	0.283776584203	We have a country of borders.
0.0	0.272221279973	I've done it.
0.0	0.224790620653	So did you, Marco.
0.0	0.24761542985	How stupid are they?
0.0	0.348978582659	America is best when we work in collaboration with our allies.
0.0	0.278387879667	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.597414375789	Yes, we could get rid of Assad tomorrow, but that would create another political vacuum that would benefit ISIS.
0.0	0.676229606443	Not armies massively marching on each other and air forces, but now we have dirty bombs and we have cyber attacks and we have people who will be attacking our electrical grid.
0.0	0.535330751613	I know it isn't something you just hope people will do and I've worked on that...
0.0	0.303904214611	Here is the one thing I'm not going to do.
0.0	0.351870987286	We have got to destroy their training camps and recruiting centers.
0.0	0.683420119792	If you listen to the State of the Union the other night, he described them as a bunch of guys with long beards on the back of a pickup truck.
0.0	0.675727458713	The reason all of us are here is we believe we should be fighting for the working men and women of this country, and not Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.684885844025	But I think it's important to understand there's a significant difference that I have with Senator Sanders about how best to provide quality, affordable health care for everyone.
0.0	0.644160323115	But then they're going to get a call from the donors or probably from the lobbyist for Ford and say, "You can't do that to Ford, because Ford takes care of me and I take care of you, and you can't do that to Ford."
0.0	0.286425536328	Now, Donald...
0.0	0.293019044697	Government is the enemy.
0.0	0.56576458046	African-Americans who face discrimination in the job market, education, housing, and the criminal justice system.
0.0	0.612580406028	But let me also tell you, one of the issues has got to be the integration of both community and police.
0.0	0.251279275587	We're gonna be there very soon.
0.0	0.5680089325	So we have a lot of work to do to get jobs going again, get incomes rising again.
0.0	0.270338094061	I love Donald Trump.
0.0	0.318535626517	And you combine that with reforms of our welfare system.
0.0	0.286995606408	We are doing both at the same time.
0.0	0.614440090237	We need to be much more far thinking in this new 21st century era of -- of nation state failures and conflict.
0.0	0.382241137426	So the answer is no and what Jeb said is absolutely correct.
0.0	0.292469127739	I strongly support the president's executive actions.
1.0	0.594700024315	If you look at a single mom buying groceries, she sees hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent.
0.0	0.554192376954	This is incredibly complicated, because we've got Iran as a big player, in addition to Russia.
0.0	0.339937981046	What you need to do is free up interest rates.
0.0	0.628207778005	You have six financial institutions today that have assets of 56 percent, equivalent to 56 percent of the GDP In America.
0.0	0.259307433355	Look at what's happening with the Republicans.
0.0	0.573359321057	We need to get back to training people in this country to do the jobs of the 21st century.
0.0	0.679889505688	And the fact of the matter is that the more fully people participate, the more our workers earn, the more they will spend, the more our economy will grow.
0.0	0.405524181426	If this all works out, I'm happy to consider naming you as V.P.
0.0	0.297200728385	Yes, I'm going to do away with that.
0.0	0.672806209649	Look, the truth is that a powerful nation like the United States, certainly working with our allies, we can overthrow dictators all over the world.
0.0	0.658107069807	But what is to prevent a future liberal president or a liberal Congress from coming back and not just raising the income tax, but also raising that VAT tax, and that vat tax is really bad for seniors.
0.0	0.665327951591	Next thing that we do, real unemployment -- official unemployment, 5 percent, real employment 10 percent, youth unemployment, off the charts.
0.0	0.528175155126	And frankly, if you want to be commander in chief, you have to have the experience.
0.0	0.668784733267	And with your vote and your support and your prayers, I will lead with the citizens of this great nation the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.5	I said right from the beginning that we should take no Syrian refugees of any kind.
0.0	0.28179321679	No, the new planes.
0.0	0.655813607192	I've said I'm looking at a couple of different ways, one which you mentioned, Senator, but also trying to expand the existing tax to passive income that wealthy people have so that we do get more revenue into the Social Security Trust Fund.
0.0	0.267723977372	Well, a couple of things.
0.0	0.268326992893	I was mentioned in the question.
1.0	0.316623986833	And some of them are like third world countries.
0.0	0.609627166735	Well, if that's the case, we're going to win every state, if Bernie Sanders is the nominee.
0.0	0.667444476735	First, we should pass the Expatriate Terrorist Act, legislation I've introduced that says if an American goes and joins ISIS and wages jihad against America, that you forfeit your citizenship and you can not come in on a passport.
0.0	0.590208042085	I like Marco too, and two years ago, he called me a conservative reformer that New Jersey needed.
0.0	0.490473403682	Because I think we have to get to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.238105985494	Who are we kidding?
0.0	0.660926129129	Planned Parenthood had better hope that Hillary Clinton wins this election, because I guarantee under President Jindal, January 2017, the Department of Justice and the IRS and everybody else that we can send from the federal government will be going in to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.218946335884	And I'm glad I did it.
0.0	0.575994560579	I still want to get back to health care, because I think that's a worthy topic to explore.
0.0	0.263637879389	... hillaryclinton.com, and read about it.
0.0	0.291750638205	Right there, right next to the plant.
0.0	0.258120137807	You bet they do.
0.0	0.344487016014	That is why there is massive despair all over this country.
0.0	0.671413558035	So, I want to look at the whole problem and that's why my proposal is much more comprehensive than anything else that's been put forth.
0.0	0.236455602617	It's nice.
0.0	0.275836575653	Not to contain them, but to defeat them.
0.0	0.267094513151	He sure did.
0.0	0.283088295734	Nobela (ph) is a rising entrepreneur.
1.0	0.436082852213	This president is undermining our military.
0.0	0.35345422453	It's great to be in a wonderful city, New York.
0.0	0.63848900601	But I want to talk -- I want to talk about something else, because Secretary Clinton I think made some interesting and good points.
0.0	0.255894145908	Yeah.
0.0	0.432132207746	Well, there is no evidence that they can fix anything in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.360996872721	We're one of the fastest growing states in the country.
0.0	0.294535374107	I understand we can disagree on the path forward.
0.0	0.260019762979	They will -- some will follow.
0.0	0.256119961888	And I watch the speeches.
0.0	0.265716774379	They don't know what they're doing.
0.0	0.33910362608	But what...
0.0	0.418751955175	(APPLAUSE) They're trying to prevent people from registering to vote.
0.0	0.546483831205	But out-of-pocket costs have gone up too much and prescription drug costs have gone through the roof.
0.0	0.276366106596	Yes.
0.0	0.669686453826	You know, on my very first visit to New Hampshire in this campaign, I was in Keene, and I was asked what are you going to do about the heroin epidemic?
0.0	0.282486432221	Bret, we're just starting.
0.0	0.270183418276	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.253577877199	We know about the Belgians.
0.0	0.390827114647	Focus on the diseases that are costing us the trillions of dollars.
0.0	0.337569381659	We put in place mandatory work fair (ph).
0.0	0.647544267658	What this campaign is not only about electing someone who has the most progressive agenda, it is about bringing tens of millions of people together to demand that we have a government that represents all of us and not just the 1 percent, who today have so much economic and political power.
0.0	0.267139124987	And we're talking about fantasy football?
0.0	0.460558915574	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, the slower the economy becomes.
0.0	0.629914677867	And we rebuilt downtown Manhattan, and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved New York and loved New Yorkers.
0.0	0.639468089191	Well, John, let me concur with you and with all Americans who are shocked and disgusted by what we saw in Paris yesterday.
0.0	0.583511027216	If I'm elected president, we will not let in refugees from countries controlled by ISIS or Al Qaida.
0.0	0.391575821638	I find it very, very hard to forgive people that deceived me.
0.0	0.259372005453	And you know what?
0.0	0.368879284638	I have voted not to give gun makers and sellers immunity.
0.0	0.279968997082	I said no.
0.0	0.631228622853	And you better get rid of them because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.676298990401	Well, I think, Judy, what has to be appreciated is that, as a result of the disastrous and illegal behavior on Wall Street, millions of lives were hurt.
0.0	0.259083086783	We don't need that.
0.0	0.24361900232	It is a disaster.
0.0	0.47380797968	I have nothing against the passion that my two friends here have about reinstating Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.335977807135	But let me go back to something that's very important.
0.0	0.24775825219	And that is what we have done in Ohio.
0.0	0.288407089492	Just get me a job.
0.0	0.296228110511	That's how you make peace in the world.
0.0	0.57855577408	Well, let me be clear about one thing, there's only one savior and it's not me.
0.0	0.359957843475	We need to pass a Medicare for all single payer system.
0.0	0.457158529312	They want everyone in this country to follow their religious beliefs the way they do.
0.0	0.288074572195	I just want a job.
0.0	0.65558009723	We had all kinds of questions that we discussed and, you know, at the end, I recommended to the president that we take the chance to do what we could to find out whether that was bin Laden and to finally bring him to justice.
0.0	0.257483121207	But this is what I do believe.
0.0	0.282511730337	But guess who pushed for that regulation?
0.0	0.278306820449	Well, sure.
0.0	0.685469583122	I also propose that we can pay for this with a tax on high volume trades and we need to because my dad came to college after World War II on a G.I.
0.0	0.251891129329	He was vibrant.
0.0	0.621311051666	To talk about we're just gonna have a 10 percent tithe and that's how we're gonna fund the government?
0.0	0.689679925501	All the way back to when Ronald Reagan signed a piece of legislation that basically allowed for amnesty for over 4 million people, and the border is still not secure.
0.0	0.265291111454	They're not sending you.
0.0	0.450635096963	We need the lawyers(ph) off the back of the war fighters.
0.0	0.609282879215	But the best way to close this gap is to modernize higher education so Americans have the skills for those jobs.
0.0	0.682538161232	If we had guns in California on the other side where the bullets went in the different direction, you wouldn't have 14 or 15 people dead right now.
0.0	0.375407596441	And they got a killer in San Bernardino in posing as a fiance.
0.0	0.317265158171	It can not be someone that agrees with his agenda.
0.0	0.5	You know, no public policy doesn't have, in some cases, negative consequences.
0.0	0.26696820456	That's not capitalism, Secretary Clinton.
0.0	0.287349052382	It needs to be repealed and replaced.
0.0	0.252260297492	I'm aware of that.
0.0	0.664972779454	Because when government gets big and powerful, the big feel like they need to get even bigger to deal with all that power, and meanwhile, the small and the powerless -- in this case, 1,590 community banks -- go out of business.
0.0	0.471710132765	I introduced a series of amendments, each designed to fix problems in the bill.
0.0	0.456629577396	Government trying to level the playing field between Internet and brick-and-mortar creates a problem.
0.0	0.467634563866	And, you know, for six-and-a-half years, we've had a gigantic party.
0.0	0.308259664455	is exactly the leadership we need in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.514555128558	But in order to bring about the changes that we need, we need a political revolution.
0.0	0.3981521909	And they've come pretty close to that without federal government assistance.
1.0	0.653590337414	We're sitting up here talking about all these other things; 71 percent of federal spending today is on entitlements, and debt service.
0.0	0.68427610007	Back in 2004, one of my predecessors to the Senate by the name of Bob Graham, a Democrat, ran for president missing over 30 percent of his votes.
1.0	0.46334423544	We owe $19 trillion, boy am I good at solving debt problems.
0.0	0.30686833723	We called in, we said, that's it.
0.0	0.303325591008	We're becoming Greece if we don't work together.
0.0	0.643395688651	And yes, when I am president of the United States, if there is some place in this country where radical jihadists are planning to attack the United States, we will go after them wherever they are, and if we capture them alive, they are going to Guantanamo.
0.0	0.266997017123	Well, thank you, John.
0.0	0.278322299593	And that's what you expect from a leader.
0.0	0.360622723646	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.289645770568	You want one?
0.0	0.319845356207	I released 34 years of tax returns...
0.0	0.612902364419	The government is not supposed to be in every part of our lives, and that is what is causing the problem.
0.0	0.540621593646	And you think about the reasons that we're having such difficulty right now with our job market.
0.0	0.270993715914	But we don't see it happening at all.
0.0	0.29688823776	We need to have stronger families.
0.0	0.66584431113	We need people who think out of the box and can solve problems; can utilize the resources around them; very smart people, to focus on the problem and solve the problem.
0.0	0.610950875664	I'm interested in making sure we get the maximum amount of revenue from those who can well afford to provide it.
0.0	0.639953506163	And when I'm president, we are going to bring it under control once and for all after 30 years of talking about it.
0.0	0.590255117984	There are loads of great ideas, great conservative ideas from wonderful think tanks about how to reform the tax code.
0.0	0.265603888598	Thank you all very much.
0.0	0.294187310124	Just for the record.
1.0	0.696268119862	Well, I would certainly build on the successes of the Affordable Care Act and work to fix some of the glitches that you just referenced.
0.0	0.267309922236	That was good for New York.
0.0	0.270241045565	Absolutely.
0.0	0.279621327732	And the fact is it was wrong.
0.0	0.676609602423	Absolutely, they should fight to fund -- defund Planned Parenthood, and I don't think the president should shut down the government simply to send our taxpayer dollars to this group.
0.0	0.269033965291	He was the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan.
0.0	0.644784130081	I deployed the National Guard after I stood on the ramp in Dallas, Texas and looked the president of the United States in the eye and said, "Mr. President, if you won't secure the border, Texas will," and that's exactly what we did.
0.0	0.231356452915	DICKERSON: A question from Kathie Obradovich.
0.0	0.637329717793	We have a lot of work to do, to better prepare our nation and to better lead this world into this new century.
0.0	0.493233370916	I don't think the founders put the Second Amendment as number two by accident.
0.0	0.645766851177	And the final thing I would say, bringing Donald Trump back into it, if you're going to put together a coalition in the region to take on the threat of ISIS you don't want to alienate the very countries and people you need to be part of the coalition.
0.0	0.367295656543	Our legal immigration system from now on has to be merit-based.
0.0	0.280079765716	You can change your mind.
0.0	0.262578712662	And you know, he's right.
0.0	0.568284087982	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.598224919773	And as someone who's worn the uniform of the country, that's how we build our military back up.
0.0	0.308064169258	I've seen plenty of other people follow up?
0.0	0.263617267522	I will be ready.
0.0	0.663863221003	We need to be very well aware of the fact that China and Russia are using technology to attack us, just as ISIS is using technology to recruit those who would murder American citizens.
1.0	0.294858848314	I never filed for bankruptcy.
0.0	0.278040102715	I didn't inherit any money.
0.0	0.270104381539	Folks, you want to --
0.0	0.657333352615	So I said to myself, you know, nobody's ever going to know unless I run, because I'm really proud of my success.
0.0	0.279528788554	Let me say this.
0.0	0.357618552097	There is a great deal of skepticism about the federal government.
0.0	0.290455318858	Why don't we let the process work.
0.0	0.689792033556	But look, there's one big entitlement we can no longer afford as a country, and that is the entitlement that the super wealthy among us, those earning more than a million dollars, feel that they're entitled to pay lower income tax rates and a far lower preferred income tax rate when it comes to capital gains.
0.0	0.407059260477	Senator, I have been -- I have been fighting for paid...
0.0	0.334492699819	Well, I've got news for you, we can.
0.0	0.667813342172	You know, it's -- it's a fact that if you can pay for a $79 one-way ticket to Orlando, and you can escape the challenges of a declining economy and high crime rates, you move to Orlando.
0.0	0.289896821427	He doesn't meet -- here's the difference.
0.0	0.393734791143	So, yes, we can talk about it as a racial issue.
0.0	0.609455810869	We're closing hospitals, we're closing wards, we're closing so many because the states want to save money.
0.0	0.368035407667	Not solely ours, but we must work collaboratively with other nations.
1.0	0.289123833544	They're bringing crime.
0.0	0.293313658482	So, your original question is the right question.
0.0	0.307893187913	We pay federal taxes.
0.0	0.286457849431	There are hundreds of things like that.
0.0	0.435043287088	Imagine -- imagine -- if a politician were held to that standard of account.
0.0	0.25458817208	We all understand that.
0.0	0.370373004154	This is money that people have confiscated out of their paychecks.
0.0	0.520505639801	I think issues and substance, policy and vision and record should be the meat of politics.
0.0	0.620226056827	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.297237365112	I can govern by bringing people together.
0.0	0.273288818417	Wait a minute.
0.0	0.602430680055	Because, I've got to tell you the truth, even in New Jersey what you're doing is called rude.
0.0	0.27289936661	They don't know what they're doing."
0.0	0.645277603877	And the answer is: Because they know I will go right after them, that I will not let their agenda be America's agenda.
0.0	0.64912020662	So let's support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition.
0.0	0.278638475951	They're absolutely false.
0.0	0.26145398206	I know how hard that is.
0.0	0.657196232641	...is the lowest personal rate any candidate up here has, and what it would also enable us to do is for every citizen to fill out their taxes on a postcard so we can eliminate the IRS.
0.0	0.345373165638	Because this president has consistently underestimated the threat of ISIS.
0.0	0.5	And now we have to accept 2 percent, the new normal for economic growth.
0.0	0.684287815265	Just last week, we see saw two Iraqi refugees vetted using the same process the president says will work, that were arrested for being alleged ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.271135078118	I introduced...
0.0	0.669969970828	And if people want a more high-minded politics and want to move our country forward, go on to martinomalley.com and help my campaign move our country forward.
0.0	0.646804025666	And they'll be proud, and they'll love it, and they'll make much more than they would've ever made, and they'll be -- they'll be doing so well, and we're going to be thriving as a country, thriving.
0.0	0.282257399092	I didn't say permanently.
0.0	0.282447745666	And we do have to form a coalition.
1.0	0.379124637588	Today, we have 272.
0.0	0.67899499048	That is what this debate is all about, and I would suggest let's stay focused on those issues -- rather than just attacks directed at each other.
0.0	0.295876004135	I don't recall them calling for his resignation --
0.0	0.677793385603	This president and John Kerry and Hillary Clinton all have made it harder for the next president to act, but he must act to confront the ambitions of Iran.
0.0	0.281813309522	That's a hard road to walk.
0.0	0.342114216238	No -- no...
0.0	0.345726640978	And, here's what she said to the American people.
0.0	0.642314716904	I can see why people are angry and scared, because this president has created a condition where our national security has weakened dramatically.
0.0	0.314935407526	$24 trillion.
0.0	0.658780749494	I think with this kind of barbarism and nihilism, it's very hard to understand, other than the lust for power, the rejection of modernity, the total disregard for human rights, freedom, or any other value that we know and respect.
0.0	0.304507749931	As governor, we continued to work together.
0.0	0.287593016521	Well, I would just repeat that.
0.0	0.299319868304	That means education.
0.0	0.279155051317	We need to figure this out together.
1.0	0.318666106418	We borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.261105624835	So nice, thank you very much.
0.0	0.645409266505	And it is imperative that we do more not only to help our friends and partners protect themselves and protect our own homeland, but also to work to try to deal with this arc of instability, which does have a lot of impact on what happens in a country like Libya.
0.0	0.296171672448	They're a feeding frenzy for sick people.
0.0	0.467667314169	Who do you know will kill the terrorists, defend the constitution and repeal Obamacare?
0.0	0.361225326229	Let's talk about something that happened this week in the news.
0.0	0.291975444272	Enough said.
0.0	0.305324437985	We went after those who had attacked us.
0.0	0.293561966977	I don't think a halt is necessary.
0.0	0.570044584686	We took a loan against our assets to invest it in that campaign to defend ourselves against those attacks.
1.0	0.664076251528	Under longstanding U.S. law, the child of a U.S. citizen born abroad is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.668669142792	We don't need Hillary Clinton's price controls for -- again, does anybody out there think that giving Washington, D.C., the opportunity to run the pharmaceutical industry is a good idea, given how well they have done running the government?
0.0	0.668850113498	And therefore, they don't get the income tax break, but their prices are going to be higher, because the vat tax is embedded in both the prices that business that are charging and in the wages they pay their employees.
0.0	0.265443683395	It was an excruciating experience.
0.0	0.286623694261	You lead and you produce results.
0.0	0.284257909062	We're up 400,000 jobs.
0.0	0.240207698967	Divide that out.
0.0	0.630928002993	I believe if we lead an air coalition, which we are now in the position of doing and intensify it, if we continue to build back up the Iraqi army, which has had some recent success in Ramadi, as you know, if we get back talking to the tribal sheiks in Anbar to try to rebuild those relationships, which were very successful, in going after Al Qaida in Iraq, if we get the Turks to pay more attention to ISIS than they're paying to the Kurds, if we do put together the kind of coalition with the specific tasks that I am outlining, I think we can be successful in destroying ISIS.
0.0	0.597214835047	And we finally have a U.N. Security Council Resolution bringing the world together to go after a political transition in Syria.
0.0	0.331842009089	Effectively it is day trading without any regulation at all.
0.0	0.665674498386	When I ran in Texas, I told the people of Texas, "if you elect me, I will lead the fight against amnesty."
0.0	0.629151067172	I don't know if people understand, but I spent a lifetime with my colleagues getting us to a federal balanced budget.
0.0	0.526438871608	And I'm not standing here today and saying that Libya is as far along as Tunisia.
0.0	0.493185244303	So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.430912867031	I think it ought to be a compact -- families contribute, kids contribute.
0.0	0.251947142479	They didn't do that either.
0.0	0.669945616448	It's the reason why I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and led the fight to stop the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, because it was clear then, like it's clear now, that border security is national security.
0.0	0.291156748348	Now we're having smaller families.
1.0	0.644709217892	It enabled him -- the president to certify them en masse without mandating meaningful background checks.
0.0	0.302359413588	Last point.
0.0	0.514028071713	The billionaire and the working man, no hedge fund manager pays less than his secretary.
0.0	0.311745155301	... that's what you say in a primary.
0.0	0.647075688087	And that problem is too big regulations like the EPA, too much new taxes on business that we have seen and "Obamacare."
0.0	0.288838228331	But I...
0.0	0.271391810338	That is an egregious act.
0.0	0.280438196522	Well, yes, indeed.
0.0	0.283034172774	Jeb, please attack Ted..."
0.0	0.656500053276	We're going to combine all commercial activity in business into one place in the tax code and charge it 15 percent, which is going to suddenly make us competitive with the rest of the world.
0.0	0.623123828254	... first of all, I'm -- don't worry, I'm not leaving the stage no matter what you ask me.
0.0	0.301746859632	Without China, North Korea doesn't even eat.
0.0	0.609667470332	Here is the story -- it's not just the college graduates should be $50,000 or $100,000 in debt.
0.0	0.343470855434	At least he's honest enough to call himself a socialist.
0.0	0.652402719096	I buy it, because, frankly, I have an obligation to buy it, because they devalue their currency so brilliantly, they just did it recently, and nobody thought they could do it again.
0.0	0.614462620076	And I'm so grateful for the diligence, for the seriousness with which the men and women of Iowa approach this process.
0.0	0.268868487045	It goes in the right direction.
0.0	0.623215117683	So he had to leave the Situation Room after hearing from the small group advising him and he had to make that decision.
0.0	0.598186484432	Furthermore, in a competitive global economy, it is imperative that we have the best educated workforce in the world.
0.0	0.279155004823	And let me be clear.
0.0	0.329719514835	I don't think we're at war with all Muslims.
0.0	0.559728896314	Most importantly, I think I understand leadership, which sometimes requires a tough call in a tough time.
0.0	0.348182039156	Now it is their time to help the middle class.
0.0	0.624104202895	Republican leadership joined with every single Democrat, add $80 trillion to our debt to do nothing to fix the problems.
0.0	0.655405514662	Now, it is true that there are a bunch of lobbyists, and a bunch of Democrats in this state spending millions of dollars trying to convince the people of Iowa that I somehow oppose ethanol.
0.0	0.382067327172	People lost their jobs, their homes, their life savings.
0.0	0.598639032953	Let me tell you, if we don't get this election right, there may be no turning back for America.
0.0	0.455353275186	Well, Neil, I think we've got to work on a two-pronged approach.
0.0	0.644249758686	And we have to support Sunni-Arab and Kurdish forces against ISIS, because I believe it would be not only a strategic mistake for the United States to put ground combat troops in, as opposed to special operators, as opposed to trainers, because that is exactly what ISIS wants.
0.0	0.292283923929	KELLY: Go ahead, Governor Christie.
0.0	0.666326144726	We are at the threshold of a new era of American progress, but it's going to require that we act as Americans, based on our principles, here at home, making an economy that works for all of us.
0.0	0.685579494672	But if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things, including corporate taxes, and including the capital gains taxes, you make that amount up pretty quickly.
0.0	0.280198739546	He's the greatest show on earth.
0.0	0.303365095115	So it wasn't just me who opposed it.
0.0	0.342114216238	No, no.
0.0	0.556212613709	Barack Obama right now, number one, over seven years, has dramatically degraded our military.
0.0	0.602130919847	Now, what I think is that right now we have got to do our best in developing positive relations with Russia.

0.0	0.244854649561	Well, it ain't Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.269871127899	Now, this is getting to be fun.
0.0	0.279431098727	The other issue is mental health.
0.0	0.59313473396	Because that's what we'd get if it were Jeb -- I tell you what, we don't need that.
0.0	0.665530376219	They don't care about American workers, they just care about bringing as many people in so they can get as many votes as they can.
0.0	0.280600606808	They wouldn't be there except for us.
0.0	0.332968314624	What the legislation is is $1.61 a week.
0.0	0.506853106307	We need to make police departments look like the communities they serve in terms of diversity.
0.0	0.392271266426	We need comprehensive gun safety legislation and a ban on assault weapons.
0.0	0.39254157022	I was ready to lead, but I wasn't ready to run.
0.0	0.272665676856	You have a bigger problem with China.
0.0	0.221775323577	I am against the raids.
0.0	0.262586797927	I said, "Very interesting."
0.0	0.285785150584	Secretary Clinton, I don't have a super PAC.
0.0	0.683796111756	When I'm president, we are rebuilding the U.S. military because the world is a safer and a better place when America is the strongest military in the world.
0.0	0.267863972253	They do celebrate more dependence on the government.
0.0	0.671031492829	I -- I think -- I think as Democrats we ought to proudly support the Affordable Care Act, improve it, and make it the model that we know it can be.
0.0	0.243638207598	I'll take that, too.
0.0	0.242570783513	This is a humanitarian catastrophe.
0.0	0.272484260716	Marco, please attack Ted.
0.0	0.659300106914	Good company.... one of the early things I would do, probably before I even got in -- and I wouldn't even use -- you know, I have -- I know the smartest negotiators in the world.
0.0	0.270241045565	Absolutely.
0.0	0.400089513226	And here's the problem with what's going on around the world.
0.0	0.290726952315	You know why three?
0.0	0.279518716312	What have you got now?
0.0	0.653721563162	And that is why I am pledged, if elected president of the United States, to bring about a political revolution where millions of people begin to stand up and finally say enough is enough, this great country and our government belong to all of us, not just a handful of billionaires.
0.0	0.3535169812	I am the only person on this stage who has actually...
0.0	0.5	I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would.
0.0	0.524236100098	They're not going to turn into stockbrokers overnight or open up a chain of car washes.
0.0	0.273992848592	Then I looked at Rubio.
0.0	0.281586058269	But, I would also add this.
0.0	0.637091573808	I agree with President Obama who used executive orders to protect families because the Congress, the House was unable or refused to act.
0.0	0.246585410608	But I would add this.
0.0	0.34744978885	I was not at all.
0.0	0.599758810459	No, I said, " I would use -- " they were asking me what to do about North Korea.
0.0	0.574374621636	I mean, you looked at Bush, it took him five days to answer the question on Iraq.
0.0	0.477420730303	The only way we're going to solve this problem is with we, the people.
0.0	0.315069675537	Stop the Washington bull and let's get things done.
0.0	0.513511815395	I will, with your help and support, lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.283649198853	Let me just jump in.
0.0	0.278811203953	Well, let me tell you this.
0.0	0.555491455552	I think he was probably the most honest man in politics that we've ever seen in a generation.
0.0	0.340530873967	I am proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend.
0.0	0.316303146532	It's a simple flat tax for everyone.
0.0	0.528027933308	Yes, the wealthiest people, the top 1.5 percent, will pay more in taxes.
0.0	0.680006537201	I'm the only one on this stage that has a plan that would create jobs, cut taxes, balance the budget and can get it done because I'm realistic.
0.0	0.486428012612	We both believe there has to be more money going into the Social Security system.
0.0	0.532442899507	And I just want to say, you know, last week we released our tax plan.
0.0	0.38359166413	I was down there, and I've never seen anything like it.
0.0	0.306684182967	And let me make a final point on this.
0.0	0.289111952695	No one here is under FBI investigation.
0.0	0.427854907559	But he used to say, "Donald, don't go into Manhattan.
0.0	0.335875065109	These...
0.0	0.365241040127	I want to be in -- I want America to be the best...
0.0	0.666499329012	I have made the decisions that need to be made as a governor to protect us and as president of the United States, no one will keep this country safer than I will.
0.0	0.295866555346	It really is important that we go forward on this.
0.0	0.342434823733	My dad was a small businessman, a really small business.
0.0	0.252187417488	We can do that in Washington.
0.0	0.316705044207	Number two, this isn't me saying it.
0.0	0.647776185065	I honored my commitments, and as president, I will honor every commitment that I make to the men and women of this country.
0.0	0.361309651941	But in addition to that, we have to have fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.645096987611	And also -- also, what we should be clear about is we end up spending -- and I think the secretary knows this -- far more per capita on health care than any other major country, and our outcomes, health care outcomes are not necessarily that good.
0.0	0.243333380983	They are not perfect.
0.0	0.308319319907	CLINTON: Oh, wait a minute, senator.
0.0	0.297178951379	Reforming entitlements, cutting taxes.
0.0	0.276068633521	It's not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.332923881255	We've got to stop this culture of government dependence.
0.0	0.558480335021	I think that sets us apart from a lot of what's happening right now on the Republican side.
0.0	0.470385910681	We're going to let people in, but they're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.247881970686	We can't do this unilaterally.
0.0	0.282724913499	Now Maria, listen.
0.0	0.661802650992	She has devoted her life, when I was mayor of the city of Burlington, actually when I first met her, we started a youth office, which started a after-school programs for kids, started a child care center, started a youth newspaper.
0.0	0.565995511842	If we means test Social Security, it means that the government decides whether or not I deserve it.
0.0	0.529479415602	Because we have no protection and we have no competence, we don't know what's happening.
0.0	0.266047218982	Not everybody remembers that.
0.0	0.679567562042	I particularly appreciate the proposal that Congressman Jim Clyburn has -- the 10-20-30 proposal -- to try to spend more federal dollars in communities with persistent generational poverty.
0.0	0.552710287712	This is a part of the world where the United States has tried to play two different approaches.
0.0	0.549665545885	The last thing we need is to throw our country into a contentious debate about health care again.
0.0	0.474353267307	And here's an area where Secretary Clinton and I believe we have a difference.
0.0	0.329600789719	I'm a Catholic, I believe life begins at conception.
0.0	0.66956425016	Any connection to the fact that not one Republican candidate for president thinks and agrees with the scientific community that climate change is real and that we have got to transform our energy system?
0.0	0.305645576749	We actually passed a living wage.
0.0	0.34074952842	Neil, Neil -- can I say one thing about this.
0.0	0.513540886979	We cannot let things get farther down the road, like we did with North Korea.
0.0	0.53794580888	Where I see the weakness is in those three people that are left on the Democratic stage.
0.0	0.321159792325	They said they'd shrink and balance the budget.
0.0	0.613945732843	You find a Democrat that's for cutting taxes -- cutting spending ten dollars, I'll give them a warm kiss.
0.0	0.321821555195	I believe that we need to focus on destroying ISIL.
0.0	0.670413092328	I agree, however, it doesn't go far enough, because what it focuses on are the big banks, which Senator Sanders has talked about a lot, for good reason.
0.0	0.653691007922	And it is unfair simply to say how much more the program will cost without making sure that people know that, we are doing away with cost of private insurance and that the middle class will be paying substantially less for health care on the single payer than on the Secretary's Clinton proposal.
0.0	0.305884354211	Well, I want to know, did you win?
0.0	0.579188464712	Today in America we have more people in jail than any other country on earth, 2.2 million people.
0.0	0.232478951529	It's a joke.
0.0	0.446626998177	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, it is demonstrably true...
0.0	0.261806711016	John?
0.0	0.280723099691	Now, on to your substantive question.
0.0	0.685799709502	But it was not on a second filing with FDIC and yes, I made a paperwork error disclosing it on one piece of paper instead of the other.
0.0	0.567628838094	Well I think a lot of people are understandably reacting out of fear and anxiety about what they're seeing.
0.0	0.306636485796	Maria, I assume that I can respond to that.
0.0	0.569294936781	Well, I think it's perfectly fair to say that we invested quite a bit in development aid.
0.0	0.683968597694	I think half of the -- more than half of the people in my own state of Vermont, my guess here in New Hampshire, are gun owners.
1.0	0.306135776141	They just built a hotel in Syria.
0.0	0.453870259143	Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns.
0.0	0.25651637662	And, look, there are profound differences...
0.0	0.284946347069	No one is a socialist.
0.0	0.646156809334	My friend Kashif, who is a doctor in Maryland; back to this issue of our danger as a democracy of turning against ourselves.
0.0	0.292144406782	And they came back with 23 recommendations.
0.0	0.294334488327	So there are people watching tonight in business.
0.0	0.618513900054	I'm an eye surgeon from Bowling Green, Kentucky, I miss doing eye surgery, still get to do a little bit.
0.0	0.607777775888	I have said that we could leave it to the states but I've also introduced a federal solution as well.
0.0	0.433016323345	We have got to come forward with a consensus that in fact will work.
0.0	0.283418319854	We are at war with violent extremism.
0.0	0.400278974128	They knew they were talking about the issues of attacking people, Megyn.
0.0	0.39302574155	Well, I'm just not sure I agree completely with that assessment.
0.0	0.300660537867	We need to bring people together in Washington.
0.0	0.671119749396	And I said, "well, if he wanted to play a song, maybe he could play, 'New York, New York'?"
0.0	0.519517913306	I have a proven record as governor of the state of Florida, as a conservative leader.
0.0	0.349823358448	We've been struggling to get this done since Harry Truman.
0.0	0.685582958262	Through stupidity, in a very, very hard core prison, interestingly named Clinton, two vicious murderers, two vicious people escaped, and nobody knows where they are.
0.0	0.657178274946	Well, Chris, I will apologize to nobody for the vigorousness with which I will fight terrorism, go after ISIS, hunt them down wherever they are, and utterly and completely destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.284210669577	And we also need a cheerleader.
0.0	0.291648415908	I don't need anybody's money.
0.0	0.667452763159	I'm running for president to knock down all the barriers that are holding Americans back, and to rebuild the ladders of opportunity that will give every American a chance to advance, especially those who have been left out and left behind.
0.0	0.648864452429	It's what we did in the first Persian Gulf war; 1,100 air attacks a day, saturation bombing that utterly destroyed the enemy.
0.0	0.356051334014	Here, we actually need 1,000 because we have natural barriers.
0.0	0.580538941792	And it's not too much to ask of our generation after everything our parents and our grandparents did for us.
0.0	0.256232881535	But Obamacare kicks in in 2016.
0.0	0.538031958221	And that's what we need to be doing to the best of our ability in our country.
0.0	0.538916806684	Well, it's not a matter of what the first executive order would be, Bill.
0.0	0.214346147021	Don't do it."
0.0	0.5	The American people are never going to trust Washington, D.C., and for good reason.
0.0	0.255894145908	Yeah.
0.0	0.589890351203	Young people for whom getting involved in politics is as, you know, it's like going to the moon.
0.0	0.361479001896	First of all, let's have some rules here, commentators.
0.0	0.599386971437	Mine is the only plan that saves over $1 trillion and that's why I'm answering your question.
0.0	0.288501324096	The world has changed.
0.0	0.273544847273	But you know what we did in Maryland?
0.0	0.272113969503	All right.
0.0	0.431267106247	There'll be people here that will talk about what they're going to do.
0.0	0.685275263962	I started as a secretary and became ultimately the chief executive of the largest technology company in the world, almost $90 billion in over 150 countries.
0.0	0.659373748912	There was a lot of activism on campus -- Civil Rights activism, antiwar activism, women's rights activism -- and I do appreciate the way young people are standing up and speaking out.
0.0	0.238213242233	She's not the threat.
0.0	0.630961881561	We have a stock market that, frankly, has been good to me, but I still hate to see what's happening.
0.0	0.632154275471	I built a net worth of way over $10 billion, and I have done it four times out of hundreds.
0.0	0.482709605309	You will have welcomed Heidi and our girls, Caroline and Catherine, into your homes.
0.0	0.675887978739	Regulations in this country are out of control, especially the Employment Prevention Agency, the EPA, and all of the rules they continue to impose on our economy and hurting us.
0.0	0.617723586217	When those buildings came down, she was trapped in her building and I didn't hear from her over six hours.
0.0	0.255962577326	He does great.
0.0	0.436270161629	I believe that all of our kids should go into an income-based repayment plan.
0.0	0.304490531175	We have made it easier to do that, not harder.
0.0	0.257254450035	That is important.
0.0	0.284238635689	It's a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.480659629108	You know the nice thing about the mainstream media, they don't hide their views.
0.0	0.276943979025	Right.
0.0	0.317522521651	He just writes out an order, executive order.
0.0	0.645733322364	The agreement on a cease-fire, though, is something that has to be implemented more quickly than the schedule that the Russians agreed to.
0.0	0.267430184938	Did she do a great job?
0.0	0.286475206613	in particular.
0.0	0.260242450718	So they put together this.
0.0	0.300737040698	It was a big insurance company, AIG.
0.0	0.272444935621	Go ahead.
0.0	0.354560285826	And we can no longer continue to sweep it under the rug.
0.0	0.359759320868	We don't have procurement being done for refreshing the equipment.
0.0	0.320572627757	We can end sanctuary cities by cutting off...
0.0	0.34744978885	That's what he is.
0.0	0.290226178459	We were behind where we were today.
0.0	0.250974302689	Chris?
0.0	0.684107930157	Thousands of people killed, and the cleanup started the next day, and it was the most horrific cleanup, probably in the history of doing this, and in construction.
1.0	0.620226056827	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.431989199996	But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work.
0.0	0.679412113445	I think the only argument is are we a sovereign country, are we not allowed to choose who comes in, when they come in and how they come in?
0.0	0.29634564308	The intelligence was by no means absolute.
0.0	0.256088200331	Well, it's interesting.
0.0	0.673230048409	I believe I can get the money that I need by taxing the wealthy, by closing loopholes, the things that we are way overdue for doing.
0.0	0.490662908479	You know, everybody says every election's important, and there's truth to that.
0.0	0.573962871932	My parents in this country were able to give me the chance to do all the things they never did.
0.0	0.279551043934	Now, what does that mean?
0.0	0.305368264839	Senator Cruz, I'd like to respond...
0.0	0.238871216963	Thank you.
0.0	0.412855791611	We went after companies that were doing things that were against the law.
0.0	0.685650355678	If you are now hit on a 60 percent tax on both your income and on the wages you pay your employees, where are you going to get that money from?
0.0	0.559355491425	It was some of the most progressive members of the United States Congress who opposed it for that reason.
0.0	0.454477754888	Here is the case, they both agree, they can't make a deal.
0.0	0.243406884841	It's good to be with you.
0.0	0.689758263851	So we pay for this by do demanding that the wealthiest people and the largest corporations, who have gotten away with murder for years, start paying their fair share.
0.0	0.279532309478	We know this for a fact.
0.0	0.24361900232	It's a disaster.
0.0	0.300683425945	You would say maybe two, maybe four?
0.0	0.644922942631	And that's what you'll hear from Hillary Clinton -- and I've already heard from her -- is that, send more money in Social Security, send more money in Medicare taxes, send more money for Medicaid, and that's gonna solve the problem.
0.0	0.529179817909	But I want to say a quick word about what Senator Sanders and then Governor O'Malley said.
0.0	0.46149629391	I've got the scars to show from the effort back in the early '90s.
0.0	0.261681000402	Oh, I'll talk about that, too.
0.0	0.659811073797	What kind of signal does that send to the rest of the world that the United States is a serious player in creating peace and security?
0.0	0.315369642388	..."diabetes, heart disease, cancer and Alzheimer's?"
0.0	0.674848308985	Now, Ford announces a few weeks ago that Ford is going to build a $2.5 billion car and truck and parts manufacturing plant in Mexico.
0.0	0.388668586824	The talk has got to stop, the action has got to begin.
0.0	0.268186596897	They can have it anyway you want.
0.0	0.267828305994	Because I've done it.
0.0	0.5	Yes, we could get rid of Saddam Hussein, but that destabilized the entire region.
0.0	0.284435114167	But I believe in the Teddy Roosevelt philosophy.
0.0	0.653512430638	I've created tens of thousands of jobs, and in all due respect -- and actually some of these folks I really like a lot -- but I'm the only one that can say that.
0.0	0.265337779422	I looked at the intelligence.
0.0	0.261859513757	We need Jordan.
0.0	0.548814879184	In our own city, I mentioned before, we had become the most addicted city in America.
0.0	0.287444593605	They're killing us.
0.0	0.524864949922	And, you know, I don't know all the details of what Rick Snyder has done.
0.0	0.425957909847	...This is a matter not of math, this is a matter of morality.
0.0	0.284077282959	My name was mentioned.
0.0	0.278863947582	Could we have your support?
0.0	0.292237666068	I'd sign that executive order.
0.0	0.286251884756	It will be a long day.
0.0	0.267488682209	That's what Chris Stevens was trying to do.
0.0	0.291541777727	We can re-assume our role in the world.
0.0	0.645699523192	And we also need to make sure that the really discriminatory messages that Trump is sending around the world don't fall on receptive ears.
0.0	0.681400770487	And, of course, we have to continue to do what is necessary when someone like Gadhafi, a despot with American blood on his hands, is overturned.
0.0	0.506344087056	We have to provide the NATO support to back up the mission that is going on.
0.0	0.335875065109	No.
0.0	0.646965172558	And I thought it was horrible when it was broadcast on television, because boy, does that send signals to Putin and all of the other people that look at us and they say, "That is a group of people, and that is a nation that truly has no clue.
0.0	0.29874476521	They get them on the black market.
0.0	0.397996698248	You know, you claim it is tough talk to discuss carpet bombing.
0.0	0.688570131213	And, this year, in 2015, New Jersey's had the best year of job growth that our state has ever had in the last 15 years.
0.0	0.320740246056	And then what he did is redefine the role of government.
0.0	0.279557299148	We must anticipate these threats before they happen.
0.0	0.298514144551	I think that would have been right, as well.
0.0	0.664877189048	Some of the bravest people that I had the privilege of working with as secretary of state were our development professionals who went sometimes alone, sometimes with our military, into very dangerous places in Iraq, in Afghanistan, elsewhere.
0.0	0.451394953019	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.306234446788	There's never going do be perfect bill.
0.0	0.278194036838	We saw that in Egypt.
0.0	0.364072073463	That's why we have this abnormal situation going on right now.
0.0	0.267816133662	Break them up.
0.0	0.25947377736	I think there is a consensus.
0.0	0.245074686621	That's calling it what it is.
0.0	0.659868724756	Yeah.  TRUMP R 15 75 0 N So I finally got it over there and they charged me a big tariff.  TRUMP R 15 75 1 N They're not supposed to be doing that.  TRUMP R 15 75 2 N I told them.
0.0	0.294192412619	I have fully endorsed those.
0.0	0.65327739283	That is why they're building an -- right now, developing long- range missiles capable of reaching the United States, and that is why there's going -- they're going to use those $100 billion to expand their conventional capabilities and to one day buy or build a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.642812154102	My plan would sweep all of them into a regulatory framework so we can try to get ahead of what the next problems might be.
0.0	0.364259688582	The question was, would you meet with an adversary without conditions?
0.0	0.370996978622	Truth is that far more blacks get stopped for traffic violations.
0.0	0.270664297311	Let's hope that it holds.
0.0	0.623941282575	But what the DNC did arbitrarily without discussing it with us is shut off our access to our information crippling our campaign.
0.0	0.564053709369	Anybody who tells me that we need every penny and every one of those is in a fantasy world.
0.0	0.3126384317	That makes the world less peaceful, less safe.
0.0	0.339075816719	My daughters went to college on a mountain of bills.
1.0	0.574275928025	$5 billion we spent on a Web site, and to this day it doesn't work.
0.0	0.269002755926	Unintended consequences.
0.0	0.629124638444	I do not see -- want to see one parent or loved one worrying about getting a call in the middle of the night.
0.0	0.659757880997	Well, let me tell you one thing that I am the only guy: The only guy that has consistently fought the Clinton machine every election I was ever in over the past 26 years.
0.0	0.608830610653	Now, the challenge we're seeing today is that the Supreme Court is being converted into some type of political body.
0.0	0.276943979025	Right.
0.0	0.2780671197	We hear a lot of good plans.
0.0	0.668879386931	Well, I think you have to look at both the terrorism challenge that we face abroad and certainly at home and the role that guns play in delivering the violence that stalks us.
0.0	0.407421583469	It's Jesus Christ who came down to earth and died for our sins.
0.0	0.411940674636	We have to do the best possible job of sharing intelligence and information.
0.0	0.28018905282	You didn't see it for a minute.
0.0	0.358907460824	Here's the bottom line, and I'll close with this.
0.0	0.418246610231	That is what the Democrats in the Senate have put forward as a proposal.
0.0	0.380309212908	And, that's why tonight I'm asking you for your vote.
0.0	0.272949113609	Secretary Clinton, I do have a disagreement here.
0.0	0.275948133706	Your prosecute criminals.
0.0	0.66577737323	You know, they feel like if they don't have a lobbyist, if they're not wealthy, that somehow they don't get to play.
0.0	0.438001403617	Those are the things we brought, and we were able to get things done.
0.0	0.620141186922	And it is a -- the kind of criticism that we've heard from Senator Sanders about our president I expect from Republicans.
0.0	0.676417132446	I'll tell you this, the number one job of the president of the United States is to protect the safety and security of the American people.
0.0	0.646590529488	Number one, most important economic reality of today is that over the last 30 years, there has been a transfer of trillions of dollars from the middle class to the top one-tenth of one percent who are seeing a doubling of the percentage of wealth that they own.
0.0	0.253836171519	I think what is...
0.0	0.644883476733	And if you're going to leave this to Hillary Clinton, the person who gave us this foreign policy, the architect of it, and you're going to give her another four years, that's why I'm speaking out as strongly as I am about that.
0.0	0.640676006305	You know, need to stop allowing political correctness to dictate our policies, because it's going to kill us if we don't.
0.0	0.5	It had missed, before I had arrived, expectations for nine quarters in a row.
0.0	0.23990684679	Here's the truth.
0.0	0.410313565933	I did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild.
0.0	0.467090069858	... no, you already had your chance, Marco, and you blew it.
0.0	0.373086949666	The big corporations have the scale to deal with all of this.
0.0	0.604018285825	So, we are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we have to root out in our society.
0.0	0.281790235334	And here's what the economic issue is.
0.0	0.661513168182	And it is from the lessons from history that we do this because if we allow this to fester, we're going to have Islamic terrorism, multi-generations of it all across this country.
0.0	0.65800751699	I'm running for president because our economy is rigged because working people are working longer hours for lower wages and almost all of new wealth and income being created is going to the top one percent.
0.0	0.273180060386	And we will be strong again.
0.0	0.62977006774	The great failing of these last 10 or 15 years, John, has been our failing of human intelligence on the ground.
0.0	0.6850053988	Why is it that we are spending per capita far, far more than Canada, which is 100 miles away from my door, that guarantees health care to all people?
0.0	0.506058284253	I do not believe a vote in 2002 is a plan to defeat ISIS in 2016.
0.0	0.299046405419	But it is a general economic issue.
0.0	0.680001083149	When I am president of the United States, I'm going to side with Ronald Regan on this and not Nancy Pelosi and we are not having a vat tax.
0.0	0.523327529767	I do not believe that we have to destroy our economy in order to protect our environment.
0.0	0.675057413447	So what we do, though, is, if there is somebody who is price- gouging, we have laws for prosecutors to take that on.
1.0	0.392860659985	It came out recently they have equipment that is 30 years old.
0.0	0.634895007529	We have not made the investments that we need to make to understand and to have relationships with future leaders that are coming up.
0.0	0.468857185496	Our greatest days lie ahead if we are willing to do what it takes now.
0.0	0.68051103789	And by the way, the attack he keeps throwing out on the military budget, Marco knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion.
0.0	0.580475390429	I was flattered that Secretary Clinton two months later borrowed so many of my proposals to incorporate into hers.
0.0	0.276887097813	When I'm president, that will change.
0.0	0.32925335035	The president tried to paint a rosy picture of jobs.
0.0	0.374215691195	Our economy -- people are working harder and being left behind.
0.0	0.268916320078	Do you know where I'm going, Kevin?
0.0	0.318131498763	Remember, we have 645 federal agencies and sub-agencies.
0.0	0.655659250828	And I put forth an immigration policy that is as strong in favor of the folks who are struggling in America the most than anybody else.
0.0	0.285557020578	Ted can change his mind.
0.0	0.481880552027	I've told people that from the time I was U.S. attorney 13 years ago.
0.0	0.318061031438	And thirdly, to do more to keep us safe.
0.0	0.252549055782	And what is that proposal?
0.0	0.34534285435	As we speak, there are new problems on the horizon.
0.0	0.677542188416	A 100, 150 years ago incredibly brave Americans said, you know what, working class kids, low income kids should not have to work in factories or on the farms.
0.0	0.341884358186	It's called the mainstream media who every single day...
0.0	0.267043476575	Here is the bottom line.
0.0	0.238871216963	Thank you.
0.0	0.289041204939	So when somebody like Donald Trump and others...
0.0	0.309585374461	We are lowering taxes on small business.
0.0	0.256662986741	... issues they have to respond to.
0.0	0.65818581245	They have to have some legal basis and precedence for being able to follow the law instead of making the law up, and my goal is -- in appointing Supreme Court justices, would be to point -- to appoint justices who would follow the law.
0.0	0.44251914974	They don't believe in building walls and a pessimistic view of the future.
0.0	0.333022383621	...
0.0	0.352317316965	For both of them you have to gradually raise the age.
0.0	0.281991051888	And a lot of people are doing that.
0.0	0.314561923904	Are you fed up with how Washington wastes your money?
0.0	0.336563226164	We increased education funding by 37 percent.
0.0	0.646123527527	At the end of the day, ladies and gentlemen, our best days are ahead of us only if we work together, and I intend to put this country on a path of success by working together and doing the hard things that should have been done a very long time ago.
0.0	0.38099859986	That we work with allies around the world to protect democratic values.
0.0	0.337620140474	23 million files in the hands of the Chinese?
0.0	0.349790988351	We hate all the Muslims, because all of the Muslims are terrorists.
0.0	0.525361676263	The rate -- the rate -- the rate is gonna be much closer to 15 percent.
0.0	0.518369657601	Why does the fossil fuel industry pay -- spend huge amounts of money on campaign contributions?
0.0	0.238871216963	Thank you.
0.0	0.671963744084	You know, after 9/11, one of the efforts that we did in New York was if you see something or hear something suspicious, report it.
0.0	0.677364876859	Yeah, I would encourage people to go on my website, marcorubio.com, and we'll put all the facts up there so people can see it for themselves.
0.0	0.591941867511	Well, I was a conservative governor of Virginia, I governed that way, and that's my track record.
0.0	0.477996344139	But we need to leave the Cold War and that sort of antiquated thinking behind.
0.0	0.280782274451	I've had my issues with Donald Trump.
0.0	0.253836171519	They think they are.
0.0	0.446848203728	And it's available on paperback, if you're interested in buying my book.
0.0	0.270971966814	I was a governor during the 9/11 attack.
0.0	0.267472802852	Look, here is the reality, folks.
0.0	0.580570262865	Yes, we could get rid of Gadhafi, a terrible dictator, but that created a vacuum for ISIS.
0.0	0.64774412838	But it is absolutely fair and necessary for Americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average American family?
0.0	0.611022245168	We need to mobilize the entire country to treat our veterans and treat them with much more respect than they get today.
0.0	0.679600853689	I believe that when real unemployment is close to 10%, and when our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, Flint, Michigan comes to mind.
0.0	0.266906080812	That's true.
0.0	0.292022031826	I'm not using the lobbyists.
0.0	0.579506098336	We need -- we need somebody -- we need somebody that literally will take this country and make it great again.
0.0	0.683513220215	And in my view, what we need to do is put together broad coalitions to understand that we're not going to have a political vacuum filled by terrorists, that, in fact, we are going to move steadily -- and maybe slowly -- toward democratic societies, in terms of Assad, a terrible dictator.
0.0	0.289533267262	We are borrowing money from China today.
0.0	0.474254704712	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government in setting up -- retirement plans.
0.0	0.65918684852	A healthy environment, a strong economy and energy independent America -- that would be the purpose of my presidency, is break the strangle hold that people enjoy on fossil fuels who hate our guts.
0.0	0.631225798125	We don't want to make it seem as though we are turning into a nation of fear instead of a nation of resolve.
0.0	0.333022383621	...
0.0	0.322917768838	Bill, I want to say one more thing about...
0.0	0.682024826159	We need to be the nation whose enduring symbol is the Statue of Liberty, and we need to act like the great country we are, according to our values.
0.0	0.275187646128	You have all of these disastrous airports.
0.0	0.342114216238	No their not.
0.0	0.220361867477	You do the arithmetic.
0.0	0.261837521266	That's the good news.
0.0	0.643633852505	But what happens if, God forbid, the next Barack Obama takes over, and the next Nancy Pelosi, and the next Harry Reid...
0.0	0.301841219234	They are trying to attack us here in America.
0.0	0.276280593276	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.654736207544	And I was determined to do everything that I could to make VA health care the best in the world, to expand benefits to the men and women who put their lives on the line to defending.
0.0	0.642101630776	My proposal is tougher, more effective, and more comprehensive because I go after all of Wall Street not just the big banks.
0.0	0.552105297478	We should use the debt ceiling, as precisely to Don, to force upon them budgetary reforms.
0.0	0.606367803233	And then when we win that, and we will win that against ISIS as it settles down, and we should leave.
1.0	0.695410715152	One, Senator Sanders voted in 1998 on what I think is fair to call a regime change resolution with respect to Iraq, calling for the end of Saddam Hussein's regime.
0.0	0.27892615429	She said the truth.
0.0	0.578618957084	Obviously, I believe that on a college campus, there should be enough respect so people hear each other.
0.0	0.576822056417	Well, when you look at the celebrity of Donald Trump, then I think that says a lot about it.
0.0	0.580641033578	For example, before you hire anyone from abroad, you should have to advertise that job for 180 days.
0.0	0.272479125299	Sure did.
0.0	0.361534832415	I've got a very simple strategy as your president against ISIL.
0.0	0.657578815955	But a great nation like ours should not be in a position where elderly people are cutting their pills in half, where they don't have decent nutrition, where they can't heat their homes in the wintertime.
1.0	0.480137583673	She said that here in Iowa just two days ago.
0.0	0.670114357995	Yeah, again, as I said, we're raising a family in the 21st century and it's one of the reasons why my tax plan is a pro- family tax plan.
0.0	0.42537705774	They told you that your Social Security money is in a trust fund.
0.0	0.654732299739	I'm going to tell you a couple of stories about trade, because I'm totally against the trade bill for a number of reasons.
0.0	0.584328523891	It took -- it took an arm and a leg to be able to set up a 401(k).
0.0	0.533001758422	So I believe that, in fact, this country needs to move towards a living wage.
0.0	0.249878533006	That is the issue.
0.0	0.665912093366	And I used to say it, there are ships at sea, and this was during the worst crisis, that were loaded up with oil, and the cartel kept the price up, because, again, they were smarter than our leaders.
1.0	0.647029353112	In fact, the largest after- tax gains is for the people at the lower end of the tax spectrum under my plan.
0.0	0.260256288955	They don't believe in any of that.
0.0	0.228108833539	...Thank you.
0.0	0.321206750593	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.565458918293	It comes from the right, from the left, from people on all sides of the political spectrum.
0.0	0.67465535604	Because I do believe that we have a history and a tradition, that is part of our values system and we don't want to sacrifice our values.
0.0	0.530935035861	The simple fact is that the plane that's being build here is being sold to China.
0.0	0.238871216963	Thank you.

0.0	0.310794557016	The secretary is right: Our people are fearful.
0.0	0.608586562378	We've got Social Security that's going to be destroyed if somebody like me doesn't bring money into the country.
0.0	0.343823879484	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.261490564716	MACCALLUM: Thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.487834437148	They can't see the government as an adversary, we can't see them as obstructionists.
1.0	0.398039118099	He has called him a disappointment.
0.0	0.283143359908	You've got to bring people together.
0.0	0.281864908257	Well, that's easy to answer.
0.0	0.676809589797	Because so many people in my family worked in steel mills, and they didn't work with a white collar, they worked in a blue collar.
0.0	0.690013164733	The United States was asked to support the Europeans and the Arab partners that we had and we did a lot of due diligence about whether we should or not, and eventually, yes, I recommended and the president decided that we would support the action to protect civilians on the ground and that led to the overthrow of Gadhafi.
0.0	0.418347488359	And with respect to the 2007 bill, this was Ted Kennedy's bill.
0.0	0.281506996527	It is going to be amazingly destructive.
0.0	0.52699057052	I'll tell you, in my family there are a lot of single moms in my family.
0.0	0.675112604852	But the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, it's to understand what happens the day after.
0.0	0.62119289247	That's why we embraced individual liberty, and we became the freest people ever, and the result was the American miracle.
0.0	0.487559408171	And I have to tell you, that was a very insulting statement that Ted made.
0.0	0.321002478268	We can end welfare for those here illegally.
0.0	0.307033282117	If you'll answer the (inaudible) core question.

0.0	0.630006334108	One thing I like to remind people is, back in 2007, Rudy Giuliani was leading the polls for almost a year.
0.0	0.265144270243	That is absolutely inaccurate.
0.0	0.353313096649	Because criminals don't buy their guns from a gun show.
1.0	0.376544445314	We have 400,000 small businesses forming every year in this country.
0.0	0.31332883352	Here's the way you need to deal with it.
0.0	0.388942546672	On two occasions, there were breeches in information two months ago.
0.0	0.646384665475	I will tell you, you could win a bet at a bar tonight, since we're talking about fantasy football, if you ask who the top three states in America are that produce solar energy: California and Arizona are easy, but number three is New Jersey.
0.0	0.642777061354	I think to be commander in chief in the 21st century requires someone who understands how the economy works, someone who understands how the world works and who's in it; I know more world leaders on the stage today than anyone running, with the possible exception of Hillary Clinton; understands bureaucracies, how to cut them down to size and hold them accountable; and understands technology, which is a tool, but it's also a weapon that's being used against us.
0.0	0.380917469861	And, sending mixed signals to kids about drugs is a disaster.
0.0	0.287609045653	This issue touches on two broad issues.
0.0	0.216732400913	I won't be doing that.
0.0	0.267770695485	You're simply not.
0.0	0.288017409415	We have people that aren't smart.
0.0	0.3179150743	I think the American people are look for real leadership.
0.0	0.250227585254	That's a dictatorship.
0.0	0.335875065109	No.
0.0	0.331968557205	... and say there is something more important than money.
0.0	0.651176334363	And after four or five years in Brooklyn, I ventured into Manhattan and did a lot of great deals -- the Grand Hyatt Hotel.
0.0	0.657290028296	I've been held accountable for six years as the governor of New Jersey and with a Democratic legislature, I've gotten conservative things done.
1.0	0.630778007788	All that's in that trust fund is a pile of IOUs for money they spent on something else a long time ago.
0.0	0.29618845668	Terrorism in this country scares everyone.
0.0	0.622131015501	So that's what I'm focused on, that's what I've outlined and that's what I would do as president.
0.0	0.597516902156	But if you want someone to drive you home, I will get the job done and I will get you home.
0.0	0.667524703445	If you send a tie or a shirt made in China into the United States and an American goes to buy it at the store and there's a tariff on it, it gets passed on in the price to price to the consumer.
0.0	0.672511331612	And you've seen a little bit of this emerging in the -- in the African Union and the things that they have done to better stabilize Somalia.
0.0	0.332221018107	We need to do more on the prescribing end of it.
1.0	0.541829487565	Senator Sanders voted to give immunity to gun dealers.
0.0	0.292998571129	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.306768155647	But this is what we also have to say.
0.0	0.523900572416	And the last line standing between them and our families might be us and a gun.
0.0	0.330804900243	Health savings accounts are something that we introduced.
0.0	0.281058626162	You learn to create feedback mechanisms.
0.0	0.274542409495	The formula is working.
0.0	0.36913900856	We reported excessive force, discourtesy, use of lethal force.
0.0	0.659669638727	I stood on the stage and watched Marco in rather indignantly, look at Governor Bush and say, someone told you that because we're running for the same office, that criticizing me will get you to that office.
0.0	0.240279139689	Where are you gonna clean it up?
0.0	0.681225372392	I'm against the kind of inhumane treatment that is now being visited upon families, waking them up in the middle of the night, rounding them up.
0.0	0.273031200886	It only makes common sense.
0.0	0.296641905749	I don't think Ted can have it both ways.
0.0	0.526725395085	And as it relates to all the other organizations, let me give you a good example.
0.0	0.594536219736	If you saw that blimp that got cut loose from Maryland today, it's a perfect example of government.
0.0	0.272271996542	I'll say this.
0.0	0.302921855827	Nobody -- I could stand up here all night.
0.0	0.285450780885	His family certainly believes that.
1.0	0.690647306891	And then in Ohio, of course, I had to bring about big reform, again, because we were so far in the hole and now we just found out we are up over 400,000 jobs since I took over as governor.
0.0	0.411991462262	Let me, you know, again, respectfully disagree with Secretary Clinton here.
0.0	0.646650837441	I'm glad he has produced enormous enthusiasm, and, every Donald Trump voter or potential voter, I hope to earn your support.
0.0	0.314566916558	And I could say, oh, I'm not angry.
0.0	0.673003409212	I know we have a president who wants to do whatever he wants to do, and take his pen and his phone and just tell everybody what he thinks is best.
0.0	0.285812385488	First of all...
0.0	0.5	And in fact, in Obama administration, we did not meet with anybody without conditions.
0.0	0.630218591957	Let me tell you, Donald Trump would be a president every day of the week and twice on Sunday, rather than Hillary.
0.0	0.241081742154	Edward Snowden is a traitor.
0.0	0.57189470242	I think, you know, Rand and I have some significant issues on policy, but I respect Rand.
0.0	0.264479505382	They haven't done that.
0.0	0.337911867749	These are drags on the economy, it's a deliberate drag.
0.0	0.377165145511	I will continue to have tremendous admiration and respect for Governor Bush.
0.0	0.304094398243	Kamatsu (ph) is a tractor company in Japan.
0.0	0.395966444035	The guy who systematically and habitually violates the constitution on the Supreme Court?
0.0	0.675692558057	Here's why, the president of the United States and both his attorney's general, they give the benefit of the doubt to the criminal, not to the police officers.
0.0	0.255894145908	Yeah.
0.0	0.216053226255	There is no other description of it.
0.0	0.269505365277	Yes, it's very simple.
0.0	0.291592198418	So, we have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.62181030452	If it had gone right, believe me, she would have been running around to be able to take credit for it.
0.0	0.482464235228	You know, Obama has presented the American people with a false choice every time.
0.0	0.488869918536	Have a no fly zone in Syria and create safe zones to deal with the refugees.
0.0	0.317620347998	This is what's made our nation so special.
1.0	0.581666641371	We had a $1.4 trillion deficit.
0.0	0.666664274368	But as president, I will spend even more time thinking about the futures of all the kids and the grandchildren in this country because I want to make sure every single child has a chance to live up to his or her God-given potential.
0.0	0.297966649145	They're sending us not the right people.
0.0	0.645720622613	And there is only one person on this stage who voted to take away authority from the SEC and the Commodities Future Trading Commission that they could no longer regulate what are called swaps and derivatives, which actually contributed to the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and that was Senator Sanders.
0.0	0.647306377859	So I not only had the opportunity to go through the Cold War struggles in Central America, and even after 9/11 to be involved.
0.0	0.306015138668	Bill, here's the interesting position on this.
0.0	0.551965032811	That's the kind of coalition we need and that's the kind of coalition I will put together.
0.0	0.285160236021	I've done an amazing job.
0.0	0.242164054584	And that's not what we did in Maryland.
0.0	0.400438626975	You know, before it was called Obamacare, it was called Hillarycare.
0.0	0.272705453333	We need to get realistic about this.
0.0	0.669632051089	You know, all of these politicians that I'm running against now -- it's so nice to say I'm running as opposed to if I run, if I run.
0.0	0.68184859776	We need to take a new approach of taxing -- reforming how we tax, and reforming the regulations in our -- in our country before it's too late.
0.0	0.519815762732	And that's what this economy needs to -- that's what this debate needs to be about.
0.0	0.679035625467	I started off -- thank you -- I started off in a small office with my father in Brooklyn and Queens, and my father said -- and I love my father.
0.0	0.551348142348	But this is what you're seeing in the Republican debate that you didn't see in that Democrat debate.
0.0	0.653534817785	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
1.0	0.692956605462	He wrote a forward for a book that basically argued voters should have buyers' remorse when it comes to President Obama's leadership and legacy.
0.0	0.664633503369	We have a world that's out of control and has grown dangerous and a president that is weakening our military and making our foreign policy unstable and unreliable in the eyes of our allies.
0.0	0.58482253905	I believe if this amendment were to pass, the chances of this bill passing into law would increase dramatically.
0.0	0.583848017745	That's why John McCain, even though he was born in Panama, was eligible to run for president.
0.0	0.379852683832	And we keep young people on our policies until they turn 26.
0.0	0.27872340134	Listen, we can solve immigration.
1.0	0.349536313745	The Republicans have voted to repeal it nearly 60 times.
0.0	0.553536495679	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.287199522525	But actually I am.
0.0	0.460009925201	We need to be on the side that keeps Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.465679131429	Well, the only thing - the only thing I can go on Senator Sanders...
0.0	0.581544913376	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.281767133154	We have a role to play in this world.
0.0	0.631550123991	But let's not -- but let's not -- let's not insult -- let's not insult the intelligence of the American people.
0.0	0.305401204135	It's poor people and middle class.
0.0	0.287184522804	My dad was a bartender, my mother was a maid.

0.0	0.637448479669	Our country deserves no less, because all of the other issues we want to deal with depend upon us being secure and strong.
0.0	0.385025651311	And it's a tax you find in many companies in Europe.
0.0	0.568245117248	What we need to do is destroy their ability to attack us here over there, and then get out.
0.0	0.238769694996	No vision at all.
0.0	0.342114216238	It's not.
0.0	0.471450243358	That is a dramatic tax decrease for hard-working people who run their own businesses.
0.0	0.263840848327	I think he is right.
0.0	0.253062554231	You can't do nothing.
0.0	0.65692804793	And, if this government doesn't pay it, than tell me what's different between the government and Bernie Madolf, who sits in prison today for doing less than what the government has done to the people on social security and Medicare in this country.
0.0	0.678503787166	A lot of the rights that have been won over years, from women's rights to voter rights to gay rights to worker rights, will be at risk.
0.0	0.293937946046	I do not believe in unilateral American action.
0.0	0.590445473473	She wouldn't just be a disaster, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being commander in chief of the United States.
0.0	0.571157702002	Well, we have invested nowhere near what we should be investing in human intelligence on the ground.
0.0	0.65307895413	But I'm not worried about my finances, I'm worried about the finances of everyday Americans who today are struggling in an economy that is not producing good paying jobs while everything else costs more.
0.0	0.658476870339	Our wages are growing faster than the national average, and I've cut taxes more than any sitting governor in this state -- $5 billion, including no taxes on small business and killing the death tax.
0.0	0.226763020674	No, I love them.

0.0	0.684731505682	I think that is the smartest way to be able to move forward because if you go to $12 it would be the highest historical average we've ever had.
0.0	0.48021065596	And there is no reason that you can't be perfectly fair to the gay community.
0.0	0.271068702938	But judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.247360330728	Talk about what?
0.0	0.280832566617	We can develop that, you know?
0.0	0.271600471255	There are thing that can be done.
0.0	0.282969104394	I'm 44 years old.
0.0	0.310098024427	The time to turn the page is now.
0.0	0.673787722642	The only reason why you're doing it now is because we're running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.
1.0	0.688614974465	It absolutely has been, and at the time in the context of that was in 2009, and 2010, where the last effort for legalization was an effort done in the Senate.
0.0	0.404409513166	And we've got to do more on equal pay for equal work.
0.0	0.257784213414	They won't accept it.
0.0	0.571786678264	And that's the difference between somebody who knows how to do this and somebody who's never done it before.
0.0	0.597588711125	I'm very proud that NARAL endorsed me because when it comes to it we need a leader on women's issues.
0.0	0.65244674117	The fact of the matter is -- and let's say it in our debate, because you'll never hear this from that immigration-bashing carnival barker, Donald Trump, the truth of the matter is...
0.0	0.678401529193	Donald, Donald -- can I -- I hope you reconsider this, because this policy is a policy that makes it impossible to build the coalition necessary to take out ISIS.
0.0	0.535825374028	So this is a major epidemic, and it has hit New Hampshire and Vermont particularly hard.
0.0	0.348888564421	I voted for Dodd-Frank, got an important amendment in it.
0.0	0.297758744126	Well, I just want to quickly add...
0.0	0.342642375696	Get rid of the waste and abuse, but save it.
0.0	0.330681570104	I'm going to get a response to that, Neil.
0.0	0.681815200872	We should be deporting criminals, not hardworking immigrant families who do the very best they can and often are keeping economies going in many places in our country.
0.0	0.623099630176	We don't have enough competition and we don't have enough oversight of what the insurance companies are charging everybody right now.
0.0	0.471556841113	This is the unholy alliance that people need to know about between right and left.
0.0	0.303168228026	It has too much economic power.
0.0	0.546900672549	But I would say that if you want to defend the country, it begins with border security.
0.0	0.401226756329	You know, the annual Medicare budget is over $600 billion.
0.0	0.593886986926	They are a sophisticated purveyor of propaganda, a celebrator of violence, an instigator of attacks using their online presence.
0.0	0.276117762731	They are ripping us.
0.0	0.38745946673	But, now for millions of Americans, it's slipping away.
0.0	0.651322047889	If I am president of the United States, we're going to send soldiers back to Iraq, back to Syria, to keep us from being attacked here and keep soldiers in Afghanistan because we must.
0.0	0.5	So -- you know, you shouldn't misrepresent how well you're doing with the polls.
0.0	0.656170666786	You see what the Saudi's -- deliver them a strong message but at the end of the day we have to keep our cool because most of the time they're going right with us.
0.0	0.254154010463	Then (inaudible)...
0.0	0.672217861526	With Saudi Arabia and oil production, first of all, it's so critical for us to be energy independent, and we're getting there because of fracking and we ought to explore because, see, energy independence gives us leverage and flexibility, and secondly, if you want to bring jobs back to the United States of America in industry, low prices make the difference.
0.0	0.350593439832	He's got probably a four or five percent chance.
0.0	0.278626524463	Didn't just happen.
0.0	0.265906345483	That's what the political revolution is about.
0.0	0.647923506996	... the fact is -- the fact is the reason why that no one wants to answer entitlements up here is because it's hard.
0.0	0.57122751153	In fact, I'd love him to leave early and play, that would be a very good thing.
0.0	0.653263091454	And where we are right now is we have got to stand up to the Trumps of the world who are trying to divide us up.
0.0	0.679849009834	I have created tens of thousands of jobs, and I'll be creating many millions of jobs if I'm given -- if I'm given the opportunity to be president.
0.0	0.297250256748	I know how hard it is to build coalitions.
0.0	0.290838441712	And let me say this also.
0.0	0.55330912156	I just hope that by the end of this campaign there will be a lot more supporting me.
0.0	0.472102717726	That is like asking the arsonist to come and pour more gas on the fire.
0.0	0.613149916677	You know how many votes John McCain missed when he was carrying out that furious comeback that you're now modeling after?
0.0	0.237083403237	No, not at all, absolutely not.
0.0	0.427657980243	I think she said something like the bulk of the responsibility is not ours.
0.0	0.333819621685	$5 billion Web site.
0.0	0.567859778136	My tax plan enables you to fill out your taxes on a postcard so we can abolish the IRS.
0.0	0.680631442325	I would sign an executive order protecting religious liberty, our first amendment rights, so Christian business owners and individuals don't face discrimination for having a traditional view of marriage.
0.0	0.284525986234	You know, I have two sons.
0.0	0.310265224364	All of us want equal pay for equal work.
0.0	0.275833296144	It is not because of the tax writeoff.
1.0	0.651739067912	One out of five Americans can't even afford the prescriptions their doctors are writing.
0.0	0.553151686738	It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are.
0.0	0.663586338855	I understand both of these issues, how to build the economy and doing that as a governor who'd built jobs, had cut taxes and also a governor who understands foreign-policy, and that's why I entered this race.
0.0	0.283540182687	Let me get a chance to respond.
1.0	0.653274849103	Fourthly, I work -- look forward to working with Secretary Clinton for an investigation, an independent investigation, about all of the breaches that have occurred from day one in this campaign, because I am not convinced that information from our campaign may not have ended up in her campaign.
0.0	0.519216492234	I visited with a number of our neighbors in Northern Virginia at a mosque last Friday.
0.0	0.295656593733	I am a 2nd amendment person.
0.0	0.678850236747	And number two, if we find out they're developing a nuclear weapon and we know how to get to it, we're gonna go take it out.
0.0	0.24087253442	And so that was his explanation.
0.0	0.291719858464	I want immigration reform to pass.
0.0	0.491564481182	I mean, I heard what they both said, I saw it on the video.
0.0	0.384074279669	We have been debating right here the core difference between conservatism and progressivism.
0.0	0.436243598193	And Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will say it's those evil rich people.
0.0	0.304479303061	Never been done before, never been done since.
0.0	0.361984049702	... No, I said I do not support blanket amnesty...
0.0	0.249055989391	I know how to do that.
0.0	0.259759033314	Fine, I'll take it.
0.0	0.601022964731	And as president I would expand enormous energy, literally call every member of Congress that I thought I could persuade.
0.0	0.299213915166	So, I think gun-free zones are a catastrophe.
1.0	0.486463423907	Senator Sanders voted against the Brady Bill.
0.0	0.643084389725	And this president turns his back -- this president doesn't enforce the marijuana laws in this country because he doesn't agree with them.
0.0	0.268787956322	It is a tragedy all over this country.
0.0	0.512359379921	We will renew America if we work together, and I am totally confident that we will.
0.0	0.538757474234	That very first time they show up with a near miss, we should be intervening there.
0.0	0.351001091529	How do we do it?"
0.0	0.639769000101	Well, first of all, if a company gets caught doing that, they should never be able to use the program again.
0.0	0.418908133358	But much better and much less expensive for people and for the government.
0.0	0.260100298121	I like China.
0.0	0.287331624293	Let me just -- just say this.
0.0	0.253322663698	It's not going to happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.544690401001	I just read today in the New York Times, $250,000 for a 30 second ad.
0.0	0.308217581369	Well, if the law would change, yeah.
0.0	0.258792074297	You know, the situation is this.
0.0	0.670389562162	There is no question in my mind that if we summon our resources, both our leadership resources and all of the tools at our disposal, not just military force, which should be used as a last resort, but our diplomacy, our development aid, law enforcement, sharing of intelligence in a much more open and cooperative way -- that we can bring people together.
0.0	0.529523571697	You come into La Guardia Airport, it's like we're in a third world country.
0.0	0.268606192688	That will be my mission as president.
0.0	0.642471021149	And he led the charge to finally fix this immigration problem that has existed now for, as Marco says, for 30 years.
0.0	0.240995284334	It's what they call it.
0.0	0.36075930758	And I'm not blaming these folks -- but I guess I could.
0.0	0.620338399745	If you want someone who's not going to divide Washington, but gets things done, then you should make me your president.
0.0	0.452949361393	I guess just for the fun of it; they want to throw money around.
0.0	0.528417737957	Yes, they have to stop trying to destabilize the Middle East, causing even more chaos.
0.0	0.64572870166	My plan actually goes further than Senator Sanders because a big chunk of the cost is actually room and board and books and fees.
0.0	0.517946438284	And by the way, I hope we can end the trade embargo with Cuba as well.
0.0	0.268310354117	We listen to you and -- and then we act.
0.0	0.270203293263	You do legislation.
0.0	0.619486134238	We need to use our technological advantages, because what we've warned of is an international guerrilla movement that threatens this country.
1.0	0.435133683779	In the past he has called him weak.
1.0	0.697549926936	If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world -- and we double tax, as you know.
0.0	0.314250579299	You should stick with it and that's exactly what happened.
0.0	0.350389015765	They like General Motors, so they give them a pass.
1.0	0.662927304117	Well, the average small manufacturer, whatever they're manufacturing, drugs or anything, if they have less than 50 employees, the average cost in terms of regulations is $34,000 per employee.
0.0	0.303384147575	What we need to do is destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.29599025844	And, here's the difference between me and Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.645390242012	And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, because I've been a leader on these issues.
0.0	0.281848656334	I have a comprehensive, tough plan.
0.0	0.300828667321	Nothing has to change for current beneficiaries.
0.0	0.552375184353	And I spent my entire lifetime balancing federal budgets, growing jobs, the same in Ohio.
0.0	0.329444869277	That's the difference between China's leaders and our leaders.
0.0	0.252729047771	I will do that.
0.0	0.281589921087	But we are where we are right now.
0.0	0.655298139211	Now, the whole region has been rendered unstable, in part because of the aftermath of the Arab Spring, in part because of the very effective outreach and propagandizing that ISIS and other terrorist groups do.
0.0	0.244861988249	It's Hillary Clinton.
1.0	0.639894302003	She wants to put Barack Obama on the Supreme Court of the United States of America.
0.0	0.285135932252	Let me conclude by just saying this.
0.0	0.654214837886	And one of the reasons in some states why the percentage cost has gone up so much is because governors there would not extend Medicaid.
0.0	0.427931995847	And at the end of the day, it was the president's decision.
0.0	0.608843939936	None of these instances that the president points to as the reason why he's doing these things would have been preventive.
0.0	0.453442892338	My sister was a single mom, both of my aunts who were a single moms.
0.0	0.505775771039	Well, let me first describe Iran because they're not just a normal nation state.
0.0	0.327531966052	So the total is $8,737,540,00.
0.0	0.300455758612	This is our time and our opportunity to do that.
0.0	0.303589176706	We don't need newer (ph) laws.
0.0	0.301809063729	And some, I assume, are good people.
0.0	0.647173866419	That's the side we need to be on, and that's the side of the bulk of the -- of the Middle East.
0.0	0.272360799065	We just can't do it any longer.
0.0	0.246561920048	I will not do that.
0.0	0.572710668411	Oz Guinness, the theologian, said that liberty requires restraint but the only restraint consistent with liberty is self-restraint.
0.0	0.26048105618	Think about it.
0.0	0.680441694303	I believe that when we have some 300 million guns in this country, I believe that when we have seen these horrific mass killings, not only in San Bernardino, but in Colorado and movie theaters in Colorado, I think we have got to bring together the vast majority of the people who do in fact believe in sensible gun safety regulations.
0.0	0.274654386261	... Chris, keep it coming...
1.0	0.639973985897	In this case, our staff did the wrong thing -- they looked a that information.
0.0	0.566214349402	Well, I don't know if it's a blind trust if Ivanka, Don and Eric run it.
0.0	0.483366389247	... the best results, wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.607482844914	And if we can do that in Texas, that 12th largest economy in the world, we can do it in America.
0.0	0.286913598555	We're going to create a border.
0.0	0.573853142786	And that is that one of the things you're watching tonight are 11 quality candidates debating an important issue.
0.0	0.655462627007	And you wanted to know the numbers, the Tax Foundation, which has scored every one of our plans, shows that this plan will allow the economy to generate 4.9 million jobs, to raise wages over 12 percent, and to generate 14 percent growth.
0.0	0.685341750954	A flat tax for everybody -- no exemptions, no deductions, no shelters, because some people have a better capability of taking advantage of those than others.
0.0	0.419122298798	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.65647048633	I want to find out why those two young people -- those two horrible young people in California when they shot the 14 people, killed them -- people they knew, people that held the wedding reception for them.
0.0	0.5	Number two, I'm a private company, so nobody knows what I'm worth.
0.0	0.258230267199	A step forward.
0.0	0.64446046864	And I would hope in the midst of all of this discussion, this country makes certain that we do not turn our backs on the men and women who put their lives on the line to defend us, and that we stand with them as they have stood with us.
0.0	0.655558611981	Do you remember when he ran for president of the United States, and he was a candidate, and he went and said, "These Americans with traditional values, they are bitter people, and they cling to their guns and to their religion."
0.0	0.686705313363	And what I believe right now, and I believe this is terribly important, is the United States of America cannot succeed, or be thought of as the policeman of the world, that when there's an international crisis all over the world, in France and in the U.K. Or -- hey, just call up the American military and the American taxpayers, they're going to send the troops.
0.0	0.268134712484	Hillary Clinton cannot be president.
0.0	0.574670364511	They will never again support it, and that's wrong for our country, bad for our future.
0.0	0.267087233129	I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.681015642294	So if you're having Medicare for all, single-payer, you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing.
0.0	0.659587927754	And I can do it without raising the debt, without raising taxes on the middle class and making it reasonably manageable within our budget so that we can be fiscally responsible at the same time.
0.0	0.272022977052	You've heard some of those tonight.
0.0	0.666497488324	States need to stop cutting higher education, and we should create a new block grant program that keeps the states' skin in the game, and we should lower these outrageous interest rates that parents and kids are being charged by their own government.
0.0	0.542368735188	According to the generals that I know and trust, this air campaign will not destroy ISIL.
0.0	0.512877200814	So I just truly, with all my heart belief, I like everybody on the stage.
0.0	0.677371480185	In terms of Wall Street, I respectfully disagree with you, madam secretary, in the sense that the issue here is when you have such incredible power and such incredible wealth.
0.0	0.5	Guns, in and of themselves, in my opinion, will not make Americans safer.
0.0	0.653063267812	You know, you go to the internet, you start reading an article and you go to the comments section -- you cannot go five comments down before people are calling each all manner of names.
0.0	0.650926747102	It was a company that had grown into a bloated, inept bureaucracy that cost too much and delivered too little to customers and shareholders.
0.0	0.329486585201	Maria, Neil, thank you for a great debate tonight.
0.0	0.460775998909	... and that's what you and others can start providing in the Senate.
1.0	0.378780171153	And our real unemployment is anywhere from 18 to 20 percent.
0.0	0.434405080084	And, I can tell, some of the candidates, they went in.
0.0	0.654839986746	Our friends no longer think we have their back and our enemies no longer fear us, and we're in a much difficult -- we're in a much different position than we should be.
0.0	0.682277703487	As a result of his efforts and the efforts of Joe Biden against unprecedented, I was there in the Senate, unprecedented Republican obstructionism, we have made enormous progress.
0.0	0.294355015038	to save a company.
0.0	0.282536083291	We say "we're gonna protect."
0.0	0.275027539552	It's extraordinarily wrong.
0.0	0.44256653669	You know, I find it really quite fascinating some of the president's proclamations.
0.0	0.659859077466	As a former mayor and a former governor, there was never a single day, John, when I went to bed or woke up without realizing that this could happen in our own country.
0.0	0.251064798043	How are we going to do this?
0.0	0.682990932061	Well, there is no question that some people go overboard when it comes to trying to make profits, and they don't take into consideration the American people.
0.0	0.238871216963	Thank you.
0.0	0.663695086816	And, the reality of it is this, it is unfair to the people that have legally entered this country to create an alternative for individuals who entered illegally, and knowingly did so.
0.0	0.432085038883	We get Bergdahl, they get five killer terrorists that everybody wanted over there.
0.0	0.650228803409	So, we're going to enforce the law, we're going to change policing practices, we're going to change incarceration practices, but we're also going to emphasize education, jobs, and housing.
0.0	0.322228256135	And by those standards, we're not doing particularly well.
0.0	0.626468868157	And by the way, as important as those two phone calls are, they are also very important because they say this.
0.0	0.395698813316	And it was with us for months, the smell, the air.
0.0	0.374837673372	What you have now is a very dangerous moment in American history.
0.0	0.643391769804	He's been a good governor, and he's a heck of a lot better than his predecessor that would have bankrupted New Jersey.
0.0	0.277374746396	Washington is broken.
0.0	0.686161725898	It would just -- you absolutely have to get involved with China, they are taking so much of what we have in terms of jobs in terms of money.
0.0	0.27725938935	This is a remarkable and horrifying fact.
0.0	0.53072738366	You find me a Democrat -- you find me a Democrat that will cut spending ten dollars?
1.0	0.605542465543	In 1988, I lost an election because I said we should not have assault weapons on the streets of America.
0.0	0.263047524986	There was nothing to this birther issue.
0.0	0.40739681549	The issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24 months ago.
1.0	0.645876643574	And Senator Sanders voted against even research dollars to look into this public health issue.
0.0	0.687861411625	It's one of 15 strategic goals I've set out to make our country a better place by cutting these sort of deaths in half in the next five years.
1.0	0.329352353762	And, that's with zero percent interest rates.
0.0	0.603764132261	The fact is if we don't address what's costing so much, we can't throw enough money at this.
0.0	0.5	For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses closing than starting.
0.0	0.249754884389	They're not so stupid.
0.0	0.288202190642	And it's just not going to work.
0.0	0.677450403624	But like all of our problems, there isn't a single one that can't be solved with common sense if you remove the ego and the politics.
0.0	0.656524702836	We shouldn't have the war fighters have their arms tied behind their back as President Obama wanted to do, but they had a chance to show support and it wasn't popular at the time.
0.0	0.668525710534	I don't know if any of us could have done what they did, one after another, within 48 hours of that tragedy taking place.
0.0	0.67762315266	And let me be clear: While there are some great corporations creating jobs and trying to do the right thing, in my view -- and I say this very seriously -- the greed of the billionaire class, the greed of Wall Street is destroying this economy and is destroying the lives of millions of Americans.
0.0	0.585083927927	Now, I'm the only person that's put out a detailed plan on how to deal with entitlements.
0.0	0.551947335607	For example, all right, who in America denies that we have an infrastructure that is crumbling?
0.0	0.554618062299	It's the only way to level the playing field between big and powerful and small and powerless.
0.0	0.506071202933	We have to stop contributing to the creation of vacuums that allow safe havens to develop.
0.0	0.273061697673	There's a lot packed into that statement.
0.0	0.296785288383	Two points.
0.0	0.612230371124	Crony capitalism is what happens when government gets so big and so powerful that only the big and the powerful can handle it.
0.0	0.421599560008	I'm all about making sure we actually get results for whatever we do.
0.0	0.282104270435	I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King.

0.0	0.315748155572	We got $18 trillion in debt.
0.0	0.262263980457	Look--
0.0	0.639579151426	And when we -- and when we do that, we don't do what the Republicans want, which is to cut Social Security.
0.0	0.378388717153	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.508601123616	We can get back in the game to restore order and security for our own country.
0.0	0.527543914155	And remember, the Russians have not gone after ISIS or any of the other terrorist groups.
0.0	0.667064497187	What's happening in Syria and Iraq is that, because of the failures in the region, including the failure of the prior government in Baghdad, led by Maliki, there has been a resurgence of Sunni activities, as exemplified by ISIS.
0.0	0.578532154654	And, they're always going to say, "Well, we're going to fix this one day."
0.0	0.360088492385	We have -- I don't know that there's any disagreement here...
0.0	0.591489623295	And I went there, and for 16 years, I fought the insiders and was able to get things done.
0.0	0.331289433972	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
1.0	0.667484221068	Everybody voted for it wanting to see Libya move toward democracy, of course we all wanted to do that.
0.0	0.336121078615	Let me just add one thing about ISIS over there.
0.0	0.679471270878	We need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources, but from sources overseas, that can be a real-time fusion effort to get information where it's needed.
0.0	0.266769691181	It's great to be back.
0.0	0.48996178176	And the Obama-Clinton economy has left behind the working men and women of this country.
0.0	0.422679009464	We'll hire 20,000 new border agents instead of 20,000 new IRS agents.
0.0	0.250036611431	So it is difficult.
0.0	0.684219069216	And we won't be using a man like Secretary Kerry that has absolutely no concept of negotiation, who's making a horrible and laughable deal, who's just being tapped along as they make weapons right now, and then goes into a bicycle race at 72 years old, and falls and breaks his leg.
0.0	0.2771463367	I do not think it would come to that.
0.0	0.296175750755	We came back from the dead.
0.0	0.270203712824	He consistently underestimates it but I do not.
0.0	0.361577881334	And I promise I will never be in a bicycle race.
0.0	0.25287149219	Looking forward to it.
0.0	0.67064393458	We have arrived at a point in our nation's history where the potential of this nation and too many Americans is being crushed by the weight, the power, the cost, the complexity, the ineptitude, the corruption of the federal government, and only someone who will challenge the status quo of Washington, D.C. can lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.263692502502	I used the tithing analogy.
1.0	0.410618744838	And the overall message is that it doesn't result in job loss.
0.0	0.596291174634	Let me tell you that, in this country -- in this country, people are concerned about their economic future.
0.0	0.305634897573	So I have nothing at all critical of him.
0.0	0.245356101315	No, I think they won't.
0.0	0.647628042642	And this deal is giving him a pathway to a bomb, a missile to deliver it, and money to pay for it all.
0.0	0.581264467499	You've got to be able to bring together conservatives and evangelicals and libertarians, and stitch together a winning majority.
0.0	0.286297297584	He wasn't a cheerleader; he was the opposite.
0.0	0.594300511986	The B-52 is still operational as the long range bomber; it was inaugurated in the age of Harry Truman.
0.0	0.245672245561	We don't want to be Sweden.

0.0	0.664262357579	And if at the end of 18 months, 24 months there are people who have been cleared, and I would prioritize widows, and orphans, and the elderly, people who may have relatives, families, or have nowhere else to go.
0.0	0.67837183781	And so in no way have I ever said that I don't embrace my father or love my father or appreciate everything that he has done for the country.
0.0	0.229286164186	She was a great CEO.
1.0	0.40290318642	Well, we have an authorization to use military force against terrorists.
0.0	0.266442655828	He didn't know.
0.0	0.317918308021	Now, since September, the Constitution hasn't changed.
0.0	0.658732779336	So while other candidates will talk about the things they would like to do, I actually got these things done in a state that defended not only a AAA bond rating, but the highest median income in America.
0.0	0.458534579874	I do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination to succeed President Obama.
0.0	0.650135363853	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.271855144352	We're running.
0.0	0.645862303764	One thing I discovered in Ferguson was that a third of the budget for the city of Ferguson was being reaped by civil fines.
0.0	0.653100296016	And I'm the only candidate on this stage to put forward a new agenda for America's cities so we can employ more people in the heart of great American cities and get them back to work.
0.0	0.54984323025	I don't think it's so much about when the government orders a corporation to do something.
0.0	0.449084300748	Here's my promise-- Wall Street representatives will not be in my cabinet.
0.0	0.249578528041	He was on the board.
0.0	0.560781895672	I sell apartments for -- I just sold an apartment for $15 million to somebody from China.

0.0	0.572036453554	I don't know and with all due respect to the secretary, Wall Street played by the rules?
1.0	0.379850408166	And I have liabilities of about $500 million (ph).
0.0	0.302739918907	It -- it doesn't need to be that way.
0.0	0.672638369311	And not only did I fight them and win, I lived to tell about it and I'm standing on this stage tonight as evidence of that.
0.0	0.284368183076	My name was invoked.
0.0	0.523884499605	Look, here's the deal, in this particular case, the FBI made a mistake.
0.0	0.576760512621	And what I'm talking about is not only the covert CIA intelligence, I'm also talking about diplomatic intelligence.
1.0	0.62238438231	And I have assets -- big accounting firm, one of the most highly respected -- 9 billion 240 million dollars.
0.0	0.305257283335	And she turned around many lives.
0.0	0.551021824386	We need fundamental police reform, clearly, clearly, when we talk about a criminal justice system.
0.0	0.595098174066	And, there is no one on this stage better prepared to prosecute the case against Hillary Clinton than I am.
0.0	0.255151160361	I am the son and grandson of immigrants.
0.0	0.261840201173	He's a gifted politician.
0.0	0.67616772854	So I think, at a time when so many of our kids are desperately looking for constructive activity, where too many of our kids are hanging around on street corners, potentially getting into trouble, I think we need a forceful advocate for the children, for teenagers, for the little children, to deal with the dysfunctional child care system, and I think my wife would do a great job in helping me accomplish those goals.
0.0	0.561505482454	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.268595902612	That is absolutely not right.
0.0	0.332261715106	Community- based businesses and farms are getting crushed.
0.0	0.219384272876	So be very, very careful.
0.0	0.271067434397	We have to find out what's going on.
0.0	0.292963443915	Well, this is what I would say.
0.0	0.674833449762	But as Bill said earlier, Roe v. Wade, it's has been the law for 42 years, and I don't think we should continue to try to change it.
0.0	0.581142742533	And of course, it has to be de-conflicted with the Russians, who are also flying in that space.
0.0	0.529034679076	But I know the negotiators in the world, and I put them one for each country.
0.0	0.599624577232	...incentives for people to keep people healthy, rather than giving the incentives to treat them when they're sick?
0.0	0.616540224282	They shouldn't automatically assume that because you believe that marriage is between one man and one woman that you are a homophobe.
1.0	0.695409022812	Secretary Clinton changes her position on this every election year, it seems, having one position in 2000 and then campaigning against President Obama and saying we don't need federal standards.
0.0	0.268078155717	I understand.
0.0	0.417110384675	That's a part of the problem and I am going right at them.
0.0	0.5	That is why we need to make police -- and I speak as a former mayor.
0.0	0.30010042868	They can provide forces.
0.0	0.5	It's the only way you fix Medicare, the only way you fix Social Security.
0.0	0.668043102044	And the thing is, she can't be a champion of women's rights at the same time she's got this that is always lurking out there, this type of behavior.
0.0	0.443314550905	O' Malley: John, please, it's-- personal privilege, John.
0.0	0.469204133228	We owned a liquor store, restaurant, bar and we lived in the back.
0.0	0.630931480615	I think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether it's poison in the water of the children of Flint, or whether it's the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the LGBT community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, that's what I want to take on.
1.0	0.604183654635	In 2008, Barack Obama missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes, and the same newspaper endorsed him again.
1.0	0.584646914154	Last week, I read 2,300 Humvees -- these are big vehicles -- were left behind for the enemy.
0.0	0.677809823366	We actually raised it to the highest goals of any state in the nation also in minority and women participant goals because we understood that the way you reinvigorate and make fair market American capitalism work, is to make the choices and the investments that include more people more full in the economic success of your state.
0.0	0.674882837346	And if you want to know who's telling the truth, you should look and ask people like Jeff Sessions and Steve King and Rush Limbaugh and Mark Levin, all of whom say, as Jeff Sessions said, responding to these false attacks just recently in Alabama -- he said, "if it wasn't for Ted Cruz, the Gang of Eight Rubio/Schumer bill would have passed.
0.0	0.274789620847	Of course, you would.
0.0	0.68327151086	So if we want to pick and choose -- and I certainly do -- people I listen to, people I don't listen to, people I listen to for certain areas, then I think we have to be fair and look at the entire world, because it's a big, complicated world out there.
0.0	0.63309915596	So we've got to look at the full range and then come to some smart decisions about having more streamlined and focused approach.
0.0	0.274907618375	When did we beat Japan at anything?
0.0	0.269814893706	There are no simple solutions.
0.0	0.679788003579	But at the end of the day, what you have right now are millions of Americans working two or three jobs because their wages that they are earning are just too low.
0.0	0.370928026655	... that he tried to take credit for four years later.
0.0	0.682009694298	I have talked to some of the young kids with tears rolling down their cheeks, are scared to death that today they may or their parents may be deported.

0.0	0.413831034759	Mine gives every American a simple, flat tax of 10 percent.
0.0	0.578190708239	Putting Iranian troops right on the border of the Golan right next to Israel would be a nonstarter for me.
0.0	0.506594517703	We need to tell folks who want to come here, they need to come here legally.
0.0	0.26705280387	But it's a lot safer.
0.0	0.296513267768	Barack Obama was never responsible for those decisions.
0.0	0.618185923032	And it was even reported incorrectly yesterday, because they said, "He had assets of $9 billion."
0.0	0.292062353858	The problem is we never get it done.
0.0	0.28089484597	There's no way he launches 11 attack --
0.0	0.452873514134	And I'll tell you what I'm worried about -- I'm worried about money.
0.0	0.270308405089	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.677589912521	We need to control the border, we need to do all of this in a comprehensive way, not just going back and forth and talking about stuff --
0.0	0.363762714298	That is the thing that obviously makes sense, we can do that.
0.0	0.308588964567	Let's quit making it a problem for them.
0.0	0.282871097834	But the president leads in this regard.
0.0	0.255894037166	It won't happen.
0.0	0.280022472434	Nobody.
0.0	0.274042374257	I'd consider it.
0.0	0.671298904538	... and I encourage everybody watching this tonight to please, acknowledge that by going online at martinomalley.com and help me wage this campaign for real American capitalism.
0.0	0.371357430037	We have people that are selling this country down the drain.
0.0	0.506858406118	And then he cut and run because it wasn't popular amongst conservatives, I guess.
0.0	0.468089626794	They are doing everything they can to prevent the voices of Americans to be heard.
0.0	0.27955618354	Think back to Garland, Texas.
0.0	0.238871216963	Thank you.
0.0	0.68503563967	But I do hope that in years to come, just as occurred with Cuba, 10, 20 years ago, people would say, reach normalized relations with Cuba.
0.0	0.251387387025	See, here's the thing.
0.0	0.411233500587	... against Islam -- radical Islam -- if you're not for border security.
0.0	0.287969458547	That's the right of people.
0.0	0.321167615771	And we're going to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	0.671574224733	I will cut this government down to size and hold it accountable, simplify the tax code, roll back the regulations that have been spewing out of Washington, D.C. for 50 years.
0.0	0.643894265596	I plead that it's very difficult when you deal with ISIS and organizations like that whose behavior is so barbaric and so vicious that it doesn't seem to have any purpose other than lust for killing and power and that's very difficult to put ourselves in the other shoe.
0.0	0.377389834547	The truth is that sentencing for blacks is higher than for whites.
0.0	0.268239087538	I'm going to tell you -- thank you.
0.0	0.291470006321	He hit oil.
0.0	0.417014234184	When you became president, you had a Democratic Congress and a filibuster-proof Democratic Senate.
0.0	0.611711043248	Well, thank you very much to CBS and everyone here this evening for giving us another chance to appear before you.
0.0	0.654853972818	You know, I recently met with a group of mothers who lost their children to either killings by police or random killings in their neighborhoods, and hearing their stories was so incredibly, profoundly heartbreaking.
0.0	0.505068158622	They have children who are doing so well, I've met and worked with dreamers.
0.0	0.646167073549	And then, after the war, this is the guy who, in fact, yes, you're right, he opened up relations with China, and now pushed various type of trade agreements, resulting in American workers losing their jobs as corporations moved to China.
0.0	0.636949173202	All of a sudden, at the last moment, this big car manufacturer, foreign, announces they're not going to Tennessee.
0.0	0.239844347088	Kathie, I think -- Kathie the...
0.0	0.310756238492	Now that he is, he's changed his tune.
0.0	0.578548286768	You know, a lot of business activity in America is conducted like the guy that does my dry cleaning.
0.0	0.295627174164	It's not fear and terror, it's reality.
0.0	0.302799438314	And I do carry on occasion, sometimes a lot.
0.0	0.291825570624	Because -- because Donald's mother was born in Scotland.
0.0	0.62663075009	Well, first, let's remember why we became part of a coalition to stop Gadhafi from committing massacres against his people.
0.0	0.510275391215	ON the other side, you have so many Republicans, and what do they care about?
0.0	0.277083088708	The Cold War is over.
0.0	0.617202138042	Here at home, we've got to do a better job coordinating between federal, state, and local law enforcement.
1.0	0.673731939154	They would give more tax breaks to the super-wealthy and corporations, not to the middle class.
0.0	0.565128079769	They're saying, "Dad, you're going to do something that's going to be so tough."
0.0	0.655545009592	And I'm going to do everything I can to address distressed communities, whether they are communities of color, whether they are white communities, whether they are in any part of our country.
0.0	0.65288998858	At the end of the day, the legal issue is quite straightforward, but I would note that the birther theories that Donald has been relying on -- some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on U.S. soil, but have two parents born on U.S. soil.
0.0	0.623397423813	I would give up some Social Security to save a system that Americans are going to depend on now and in the future.
0.0	0.283264734455	They don't know how to bring it about.
0.0	0.262062591167	We have not provided them.
0.0	0.321707698976	So I think secretary Clinton and I have a fundamental disagreement.
0.0	0.566402738949	OK. You know, the Democrats who have the ultimate super PAC, it's called the mainstream media.
0.0	0.276366106596	Yes.
0.0	0.5	And I have a road map and a plan right now to get us to balance.
0.0	0.655208705872	And, I would not that there's a much more important government regulation to ethanol, and that's the EPA's blend wall that makes it illegal to sell mid-level blends of ethanol in gasoline.
0.0	0.346499303917	I'm deadly serious about doing this job the right way.
0.0	0.268871500052	... who got us out of that...
0.0	0.650216419894	Against the Republican leadership, who all thought it would be a great idea to merge investor banks and commercial banks and large insurance companies.
0.0	0.37555342548	And I'm delighted to be here in New Hampshire for this debate.
0.0	0.267002832665	I don't blame Hillary Clinton at all for this.
0.0	0.275804006389	I am advocating...
1.0	0.292553250169	It's never below zero.
0.0	0.683406324339	You look at the kind of damage that two people that two people that got married, they were radicalized -- they got married, they killed 15 people in actually 15 -- going to be probably 16 but you look at that and you take a look -- a good strong look and that's what we have.
0.0	0.658680077371	One of the great challenges that we have, $150 billion is fixing to go to a country that killed our Marines in Lebanon, that used their weapons to kill our young men in Iran.
0.0	0.681528447879	We actually took action to do these things and as president, I have put forward 15 strategic goals that will make wages go up again for all American families.

0.0	0.2580004821	And God bless America.
0.0	0.280336728816	That's the secondary issue.

0.0	0.27931842735	I know, Bret.
0.0	0.249647636773	You can't have a question.
0.0	0.669408190784	So we've got some real work to do, and let's try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the Russians.
0.0	0.255929037699	And I'm confident we can do that.
0.0	0.356536288797	And, yes, we are at war with those people.
0.0	0.555085524795	I think they made the Second Amendment the second amendment because they thought it was just that important.
0.0	0.279207567857	Where did that spirit come from in America?
0.0	0.285627604797	I voted yes to suspend that.
0.0	0.663051290251	But they all said, a lot of the pundits on television, "Well, Donald will never run, and one of the main reasons is he's private and he's probably not as successful as everybody thinks."
0.0	0.255285888083	We serve you.
0.0	0.676393446114	If the proponents of this bill actually demonstrate a commitment not to politics, not to campaigning all the time, but to actually fixing this problem, to finding a middle ground.

0.0	0.448663087378	No, because if you look at the quote, and it's very specific.
0.0	0.368774694204	You know, I've supported legislation to allow body cameras.
0.0	0.608483333738	And specifically said to Wall Street, that what they were doing in the mortgage market was bringing our country down.
0.0	0.513271709684	If the American people see us granting amnesty they will never again believe in legal immigration.
0.0	0.55113055887	And let me just say a word about coalition-building, because I've heard Senator Sanders say this.
0.0	0.270241045565	Absolutely.
0.0	0.5	We took it away from the NSA, it was a bad decision by the president.
0.0	0.643452377799	And my reading of the law and the Constitution convinces me that the President has the authority that he is attempting to exercise with respect to dreamers and their parents, because I think all of us on this stage agree that we need comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.380943298661	I want to see us do away with the gun show loophole.
0.0	0.267260123943	I mean, you know...
0.0	0.283635690993	Let's reverse the immunity.
0.0	0.657777898612	Now, there is a difference between personal insults and attacks -- between going into the mud with ad hominems and focusing on issues and substance.
0.0	0.265656686084	And Martha...
0.0	0.527034882155	But their leaders are much smarter than our leaders, and we can't sustain ourself with that.
0.0	0.588006528227	We're a country of laws, not of men, not of people who do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.659162027445	I'm running because we need to address the planetary crisis of climate change and take on the fossil fuel industry and transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy.
0.0	0.384785338385	I was the governor during the 9/11 attack when the Pentagon was struck.
0.0	0.276801834181	It's not that complicated actually.
0.0	0.68850208735	Look, I don't believe there's the model -- there's lots of good people that work in finance, Secretary Sanders, but Secretary Clinton, we need to step up and we need to protect Main Street from Wall Street and you can't do that by -- by campaigning as the candidate of Wall Street.
0.0	0.675036704228	But I also understand, when a law enforcement official charged with the responsibility of preventing attacks -- to go back to our early questions, how do we prevent attacks -- well, if we can't know what someone is planning, we are going to have to rely on the neighbor or, you know, the member of the mosque or the teacher, somebody to see something.
0.0	0.584889504783	Yeah, we can create 13 million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure at a cost of a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.273970111224	I believe it is a right.
0.0	0.58887056554	They don't like somebody else like David Petraeus, they prosecute them and send a decorated general on to disgrace.

0.0	0.661444587518	I would hope that, given the extraordinary capacities that the tech community has and the legitimate needs and questions from law enforcement, that there could be a Manhattan-like project, something that would bring the government and the tech communities together to see they're not adversaries, they've got to be partners.
0.0	0.638692329073	And all over New Hampshire, I met grandmothers who are raising children because they lost the father or the mother to an overdose.
0.0	0.681854569582	And remember this, after Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have had nearly 8 years, we have fewer democracies in the world than we had when they started.
0.0	0.655106408157	I don't think you expand entitlements when so many people are dependent on government and when the money the federal government is offering is going to be taken away from you after just a couple of years.
0.0	0.264378311796	I know this, I certainly am.
0.0	0.663579699312	If I could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited.
0.0	0.643601494507	And recognizing that it's so important, this election, because we're talking about America for the people versus America for the government.
0.0	0.572123440246	Fred Thompson was the other one, a man who had spent a lot of time on that screen.
0.0	0.661723182986	We can put America back on track on a growth level and a growth rate that we've never seen in the history of this country.

1.0	0.416353751083	Right now, think of this: We owe China $1.3 trillion.
0.0	0.533606876156	I know there have been people who have been fired; people who are being held accountable.
0.0	0.655404684064	I have a strategy to combat and defeat ISIS without getting us involved in another ground war, and I have plans to raise incomes and deal with a lot of the problems that keep families up at night.

0.0	0.313007916269	This is an interesting point when you talk about immigration.
0.0	0.514397804081	And I think this has become something that needs to be looked at in terms of regulation.
0.0	0.447340710396	Well, John, I come from the '60s, a long time ago.
0.0	0.5	We need a leader that will fix things and have a proven record to do it.

0.0	0.664813981819	And what you'll find is that I led -- helped lead the effort as a member of the House financial committee against Alan Greenspan, against a guy named Bill Clinton, maybe you know him, maybe you don't.
0.0	0.375162003124	Number one, our goal is to crush and destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.648427714821	It is not a radical idea to say that if somebody works 40 hours a week, that person should not be living in poverty.
0.0	0.539805560901	He doesn't want to hear the talk about politics Megyn and who is establishment and who is grassroots.
0.0	0.520895111419	I have -- look, I would agree with much of what Senator Sanders says, Kevin.
0.0	0.682975034835	The only way to figure that out is to go back to getting the intelligence community the funding and the tools that it needs to be able to keep America safe.
0.0	0.277445743176	But here's the real key.
0.0	0.451381682908	They're building a military island in the middle of the South China sea.
0.0	0.415499368267	Now, once that is done, everyone agrees we need healthcare reform.
0.0	0.295495473603	... we will secure the border...
0.0	0.669415716515	Because in the end, my goal is not simply to live on this earth for 80 years, but to live an eternity with my creator.
0.0	0.27220318193	They're never going to let it happen.
1.0	0.661765963655	You know, the amendment you're talking about is one sentence -- it's 38 words.
0.0	0.422781201295	I have the largest bank in the world as a tenant of mine.
0.0	0.297528383879	We need money.
1.0	0.680547411654	We pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.
0.0	0.553536495679	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.315447016387	They understand that there's a national security risk.
0.0	0.576455458215	So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States.
0.0	0.276366106596	Yes.
0.0	0.600060880449	No, I oppose it because you're taking money from the entitlement and then spending it immediately on other items.
0.0	0.468391517569	We just heard that most families haven't had a wage increase since 2001.
1.0	0.679414644371	But I want to -- I want to follow up on something having to do with leadership, because, you know, today Senator Sanders said that President Obama failed the presidential leadership test.
0.0	0.383735251371	No, it speaks to the fact that I don't know those --
0.0	0.668401470426	No, what I would say is this is look, I was the first of the three of us to call for America to accept the 65,000 refugees we were asked to accept.
0.0	0.238871216963	Thank you.
0.0	0.296122876113	People were shocked, Trump got it.
0.0	0.669204803361	And so if there's someone in that organization, and it turns out there was, who was willing to be able to do that, that's what we should do.
0.0	0.290953566946	We both made the identical promises.
0.0	0.261588465669	That is not right.
0.0	0.6456807186	Chris, in 1981, when Ronald Reagan came to the Oval Office, he encountered a military that had been debilitated just as the current military has, just like Jimmy Carter weakened our readiness, undermined our ability to defend this country, so too has Barack Obama.
0.0	0.32147424264	Two weeks later, the place was blown up.
0.0	0.671493420176	And I will pay for it by, yes, taxing the wealthy more, closing corporate loopholes, deductions, and other kinds of favorable treatment.
0.0	0.556668179902	We're talking about a state that moved graduation rates forward from 27th in the nation to second-highest.
0.0	0.663144000602	I would want us to take our place among the nations of the world to alleviate this sort of death and the specter we saw of little kids' bodies washing up on a beach.
0.0	0.30191589731	Eleven points, to be exact.
0.0	0.290190505639	I'll give you another example.
0.0	0.309072938622	Well, I think that there are different records.
0.0	0.599634969708	But I know that we offered a lot of help and I know it was difficult for the Libyans to accept help.
0.0	0.645371679232	So I'm going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of Americans fulfilling their potential, because I don't think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single American to live up to theirs.
0.0	0.669980833894	I will do everything I can to make certain that the United States and our brave men and women in the military do not get bogged down in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.
0.0	0.56567194964	I am convinced that this president, if he could get rid of the Second Amendment, he would.
0.0	0.299490926032	We need to deal with ISIS in the caliphate.
0.0	0.656468288466	Well, first, the most important job of being president is obviously to keep our country safe and to keep the families of America safe.
0.0	0.302614923073	But I did want to -- I wanted to follow up.
0.0	0.223044622534	... an agreement with the...
0.0	0.372190136993	All these other people want to cut the hell out of it.
0.0	0.282839277863	That's not even an issue.
0.0	0.654370823811	... the fact is, Neil, let's think about -- let's think about -- and I want to maybe -- I hope the president is watching tonight, because here's what I'd like to tell him.
0.0	0.299480823122	He just writes out an executive order.
0.0	0.214346147021	No, they shouldn't.
0.0	0.660341695605	And if I am elected president, to every soldier and sailor and airman and marine, and to every police officer and firefighter and first responder who risk their lives to keep us safe, I will have your back.
0.0	0.263663465091	Yes, I'm getting...
0.0	0.64578832483	But in terms of shutting down the government, I don't think President Obama should choose to shut down the government simply to send taxpayer dollars to this group that has been caught, I believe, breaking the law, but also offending our values and our ethics.
0.0	0.527293879089	We even had warnings about the Boston Marathon bombers, and yet the dots weren't connected.
0.0	0.343888945588	We will do very, very well, very, very well.
0.0	0.661477547139	I also think the war on drugs has disproportionately affected our African-American community, and what we need to do is make sure that the war on drugs is equal protection under the law and that we don't unfairly incarcerate another generation of young African-American males.
0.0	0.615211395295	What Reagan did is he began with tax reform and regulatory reform, unleashing the engine of the American free enterprise system.
0.0	0.573114246103	And everything is costing more money, and we are killing our -- our -- our people like this.
0.0	0.512201840116	You can't get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year.
0.0	0.4214896161	It was LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations in this country.
0.0	0.253538614062	You can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.563021611702	Well, first of all, I know that the President has appealed the decision to the Supreme Court.
1.0	0.301302620819	Even our nuclear arsenal doesn't work.
0.0	0.346984177529	It's perfectly legal in this country to change your mind.
0.0	0.562523116687	Well, first of all, this is an issue that's been debated now for 30 years.
1.0	0.700540612017	And then we decided we could bring $14 billion of our money -- I mean, Washington doesn't have any money.
0.0	0.654782311486	And I also voted and helped lead the effort against the war in Iraq, which will go down in history as one of the worst foreign blunders -- foreign policy blunders in the history of our country.
0.0	0.290521708993	Does he stand up for law enforcement?
0.0	0.271210856543	Our vets are being treated horribly.
0.0	0.66477732745	I would like the federal government to offer $10 billion over ten years to work with states, and I really applaud Governor Hassan for taking up this challenge and working with the legislature here to come up with a plan.
0.0	0.266478479121	You get a lot of them that are overrated.
0.0	0.459441584273	First what they saw in Paris, now what they have seen in San Bernardino.
0.0	0.661285540662	And hopefully -- you know, Senator Graham, I -- I know where he's going to be on this, but we use Congress, and we use Congress to cut this funding.
0.0	0.288381735536	The guns don't pull the trigger.
0.0	0.65618776898	Imagine how hard it is for these people out there that are making 40, 50, $60,000 a year, and they're trying to provide for their families at a time when this economy is not growing.
0.0	0.68138735694	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.252964150378	And he is a proud American Muslim.
1.0	0.686049142302	You used to say that you were in favor of birthright citizenship, now you say that you are against it.
0.0	0.686235578016	That would fix the problem, and also allow, for those 11 million people who are here illegally, a legal status, with citizenship off the table.
0.0	0.629798756461	But Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term, and you should be showing up to work.
0.0	0.406474831131	Such a nasty -- such a nasty question, but thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.442664923637	So, just to sum up, I would do various things very quickly.
0.0	0.676855036193	I think it's a big thing that our party needs to be part of, and I've been a leader in Congress on trying to bring about criminal justice reform.
0.0	0.321331822126	You should not have to borrow a dime to pay tuition.
0.0	0.594185978846	There was nobody to talk to and it really did give me an insight into the very difficult problems presidents face.
0.0	0.417168638612	It's all about getting people to listen to one another's problems.
1.0	0.473522595284	Secondly, I never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.357095787203	Those jobs, in many cases, are now gone.
0.0	0.674791247349	But you haven't asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought I'd get that off my chest if you don't mind.
0.0	0.567913566582	We're going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education.
0.0	0.350359880617	Well, this goes to the question you were just asking.
0.0	0.655045074751	But I think -- and I say this with due respect -- that I worry too much that Secretary Clinton is too much into regime change and a little bit too aggressive without knowing what the unintended consequences might be.
0.0	0.680428152524	When you have six financial institutions in this country that issue two-thirds of the credit cards and one-third of the mortgages, when three out of four of them are larger today than when we bailed them out because they are too big to fail, we've got to re- establish Glass-Steagall, we have got to break the large financial institutions up.
0.0	0.279512042212	You just want to...
0.0	0.65742032807	... and I've had more two a.m. phone calls than everybody here put together, making life and death decisions, put together very complex teams to accomplish things that have never been done before.
0.0	0.329332960961	When we do business with China, they tax us.
0.0	0.276628837908	I will tell you that.
0.0	0.630339971891	I think we're on the verge of the greatest time, and I want to fix the things to let people rise up.
0.0	0.56431321644	I have made very clear that hardworking, middle-class families need a raise, not a tax increase.
0.0	0.317831822843	Number two, we had a really good plan.
1.0	0.562234421505	They would repeal the Affordable Care Act, not improve it.
0.0	0.323247243861	They go back and forth between Syria and this region.
0.0	0.505304101148	I know some people like to say, "well, this is free money."
0.0	0.575664935279	But, more importantly, to train a Sunni-led force in Syria to take out ISIS with our support...
0.0	0.679668940699	You think about the regulatory cost and the tax cost -- that's why small businesses are closing, rather than being formed in our country right now.
1.0	0.624663455986	Later that year, in 2004, John Kerry ran for president missing close to 60 to 70 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.654605178053	I've also called for the end of family detention, for the end of privately-run detention centers, along with private prisons, which I think are really against the common good and the rule of law.
0.0	0.269007514285	But we have a serious problem.
0.0	0.288766176077	End -- end Common Core.
0.0	0.416740812924	Roads, bridges, water systems, wastewater plants, who denies that?
0.0	0.655676170909	Then you have to get rid of Larry Kudlow, who sits on your panel, who's a great guy, who came out the other day and said, I love Trump's tax plan.
0.0	0.658738067571	And anyone who lies to the families of Americans who have died in the service of this country can never be commander-in-chief of the United States.
0.0	0.429104318327	Well, Gwen and Judy, thank you very much for hosting this event.
0.0	0.295103969314	You can go to opensecrets.org and check that.
0.0	0.27289936661	They don't know what they're doing."
0.0	0.679480026068	Both Democrats and Republicans have gotten us in the mess we're in -- $18 trillion of debt, a bad deal with Iran, we're not staying with Israel.
0.0	0.24505306702	I'm happy to have him tonight...
0.0	0.556389672606	And I think that's a mistake, and I just don't think Marco can have it both ways.
0.0	0.661160194024	But I will certainly turn to him as prior presidents have for special missions, for advice, and in particular, how we're going to get the economy working again for everybody, which he knows a little bit about.
0.0	0.261588465669	That's not right.
0.0	0.296883428573	Leading by fixing the things that are broken.
0.0	0.401782610176	And until that happens there's not going to be consensus on this issue.
0.0	0.642930497785	I've heard a lot about me in this debate, and I'm going to keep talking and thinking about all of you because ultimately, I think the president's job is to do everything possible, everything that she can do to lift up the people of this country.
0.0	0.678482551889	Twenty-four months ago, 36 months ago, you did not have a group of radical crazies named ISIS who were burning people in cages and recruiting people to enter our country legally.
0.0	0.555860170221	Many, many kids came into her home and received the kind of love that they desperately needed.
0.0	0.525248440503	If you had the court reverse Roe v. Wade, it would become a state issue once again.
0.0	0.277217205054	The Emanuel AME church killings.
0.0	0.469027779131	Everybody ought to have a chance to be able to rise to their God-given purpose.
0.0	0.210634022575	That is not what America should be about.
0.0	0.342049210517	We have three children, eight, five and one.
0.0	0.284726066219	Let me respond...
0.0	0.634968297778	And just like Social Security and unlike the Republicans, I think we should actually expand Social Security and increase average monthly benefits.
0.0	0.311738839005	Nine months ago, our campaign began.
0.0	0.322278470771	I waited and I got the scars to show for it.
0.0	0.292185542228	I would not want to go to that point.
0.0	0.659213780455	That beautiful young woman who's an entrepreneur who served in the military, first of all, is deserving of our respect for service in the military and the fact that she's an entrepreneur.
0.0	0.296940816974	You cannot grant amnesty.
0.0	0.5	To get the information from Hillary Clinton, you need to get a subpoena from the FBI.
0.0	0.434135226054	First of all, Nikki this afternoon said I'm a friend of hers.
0.0	0.259372005453	And you know what?
0.0	0.399755764939	And I believe that Puerto Rico ought to have the right of self-determination.
0.0	0.308069307682	And women have been disadvantaged ever since.
0.0	0.26475859699	We can do that.
0.0	0.29163543438	Bill, I defeated Mario Cuomo.
0.0	0.577084346966	First thing I'd tell the American people, whatever it takes to defend our nation, I would do.
0.0	0.421939699208	We cannot elect somebody that doesn't know how to do the job.
0.0	0.296567012987	They went to the DNC quietly.
0.0	0.661399360549	ISIS is a group that wants to trigger an apocalyptic showdown in the city of Dabiq -- not the city of Dubuque; I mis-said -- mis-said that wrong once (inaudible) time -- the city of Dabiq in Syria.
0.0	0.66913424424	I laid out a plan at the Citadel to do just that and it starts with creating a "No Fly Zone" and "Safe Zones" to make sure refugees are there.
0.0	0.280679558962	She never lived to see that.
0.0	0.653918264409	What we have to do is put all of our resources through the Department of Homeland Security, through the State Department, through our intelligence agencies, and we have to have an increased vetting and screening.
1.0	0.506947615376	First of all, I didn't support Sonia Sotomayor.
0.0	0.663469314592	And in our party, unlike the Republican party, we actually believe that the more our people learn, the more they will earn and higher education should be a right for every kid.
0.0	0.291630283959	It is ISIS.
0.0	0.314367890976	So let's start -- let's start with immigration.
0.0	0.662621550397	I can't speak for the Koch Brothers, you're referring to a Super PAC that we don't coordinate with, that was set up to support President Obama, that has now decided that they want to support me.
0.0	0.442779508644	And I would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country.
0.0	0.456294777206	I believe if the amendments I introduced were adopted, that the bill would pass.
0.0	0.252635234677	Yeah, they are unhinged.
0.0	0.508139829476	I will deliver for the American people if I have the privilege of leading this country.
0.0	0.5	You blindfold the American people so that they cannot see the true cost of government.
0.0	0.313914838592	I'll tell you what else people are concerned about.
0.0	0.262736394118	You once had a pension.
0.0	0.435865089598	That is the way to deal with China at the end of the day.
0.0	0.29897481285	Got to go to Haiti last year.
0.0	0.580613878847	That is what is going to have to happen, if we want to revitalize and rebuild the crumbling middle class.
0.0	0.505309275261	If these are the kinds of people -- we should use our best and our finest.
0.0	0.652960661347	I've tried to be as specific to answer questions so that my proposals can be vetted, because I feel like we have to level with people for the very reason, Gwen, that you are mentioning.
0.0	0.284493674947	And the fact is that that's not a democracy.
0.0	0.431725691155	We should be relying upon the leadership of the Congress to pass the laws.
0.0	0.287196970604	That is not protected free speech.
0.0	0.605019779077	But with all our problems with Russia, with all our problems with everything -- everything, they got away with it again.
0.0	0.655141045988	...The other thing I'd like to make about our plan, one more point, it is the most pro growth tax plan that I can imagine because it doesn't tax investments at all.
0.0	0.464290972731	She actually ran against one of my friends and our head of public safety.
0.0	0.635662861044	Make our police officers proud of what they do but more important than that, let them know how proud we are of them."
0.0	0.259842558272	It is not a barbed wire fence.
0.0	0.333022383621	...
0.0	0.666206068181	You think about it -- this is the president who said, along with his secretary of state -- drew a red line in Syria, said, if Assad uses chemical weapons against his people, that we're going to attack.
0.0	0.6603839163	We need to solve problems, we need to rebuild our military so we can stand up to radical Islam, we need to get our economy growing much faster by throwing out the corrupt tax code and lowering the rates.
0.0	0.657792866697	Judy, if I can, there is no question, Secretary Clinton and I are friends, and I have a lot of respect for her, that she has enormous experience in foreign affairs.
0.0	0.663948911498	One of them being that if you don't have some agreement within the system from states and from families and from students, it's hard to get to where we need to go.
0.0	0.242149727169	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.660216315668	I'm running hard and I believe I'll be the Republican nominee and I'll be the one best suited to beat Hillary Clinton, who should not be president of the United States.
0.0	0.273560472768	That's my bill.
0.0	0.49133635103	He said, "Yeah, they do it all the time with other people."
0.0	0.477287488677	Number one, we should allow people to purchase health insurance across state lines.
0.0	0.627061596347	If people are promising they're going to take on Washington and cronyism, you need to look to who has been doing it.
0.0	0.257886980376	And guess what?
0.0	0.669378471414	I wanna tell you, in my state, we took Medicaid, the hardest program to control, and we took it from a 10 percent growth rate to 2.5 percent without taking one person off the rolls or cutting one single benefit.
0.0	0.270286735398	And, we said no.

0.0	0.588501945732	He's missing the whole point, that America's leadership in the world is required for peace and stability.
0.0	0.566660811732	Look, I have said I want to be the president for the struggling, the striving and the successful.
0.0	0.66609967584	When you have three out of the four largest financial institutions in this country bigger today than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have six financial institutions having assets equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of America, while issuing two-thirds of the credit cards and a third of the mortgages, look, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, that great trust-buster would have said break them up.

0.0	0.665744949199	You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president...
0.0	0.591829174113	I think we have a disagreement, and the disagreement is that not only did I vote against the war in Iraq.

0.0	0.379081223231	I think it's -- yeah, I think it's a one-two punch.
0.0	0.377362922345	But I would want to agree with something that Senator Sanders says.
0.0	0.688094703332	So, yes, I do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white Americans -- particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have -- you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is.

0.0	0.359775224532	Now, who are the people who are hurt by that?
0.0	0.262543531533	I'm going to be independent.

1.0	0.469971305835	This small country has welcomed in many refugees.
0.0	0.666679409762	But the truth of the matter is, if we want wages to go up, we've got to get 11 million of our neighbors out of off the book shadow economy, and into the full light of an American economy.
0.0	0.651185740456	And I give you my word, if I am elected president, no service man or service woman will be forced to be on their knees, and any nation that captures our fighting men will feel the full force and fury of the United States of America.

0.0	0.275078379545	We had Hezbollah.
0.0	0.272037314031	Progressives don't believe that.
0.0	0.265831744106	Well, you're talking about -- yeah.
0.0	0.486741603541	You will also have to means-test the benefits and declare there's not enough money.
0.0	0.624727401661	Those costs are then added to the overall cost, which does increase the insurance premiums for people in the private system.
0.0	0.269873829991	The problem is...
0.0	0.654123959752	And I want us to be absolutely clear about making sure the insurance companies in the private employer policy arena as well as in the Affordable Care exchanges are properly regulated so that we are not being gamed.
0.0	0.652532960013	Paul Volcker, one of the leading lights of trying to reign in the excesses, has also said he does not support reinstating Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.606456405409	Now what we have to take on is the pharmaceutical industry that is ripping off the American people every single day.
0.0	0.29972102817	So we need new leadership -- yes.
0.0	0.650665006297	In a previous Democratic debate, Martha Raddatz, three times, asked Hillary Clinton about the failure in Libya, a policy that she took credit for, and said, "what is your measure of responsibility, Madam Secretary, for the failure in Libya?"

0.0	0.683052580009	What would motivate me and what would be the guiding light for me in terms of immigration reform, Judy, is to bring families together, not divide them up.
0.0	0.280870344054	I mean, Chris will know about that.

0.0	0.282393027203	Let me just -- let me respond.
0.0	0.280103249714	They don't even have a chance.
0.0	0.274462554777	And I think has had a big impact.

0.0	0.679436319477	And frankly, it just came out, and in Iowa now, as you know, Ted, in the last three polls, I'm beating you.
0.0	0.665318862691	Maria, you look at what this president and his secretary of state, Secretary of State Clinton, has done to get us in this spot.
0.0	0.688311051596	And we got to fight like crazy so people can think the American dream still exists, because it does, with rising wages, with full employment and with everybody in America -- and I mean everybody in America -- having an opportunity to realize the American dream of having a better life than their mother and their father.
1.0	0.5	What those facts knew was that these folks had weapons.
0.0	0.594682478714	And we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid.
0.0	0.330443790886	This is about the bigger, broader war against ISIS.

0.0	0.674231027116	They're not supporting our law enforcement officers, it's making everybody nervous to get out of their cars, if you're a law enforcement officer.
0.0	0.506587602068	And so, when we look at these complex problems, I wish it could be either/or.
0.0	0.289138974646	But they're killing us economically.
0.0	0.371076541209	It's one of the key investments we need to make.

1.0	0.606364780778	They don't want to pay 35 percent tax on the way back.
0.0	0.453825895103	You don't have to guess about it, because I actually have a record.
0.0	0.579188340831	Well, this is one of the reasons why Tom Perkins and I had disagreements in the boardroom, Becky.
0.0	0.286878566018	What part is valid?
0.0	0.319634117448	... it's harder and harder to actually solve this problem.
0.0	0.64768955865	We should be developing oil, and gas, and coal, and nuclear, and wind, and solar, and ethanol, and biofuels.
0.0	0.636774236145	Thirdly, what I have a really problem, and as you mentioned - this is a problem, I recognize it as a problem.
0.0	0.670472287094	ISIS came in, and now occupies significant territory in Libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold.
0.0	0.561871854811	We need a unifier, not a cynical divider in chief, and that's exactly what I will do.
0.0	0.531583212829	As you know, he came to Vermont to campaign for me when he was a senator.
0.0	0.510820576207	Well, let me -- let me first of all talk a little bit about my experience.
0.0	0.66370348842	You look at California, you look, frankly, at Paris where there's a -- the strictest no-gun policy of any city anywhere in the world, and you see what happens: 130 people dead with many to follow.
0.0	0.459630204434	I did a lot of great deals, and I did them early and young.
0.0	0.31548167123	And we need to do that throughout the country.
0.0	0.540397343002	See when you're a senator, what you get to do is just talk and talk and talk.
0.0	0.583665346126	And when the president of the United States gets out to speak about it, does he support police officers?
0.0	0.646264553852	It means that we take marijuana out of the federal law as a crime and give states the freedom to go forward with legalizing marijuana.
0.0	0.306068509894	I think we're at war with jihadists who have --
0.0	0.440505197582	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.581544913376	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.612712651333	Well, John, I think that we have to look at ISIS as the leading threat of an international terror network.
0.0	0.597924348335	Be careful of a bubble because what you've seen in the past might be small potatoes compared to what happens.
0.0	0.608203923072	My mom who's here today, was a single mom when my father left us when I was 3 years old.
1.0	0.696220200554	Ted Cruz, you used to say you supported doubling the number of green cards, now you say that you're against it.
0.0	0.288819895831	They should be Muslim troops.
0.0	0.283749776471	It was a terrible sight.
1.0	0.680635252701	Someone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander in chief and someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi can never be president of the United States.
0.0	0.281767133154	We have a role to play in this world.
0.0	0.678309749005	If elected president, I will do everything I can to expand Social Security benefits, not just for seniors, but for disabled veterans, as well.
0.0	0.26145398206	I know how hard that is.
0.0	0.666871706722	I do not want to walk my five grandkids through the charred remains of a once great country called America, and say, "Here you go, $20 trillion dollars of debt.
0.0	0.676315696246	I wish we could say yes, let's go destroy ISIS and let's let Assad continue to destroy Syria, which creates more terrorists, more extremists by the minute.
0.0	0.513120777039	We're going to be actually out there trying to create a better life for hard-working Americans.
0.0	0.249561959693	HEMMER: Wow.
0.0	0.681103006813	But I would probably have my children run it with my executives and I wouldn't ever be involved because I wouldn't care about anything but our country, anything.
0.0	0.338532152901	For 30 years this country has been baited with that.
1.0	0.711958828805	I have long supported the proposition that we should lift the cap on taxable income coming into the Social Security Trust Fund, starting at $250,000.
0.0	0.30548869848	The DNC has hired vendors.
0.0	0.622953146317	It is not a radical idea to say that a single mom should be earning enough money to take care of her kids.
0.0	0.667326343658	I have proposed there be a Middle East NATO so that we can combine our allies there to stand up to Iranian expansion, and at the same time join together to begin to stop and this ISIL thing before it becomes an actual state.
0.0	0.266400089786	They were wrong.
0.0	0.279070679816	Say again?
0.0	0.308626531685	Yes, of course Assad is a terrible dictator.
0.0	0.535402527993	Let's create an America that works for all of us, not the handful on top.
0.0	0.465794645316	And we're going to just fix everything with waste, fraud, and abuse?
0.0	0.279500115413	I love this country.
0.0	0.680458906645	Now, I find it rather amazing, because I happen to believe that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country.
0.0	0.365084104838	I've spent a lifetime in politics fighting the Clinton machine.
0.0	0.398905921073	You're not going to even allow them to come to our country?
0.0	0.433984096443	And so -- and I've always made that clear about that cover story.
0.0	0.57987055859	We call that the American Dream, although, it's built on the universal dream of a better life.
0.0	0.402856549364	And I'm not blaming these folks -- well, I guess I could.
0.0	0.620583636656	Otherwise, law enforcement is blind -- blind before, blind during, and, unfortunately, in many instances, blind after.
0.0	0.60686346551	I may not be your dream candidate just yet, but I can assure you I am Hillary Clinton's worst nightmare.
0.0	0.602957138806	You know, I've never really brought this up unless asked the question, but I have responded to the question.
0.0	0.274135144841	We've got nothing.
0.0	0.321314757952	We also have to build a coalition at home.
0.0	0.519887819592	And multiple reputable journals, including The Wall Street Journal, said ours is the best.
0.0	0.357224545337	We will see what the American people are willing to support.
0.0	0.629132151873	The first speech I gave in this campaign back in April was about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration.

0.0	0.268716576636	Barack Obama wants to change America.
0.0	0.644522408135	But I'm not deciding that anybody's got to make these decisions the way that I do, on the basis of what I do.
0.0	0.273077741791	We need to define the enemy.
0.0	0.253334847158	You're right about that.

0.0	0.276868677899	What he wants is something to get done.
0.0	0.683984812213	And that would I think give the American public a bit more of a sense of security about who is being processed and who might end up coming as refugees.
0.0	0.669403632662	I far prefer that and the chances we have to be successful there than trying to start all over again, gridlocking our system, and trying to get from zero to 100 percent.
0.0	0.5	I don't think taxpayers should be paying to send Donald Trump's kids to college.

0.0	0.280476094927	Let me respond to...
0.0	0.267641128706	It is enormously complicated.
0.0	0.443819908992	It was designed with Iowa's own Congressman Steve King and Jeff Sessions, and...
0.0	0.543258720556	We should have a path to legal status for the 12 million people that are here illegally.
0.0	0.528900312281	No, they don't like he beats the rest of the field, because they want me.

0.0	0.677073855932	We both agree that we have to get unaccountable money out of our political system and that we have to do much more to ensure that Wall Street never wrecks main street again.
0.0	0.261034770728	Because it wouldn't work.
0.0	0.677525075593	And Dulce Candy -- a pretty cool name, actually -- that is now an entrepreneur over Youtube is part of that American spirit, and we should celebrate it as conservatives.
0.0	0.296395067128	This country is changing.
0.0	0.290056253701	And we need to very, very concerned about that.

0.0	0.286645873794	Secretary Clinton is right.

0.0	0.660425233756	But the real number, the real number is anywhere from 18 to 19 and maybe even 21 percent, and nobody talks about it, because it's a statistic that's full of nonsense.

0.0	0.666276796489	I saw you on the Senate floor flip your vote on crop insurance because they told you it would help you in Iowa, and last week, we all saw you flip your vote on ethanol in Iowa for the same reason.

0.0	0.268476714685	It feels different.
0.0	0.667213146082	Well, there's no question that ISIS is a very serious problem, and I don't believe that this administration recognizes how serious it is.
0.0	0.299178898362	Can I share this quick story?
0.0	0.24443629529	We have losers.
0.0	0.268786034022	I hope the Supreme Court upholds them.
0.0	0.668018770608	In my administration, we will help to make sure we bring people together in the Middle East, and we will fight ISIS and defeat them.
0.0	0.280444886947	We have to get the remaining 10.
0.0	0.631381087154	But the issue for us is to have a Congress that stands up and says not only no, but "Hell no" to this money going to a regime that is going to use it for terror, Susan Rice has said that, and we need to stand up and strongly and clearly tell the ayatollah that -- whoever the next president of the United States is going to be, and I'll promise you, if it's me, the first thing that I will do is tear up that agreement with Iran.
0.0	0.287148696266	Professional politician that can't be trusted.
0.0	0.677642210858	And in the Holy Land Foundation trial in 2006 in Texas, they had a memorandum, an explanatory memorandum that talked about the fact that Americans would be easy to overcome and to commit civilization jihad because they were going to be trying to protect the rights of the very people who were trying to subvert them.
1.0	0.622672463504	But just think about this-- since we last debated in Las Vegas, nearly 3,000 people have been killed by guns.
0.0	0.284866635207	You can't deal in China without tariffs.
0.0	0.291924315654	Everybody thought the deal was dead.
0.0	0.287174980432	Those hedge funds.
0.0	0.335904865238	That comes out to $12,500 for each one.
0.0	0.276921154815	And he was a managing general partner.
0.0	0.27925817404	Marco can change his mind.
0.0	0.292973233316	I gotta build those big buildings.
0.0	0.454883110875	I want to ask you: Are you fed up with how Washington taxes you?
0.0	0.471176942123	Every single year close to a million people emigrate to the United States legally.
1.0	0.649234806197	Women should not be making 79 cents on the dollar compared to that.
0.0	0.404595819001	The Kurds have been asking us to arm them for three years.
0.0	0.305885248477	I mean, just think about a scenario like that.
0.0	0.356162551302	We end up paying the highest prices in the world.
0.0	0.609739493008	We created 2,000 new jobs in the solar industry and we fought every single day to adopt more inclusive economic practices.
0.0	0.476673929213	And I will go back and say again, AIG was not a big bank.
0.0	0.666543052886	Let me say first that it is disturbing that every time one of these home-grown terrorist attacks occurs, and, as your question points out, they are occurring with far too great frequency, it turns out we had warning signals.
0.0	0.680685888257	And what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice.
0.0	0.319789962916	I don't get any money from Wall Street.
0.0	0.425114501723	The insurance companies, the drug companies are bribing the United States Congress.
0.0	0.337255305919	And we have people that are controlled by special interests.
0.0	0.291392805289	They would never be hired again.
0.0	0.682168142162	The isolationist is the one who wants to continue to follow a foreign policy that has fewer democracies today than when Barack Obama came into office around the world.
0.0	0.238871216963	Thank you.
0.0	0.483839923195	I have debt-free tuition plans, free community college plans, getting student debt down.
0.0	0.606091607803	If you do that, you don't just change the economy, you transform the lives of millions of hurting Americans.
0.0	0.617401800438	And I will say this, this is going to be an election, in my opinion, that's based on competence.
0.0	0.288479151219	I will break up these banks.
0.0	0.273351324223	So there's a lot of balanced interests.
0.0	0.26475859699	You can have him.
0.0	0.551279190902	I learned so much just sitting at his feet playing with blocks listening to him negotiate with subcontractors.
1.0	0.412460916045	They were wrong.
0.0	0.482775352171	But those kinds of personal assessments and charges are ones that I find particularly troubling.
0.0	0.330175109163	People have invested a lot of energy into that.
1.0	0.679950865117	And if you tax cuts -- if you cut taxes for corporations, and you cut taxes for individuals, you're going to make things move, particularly the corporate tax, which is the highest, of course, in the -- in the world.
0.0	0.683354801053	If you look at history, John, you will find that regime change -- whether it was in the early '50s in Iran, whether it was toppling Salvador Allende in Chile, whether it is overthrowing the government of Guatemala way back when -- these invasions, these toppling of governments, regime changes have unintended consequences.
0.0	0.227484715165	So was I, John.
0.0	0.588218923677	I think that was one of the worst foreign policy blunders in the more than history of the United States.
0.0	0.605524111381	We just, earlier this week, kicked them out of Medicaid in Louisiana as well, canceled their provider contract.
0.0	0.33718370227	Our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.252753725836	You're not interested in an answer.
0.0	0.277095117169	Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, they're no better.
0.0	0.271968514255	It can happen.
0.0	0.256466569462	That's what we need.
0.0	0.651366849105	And that's why they have it in Europe, because it is a way to blindfolded the people, that's what Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.28449887276	They've become rich.
0.0	0.311095791107	I am not a member of the political class.
0.0	0.26048105618	Think about that.
0.0	0.672719991337	I think that what Libya then did by having a full free election, which elected moderates, was an indication of their crying need and desire to get on the right path.
0.0	0.277619651212	That's what I've always stood for.
0.0	0.671953657551	I -- you know, know that Senator Sanders had a different vote than I did when it came to giving immunity to gun makers and sellers.
0.0	0.255785354582	(APPLAUSE)
0.0	0.26009402097	We know about the French.
0.0	0.675409104331	And this is one of the myths that the left perpetrates on our society, and this is how they frighten people and get people to shut up.
0.0	0.460821551786	There have been more than 4,000 changes to the tax plan since 2001 alone.
0.0	0.307616433758	Judy, one area very briefly...
0.0	0.597886275297	And listen, there are many, many wonderful, wonderful working men and women in the state of New York.
0.0	0.282142473991	They can't lead us.
0.0	0.300303617249	We need sound money.
0.0	0.660163279496	If i were the president of the United States, I would go and look at every executive order that exists right now and determine which ones want to be voided, because the president shouldn't be legislating: not through that vehicle or any other.
0.0	0.27460367712	This election is not only about electing a president.
0.0	0.683359718274	I think it is fair to say, whatever the complaints that you want to make about him are, that with respect to China, one of the most challenging relationships we have, his opening up China and his ongoing relationships with the leaders of China is an incredibly useful relationship for the United States of America.
0.0	0.261254909025	But we don't know.
0.0	0.216436672863	It's not my PAC.
0.0	0.663814272607	Now the Libyans are turning their attention to try to dislodge ISIS from its foothold and begin to try to move together to have a unified nation.
0.0	0.28930950481	Madam Secretary, that is a low blow.
0.0	0.365536824573	I can tell you, there wouldn't have been much damage.
0.0	0.425235647184	You know, Chris, here's what happened with Medicaid in my state.
0.0	0.29257005582	Absolutely, we need to defund Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.284648028487	Well, this whole issue concerns me.
0.0	0.291969883803	My budget was mentioned.
0.0	0.303581392047	I said, "They send it back?"
0.0	0.676796263183	I think we ought to give Ukraine offensive weapons and I think we ought to fight them on the economic basis because Putin is a one- horse country: oil and energy.
0.0	0.270098834636	The worker's out of a job.
0.0	0.56781275275	We have got to make sure that local police departments look like the communities they serve in their diversity.
0.0	0.486936119745	But before you do that, you've got to think about what happens the day after.
1.0	0.443073670673	The bad news is, we have 470,000 going out of business every year.
0.0	0.655173671794	I want to get ahead of those, and that's why I've proposed a much more comprehensive approach to deal with all of these...
0.0	0.56028414765	And that is what's so critical for our neighborhoods, our families, our children, and our grandchildren.
0.0	0.292998571129	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.578152667842	So this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle.
0.0	0.585500420256	And I -- I supported him because I think people, when you're elected, you need to do things.
0.0	0.688141458285	After I'm called by 30 friends of mine who contributed to different campaigns, after I'm called by all of the special interests and by the -- the donors and by the lobbyists -- and they have zero chance at convincing me, zero -- I'll get a call the next day from the head of Ford.
0.0	0.671024534244	Every progressive economist who has analyzed that says that the numbers don't add up, and that's a promise that cannot be kept, and it's really important now that we are getting into the rest of the country that both of us are held to account for explaining what we are proposing because, especially with healthcare, this is not about math.
0.0	0.281763259821	You opposed him then.
0.0	0.684742820253	In the first day in office, my first executive order, I revoked every one of the executive orders that he had -- he had enacted over the prior 12 years.
0.0	0.615892785271	It's not for them to make those decisions about whether or not something is legal or illegal, or profiling or not.
0.0	0.343959456662	They're devaluing their currency and they're killing our companies.
0.0	0.576079747253	Why should we let their people be sitting there smoking their cigars, sitting in their comfortable chairs in Raqqa?
0.0	0.287899616146	...Rand is exactly right.
0.0	0.514036142799	Everybody is under fire and under attack, and we have to stand together as an alliance.
0.0	0.663789872242	So what we're going to have to start doing instead of, you know, picking on this group or this group, is we're going to have to have a major reduction in the regulatory influence that is going on.
0.0	0.598849070368	Some do, but many Americans are dying to have an opportunity to grow and to create something inside this economy.
0.0	0.335875065109	But...
0.0	0.577787946849	There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies.
0.0	0.285214024265	I will not take advice from Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.287562084709	Our country doesn't win anymore.
0.0	0.47854383293	Yes, this one falls under the category of, I have actually done this.
0.0	0.260833781019	... he's really doing some bad...
0.0	0.258966625907	You really can't.
0.0	0.321457382073	And people are saying, "What's going on?
0.0	0.360398199817	ISIS has now attacked a western democracy in -- in France.
0.0	0.379211029729	But when we came to Washington, we made a different choice.
0.0	0.288037705766	I think that is the real key here.
0.0	0.279959743767	Really big league.
0.0	0.422197497643	We have more people in jail today than any other country on earth.
0.0	0.297391022586	Are you coming onboard a proposal?
0.0	0.622116480582	For over 200 years, America's light has been shining on the world and the world has never been the same again.
0.0	0.263900191367	And that's a tragedy because now...
0.0	0.683116608509	You're seeing cities like San Francisco, cities like Los Angeles doing it, and they are doing it well and workers are able to have more disposable income.
0.0	0.257965545805	He was a little teddy bear to me.
0.0	0.283664309768	You know, this is not easy work.
0.0	0.30292636324	A lot has happened in nine months.
0.0	0.406579689588	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.684065917345	But let's be clear: Russia's aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO -- correctly, I believe -- are saying, you know what, we're going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action.
0.0	0.622377524595	Well, David, I think this is one of the most important challenges facing not just our next president but our country.
0.0	0.591938295624	What I believe has got to happen is there must be an international coalition, including Russia, a well-coordinated effort.
0.0	0.443348993029	What I said was that I think that Dr. Carson's ideas are good ideas.
0.0	0.389010454949	Here's the thing that I would ask Donald Trump in all seriousness.
0.0	0.65856928767	And especially what these programs are asking us to pass that will do nothing to help the environment, but will be devastating for our economy.
0.0	0.356980182073	Number one, you have people in this country that...
0.0	0.5194996961	Hillary doesn't want to run against me, but I cannot wait to run against her.
1.0	0.710601856297	It is also the case that that Rubio-Schumer amnesty bill, one of the things it did is it expanded Barack Obama's power to let in Syrian refugees.
1.0	0.681847190985	We get a no-good traitor, and they get the five people that they wanted for years, and those people are now back on the battlefield trying to kill us.
0.0	0.291795560704	I disagree with free college for everybody.
0.0	0.647702604585	So for me, it is looking at what works and what we need to do to try to move past what happened in '08.
0.0	0.331833609708	We need to be focusing on what fixes this country.
0.0	0.653749595304	And when you have insider information, which apparently has been the case, where people use that information and use big data to try to take advantage of it, there has to be some regulation.
0.0	0.652655295933	Well, Maria, I'm glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what's going on in the world.
0.0	0.272449204772	It's real estate.
0.0	0.316624903523	We have to do this in unison with the Arab world.
0.0	0.29629826638	Let me give you one quick example.
0.0	0.280097528971	I'm just saying.
0.0	0.319693262064	You know, I completely agree with Senator Sanders.
0.0	0.65776796901	When CEO income has risen 90 percent above the average worker, when the bottom 90 percent of this country's economy has had stagnant wages for the past 40 years, somebody is taking it in the teeth.
0.0	0.659991919831	... and here's the critical point, Maria -- the business flat tax enables us to abolish the corporate income tax, the death tax, the Obamacare taxes, the payroll taxes, and they're border-adjustable, so every export pays no taxes whatsoever.
0.0	0.659059725834	So, you know, it's fine for you to say what you're going to say, but I looked very carefully at your proposal.
0.0	0.661134934582	I will find -- within our military, I will find the General Patton or I will find General MacArthur, I will find the right guy.
0.0	0.283037897111	People aren't dumb.
0.0	0.516022294214	I will find the guy that's going to take that military and make it really work.
0.0	0.490538680747	How are we gonna -- how are we gonna go back and make it great again?
0.0	0.288635909062	Sit down with people like John Mccain.
0.0	0.50941647944	We are at war with people who use their religion for purposes of power and oppression.
0.0	0.304677163316	They know we will be committed to victory.
0.0	0.294909237115	It was an investment bank.
0.0	0.683871405962	Since he has changed his mind on amnesty, on health care and on abortion, I would just ask, what are the principles by which he will govern?
0.0	0.64905604805	It means, come out from the shadows, pay a fine, earn legal status by working, by paying taxes, learning English.
0.0	0.279506857212	QUICK: Governor, thank you.
0.0	0.680175350669	This president has failed, and when I'm in the Oval Office, police officers will know that they will have the support of the president of the Untied States.
0.0	0.247952613903	No, I don't think so.
0.0	0.655797954706	And so everybody needs to discount some of the things you're going to hear in these ads, and discount the -- the back-and-forth here, because every person here is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.624943438141	And to expand on Mr. Carson's -- or Dr. Carson's question, let's face it, we have laws already.
0.0	0.582464072804	And I can do it regardless of what the makeup of Congress is because I did it in New York state.
0.0	0.284333053658	We could do a whole show on that.
0.0	0.312959284117	That's what we need to do as a nation.
0.0	0.291591744194	Have you ever disagreed with a president?
0.0	0.301496228067	This mandatory sentencing, a very bad idea.
0.0	0.284277042008	Media notwithstanding.
0.0	0.684201654419	It is Hillary, it is Biden, it is the others who insist on allowing abortion well into viable (inaudible) wrong, and that should be stopped.
0.0	0.247701511568	I'll talk to them.
0.0	0.56517068249	I've set forth very specific plans about how to get costs down, especially prescription drug costs.
0.0	0.650360130674	Now, as far as the renewable fuel standard is concerned, certain promises were made, certain government contracts were issued which extend all the way into the year 2022, and I believe that it's probably unfair to withdraw the rug because people have invested money.
0.0	0.284541996479	That will change everything.
0.0	0.662607393051	Because they know that Hillary Clinton will never be prosecuted by this justice department, and they're going to want to put a former federal prosecutor on the stage to prosecute her next September.
0.0	0.463815188665	When you ran in 2000, you said that we needed federal robust regulations.
0.0	0.281435920523	Sadly, the American dream is dead.
0.0	0.238871216963	Thank you.
0.0	0.251573606899	They get -- they steal them.
0.0	0.41633798439	And that's what we should focus on is the violence in our communities.
0.0	0.272454303777	And it isn't because I'm all that great.
0.0	0.420392894804	We will finish the 700 miles of fencing and walls our nation needs.
0.0	0.589699335899	You see, you have one side, the Democrats, and with immigration, all they care about is votes.
1.0	0.627097252799	You know, I left my medical practice and ran for office because I was concerned about an $18 trillion debt.
0.0	0.572204105931	It will lower the cost of health care for a middle-class family by thousands of dollars a year.
0.0	0.653321522041	And if we want to try to rebuild the coalition, as Governor Kasich was saying before, then what we better do is to get to the Arab countries that believe that ISIS is a threat, not only to them, but to us and to world peace, and bring them together.
0.0	0.663409869846	We're going to lose Social Security and Medicare if Republicans and Democrats do not come together and find a solution like Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.68163466829	And I'm going to tell you this, we need to use the benefit of our law enforcement people across this country, combined with our intelligence people across this country.
0.0	0.661629010396	Secondly, in our state, we went from a loss of 350,000 jobs to, now, a gain of 347,000 jobs to the positive.
0.0	0.620007739331	And every time we give Iraq equipment, the first time a bullet goes off in the air, they leave it.
0.0	0.26266161279	How has it worked?
0.0	0.672080049959	For example, talking about polls, a poll recently came out, overwhelming majority of the American people say we should strengthen the instant background check.
0.0	0.621228258685	He launched Fast and Furious, illegally selling guns to Mexican drug lords that were then used to shoot law enforcement officials.
0.0	0.285687161333	Libya is now a mess.
0.0	0.55532214839	But this election is not about our pedigree, this is an election about people that are really hurting.
0.0	0.402950219321	Carl, are we really talking about getting government involved in fantasy football?
0.0	0.534965130541	You know, I listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas.

0.0	0.239061124621	Look what they did in San Bernardino.
0.0	0.273784751063	I have more accountants than I have nurses.
0.0	0.460174233878	I congratulate Secretary of State John Kerry and the president for working on this agreement.
0.0	0.37299988806	Because I've seen so many things get accomplished in my lifetime.
0.0	0.31024761735	Right and left are spending us into oblivion.
0.0	0.425413736117	If somebody put me on their homepage, they did it without my permission.
0.0	0.652100425815	This president, this president is more interested in funding -- less interested in funding the military, than he is in funding planned -- he's more interested in funding Planned Parenthood than he is in funding the military.
0.0	0.360622723646	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.562040486494	We've got a president who cannot bring himself to say the words "radical Islamic terrorism."
0.0	0.282858227551	Let me be clear.
0.0	0.34267124818	I mean, all of us support funding Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.294406207678	My mother is on Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.44689713659	There's a reason the NRA gave me their Carter Knight Freedom Fund award...
0.0	0.614220153062	... having said that, I don't think I'm going to get a whole lot of campaign contributions from Wall Street.
0.0	0.639583646254	And we just got to make sure that every American has the tools, in K-through-12 and in vocational education, in higher education.
0.0	0.467133213016	Each one of them, you know, described their child, had a picture.
0.0	0.286340800925	I think the times are different now.
0.0	0.399969810829	Let me say, I read that editorial today with a great amusement.
0.0	0.300626164712	We need a strategy to destroy ISIS there.
0.0	0.663697516172	The president wants to do things without working with his Congress, without working with the legislature, and without getting the consent of the American people.
0.0	0.66720524671	As a member of the Health Education Committee that helped write the Affordable Care Act, much of what Secretary Clinton said about what we have done, among other things, ending the obscenity of this pre-existing situation is a step forward.
0.0	0.655631065587	I would certainly tackle the cost issues, because I think that once the foundation was laid with a system to try to get as many people as possible into it, to end insurance discrimination against people with preexisting conditions or women, for example, that, yes, we were going to have to figure out how to get more competition in the insurance market, how to get the costs of -- particularly, prescription drugs, but other out-of-pocket expenses down.
0.0	0.599021095832	We've got challenges in the South China Sea because of what China is doing in building up these military installations.

0.0	0.268245077665	OK...
0.0	0.680279948084	But it doesn't change my view that we need to empower everyone, women and men, to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make.
1.0	0.687644952057	But more importantly, in terms of this Libya resolution that you have noted before, this was a virtually unanimous consent.
0.0	0.282408127513	Let people play, who cares?
0.0	0.281510638582	Our next president...
0.0	0.626308239785	Governor Huckabee's exactly right, we need to honor the promises made to our seniors, but for younger workers -- look.
0.0	0.527394540341	He said, "there's a chill wind blowing through law enforcement in this country."
0.0	0.418006129672	We have to lead a coalition that will take back territory from ISIS.
1.0	0.555328688861	My price tag is about $100 billion a year.
0.0	0.292537273595	I opposed and oppose legalization and citizenship.
0.0	0.260833816109	So you might not.
0.0	0.335875065109	No.
0.0	0.288838228331	And so do I.
0.0	0.31830410697	And it will have effects in the private market.
0.0	0.268245077665	OK?
0.0	0.27802946798	We need to stop that.
0.0	0.294687963985	Because we need money.
0.0	0.631041592746	He views himself not simply as the leader of Iran, but as the leader of all Muslims -- all Shia Muslims on the planet.
0.0	0.531562746521	And I'll tell you, I'm not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump.
0.0	0.29986543948	The people that Washington leaves behind.
0.0	0.321298157461	They're going to take away thousands of jobs.
0.0	0.362243694405	We the Muslims should lead the effort on the ground."
0.0	0.653369340414	During the Cold War -- during the Cold War, we got into a bad habit of always looking to see who was wearing the jersey of the communists, and who was wearing the U.S. jersey.
0.0	0.391953575101	Once again, I am running a campaign differently than any other candidate.
0.0	0.367820300779	Number one, the people negotiating don't have a clue.
0.0	0.666054321843	So, yes, I do believe that when we talk about public education in America, today, in a rapidly changing world, we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities.
0.0	0.409808346076	As you know, because I know you know a lot about health care.
0.0	0.410452783578	And I had commitments to be at a town hall in New Hampshire.
0.0	0.288311899905	And I think that's the false choice...
0.0	0.272113969503	All right.
0.0	0.628176783584	You know, you look at what's going on, you see all the divisiveness and the hatred that goes on in our society.
0.0	0.438712353408	Well, this is what I would say, and the Congressman was right.
0.0	0.484007705933	How about one that I've done in New Jersey for the last six years.
0.0	0.681837839979	The FCC jumping in now and saying, "we're going to put 400 pages of regulation over the Internet," is going to create massive problems.
0.0	0.449715047548	If an American missionary has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.654758601007	Yes, I believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on Wall Street, that they are a Wall Street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession -- Great Depression.
0.0	0.656004723935	I cannot tell you how much our nation is threatened and how we need a commander in chief who understands the threats to this nation.
0.0	0.283031352952	We want to build on it and fix it.
0.0	0.332115637133	Well, let's take it one at a time.
0.0	0.653283457968	And I said, "Didn't you resent America for not letting you be with your father in those formative and very threatening years?"
0.0	0.681709396294	We need to rebuild our military, and this president has let it diminish to a point where tinpot dictators like the mullahs in Iran are taking our Navy ships.
0.0	0.665301289278	I believe we stand together to address the real issues facing this country, not allow them to divide us by race or where we come from.
0.0	0.65211530857	Today, we have a legal immigration system for permanent residency that is largely based on whether or not you have a relative living here.
0.0	0.655738505466	But here's the best way that we're going to make America much more exceptional: it is to make sure we put someone on that stage in September who will fight Hillary Clinton and make sure she never, ever gets in the White House again.
0.0	0.689771932857	I voted against it because the Southern Poverty Law Center, among other groups, said that the guest-worker programs that were embedded in this agreement were akin to slavery.
0.0	0.328649457455	See, in Ohio, we've had some controversial decisions.
0.0	0.33910362608	She did.
0.0	0.595142592614	We've got to figure out how we can do more to understand who is saying what and what they're planning.
0.0	0.30839313909	We need someone to fight for the people.
0.0	0.5	More and more military personnel are leaving becoming veterans, and the waiting list grows.
0.0	0.284290689257	We could overthrow Assad tomorrow if we wanted to.
0.0	0.579178113304	This nation has been great to me, and that's the only way I know to pay you back.
0.0	0.209921114132	So should the UK, so should France.
0.0	0.269944296889	That's the job.
0.0	0.5	I've employed -- I've employed tens of thousands of people over my lifetime.
0.0	0.247476392058	That was before he was running against me.
0.0	0.487396505976	If we do that again, we will lose again, we will deserve to lose again.
0.0	0.659737760714	There is no issue in American public policy that I have worked on more day in and day out than this painful issue of policing, of law enforcement, criminal justice and race in America.
0.0	0.294661564302	We got nuclear weapons that are obsolete.
0.0	0.277667850117	They always keep our equipment.
0.0	0.333022383621	...
0.0	0.397090605749	So, yes, I'd absolutely would go in if he attacked.
0.0	0.655717367228	The truth is it is relatively easy for a powerful nation like America to overthrow a dictator but it is very hard to predict the unintended consequences and the turmoil and the instability that follows after you overthrow that dictator.
0.0	0.622762538587	They're working as hard as they ever have, everything costs more, and they haven't had a raise in decades.
0.0	0.270398298099	I'm not fighting that.
0.0	0.632620119172	You know, we could give you another example -- the Marines, the Army, these wonderful six soldiers that were killed.
0.0	0.429398083398	Look these are the things that we did in own state through the recession.
0.0	0.657352780324	And if that means taking on Wall Street, I have a plan that is tough and comprehensive and praised by a lot of folks who say it goes further than what both Senator Sanders and Governor O'Malley are proposing.
0.0	0.661593449195	But John, let's not fall into the trap of thinking that all of our Muslim American neighbors in this country are somehow our enemies here.
0.0	0.26457724903	This is a terribly complicated issue.
1.0	0.493936420382	The truth of the matter is, net immigration from Mexico last year was zero.
0.0	0.303756173401	I will show you what they do to women.
0.0	0.249747372126	But he wasn't a cheerleader.
0.0	0.437124853248	Well, you need somebody, because politicians are all talk, no action.
0.0	0.333022383621	...
1.0	0.412460916045	That's wrong.
0.0	0.254496022021	Our symbol is the Statue of Liberty.
0.0	0.681880614508	You have to reform Social Security, and the simple way to do it is to make sure that the wealthiest don't receive the same benefits as people that are lower-income.
0.0	0.283896150572	Of course not.
0.0	0.458308304183	Barack Obama got his massive tax increase, and there was no spending cuts.
0.0	0.277676896608	Yes, exactly, exactly.
0.0	0.457275249679	It isn't "I put money in, I'm getting it back."
0.0	0.64204332667	A law has been sitting -- languishing, sadly, on Capitol Hill and has not yet been passed, and it would help.
0.0	0.272911876869	Our differences are fairly deep on this issue.
0.0	0.300303617249	We need sound money.
0.0	0.277490042272	And for good cause.
0.0	0.446834106058	We're going to have people come in, but they're coming in legally.
0.0	0.312065457139	Secretary of state for four years.
0.0	0.458810452057	We have -- wait a second, we have $19 trillion in debt.
0.0	0.31557775898	The list goes on because the differences are so stark.
0.0	0.532877523872	Well, I would suggest a fair tax system, and that's what we have proposed.
0.0	0.6609361623	My plan is to make it work, to tell Saudi Arabia that instead of going to war in Yemen, they, one of the wealthiest countries on Earth, are going to have to go to war against ISIS.
0.0	0.601622204199	And I won't be angry when we fix it, but until we fix it, I'm very, very angry.
0.0	0.27848164196	That's exactly what we saw.
0.0	0.690150324111	It is a unique nation in all of human history and on the face of the planet, because here, our founders believed that everyone has a right to fulfill their potential and that that right --they called it life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness -- comes from God and cannot be taken away by government.
0.0	0.280346867241	I would like to see it updated.
0.0	0.273076328538	Kathie, let me say this.
0.0	0.446334983652	Don't vote for me if you want to keep the gridlock in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.249977838702	And here's what's going to happen.
0.0	0.285812385488	First of all...
0.0	0.266400089786	He's wrong.
0.0	0.428626326135	This is the only time I've had a chance, let me finish.
0.0	0.34744978885	We have to do it.
0.0	0.355655335207	We're going to do a tax cut for all Americans.
0.0	0.35844228443	We need to pay attention here in Central America as well.
0.0	0.485233017702	These are often very long- term kinds of investments that have to be made.
0.0	0.364871120091	He said, "You know, I make great product."
0.0	0.309189444165	It's why you see Walgreens buying Rite Aid.
0.0	0.543886028529	These mythical Arab armies that my friends talk about that are going to protect us don't exist.
0.0	0.616945238423	Even if it was a one percent chance, and it's far greater than one percent because (inaudible).
0.0	0.493526688881	(inaudible), the great majority of Republicans and Americans believe in a hopeful future.
0.0	0.276366106596	Yes.
0.0	0.663621512362	You know, frankly, I did it in Washington, in Ohio, and I will do it again in Washington, if I'm president, to get this country moving again.
0.0	0.667350807007	John, there is not a serious economist who would disagree that the six big banks of Wall Street have taken on so much power and that all of us are still on the hook to bail them out on their bad bets.
0.0	0.436178985659	And it costs, with dynamic scoring, less than a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.285577768568	A brief response.
0.0	0.282851928993	Just ditto to that.
0.0	0.681462442159	I am convinced because I see how he works with his attorney general, not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.575548095563	We need to incent private savings and make sure that Social Security is protected for those that have it.
0.0	0.280438378215	I was governor of New York on September 11.
0.0	0.662508135494	And, then we have to go after sentencing, and that's one of the problems here in Wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn't happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level.
0.0	0.358418831275	We differ, however, on a couple of key points.
0.0	0.273225249073	Can I tell you what?
0.0	0.416205709933	I was a person who has dealt extensively with these homeland security issues.
0.0	0.673988826437	And I say, look, it's not Republicans' fault, it's not Democrats' fault, it's your grandparents' fault for having too many damn kids.
0.0	0.287703511029	So Ford will come back.
0.0	0.387166584378	Let me agree with Governor O'Malley and let me agree with Secretary Clinton.
0.0	0.664724981362	I go further in the plan that I've proposed, which has been called the toughest, most effective, comprehensive plan for reining in the other risks that the financial system could face.
0.0	0.575912600219	But also where it's affordable, solar, wind in Iowa has become very affordable and it makes sense.
0.0	0.646059434144	We have to get down to creating a country that's not going to have the kind of problems that we've had with people flying planes into the World Trade Centers, with the -- with the shootings in California, with all the problems all over the world.
0.0	0.293739477537	I've got one more question for you then.
0.0	0.333022383621	...
0.0	0.648220553109	Because the General Services, who are terrific people, by the way, and talented people, they wanted to do a great job.
0.0	0.480271795433	We own a home four blocks away from the place that I grew up in.
0.0	0.346247282225	I'm going to do what it takes to defend this nation.
0.0	0.357122216067	In fact, Washington said that democracy requires a virtuous people.
0.0	0.569861548798	And, I'm going to tell you exactly how we're going to deal with it when I am president.
0.0	0.322638318026	We warned about the 9/11 attack before the 9/11 attack occurred.
0.0	0.265937642364	(LAUGHTER) And he got nasty.
0.0	0.667928367941	But at the same time with new technologies I believe that the people creating these projects -- I mean these products also have an obligation to come together with law enforcement to figure these things out; true to our American principles and values.
0.0	0.270366885039	I feel like...
0.0	0.355363681308	And I was there when we went into the Gulf War.
0.0	0.472267760919	That is the appropriate approach in order to get the results that you are seeking.
0.0	0.471716218686	What I did in New York was bring people together, an overwhelmingly Democratic state.
0.0	0.608538707103	And the only reason we got them back is because we owed them with a stupid deal, $150 billion.
0.0	0.58570973767	I talked about Donald Trump from the standpoint of being an individual who was using his celebrity rather than his conservatism.
0.0	0.571681924269	That's the record of accomplishment that should be taken to Hillary Clinton, who has no record of accomplishment.
0.0	0.5	Our next president, and our Republican nominee can not be someone who supports those positions.
0.0	0.280557037181	I saw them come down.
0.0	0.369183250451	Fired, never hired again and probably shunned in their community.
0.0	0.291945963123	Lehman Brothers was not a big bank.
0.0	0.266802061346	And we should be a welcoming nation.
0.0	0.444110544481	We could turn off that spigot by charging them tax until they behave properly.
0.0	0.647232709141	It doesn't do anybody any good if terrorists can move toward encrypted communication that no law enforcement agency can break into before or after.
0.0	0.648495905806	You see, why are we one of the most generous people in the world -- no, the most generous people in the world?
0.0	0.253836171519	I think that is...
0.0	0.465981749109	Number one, we do have more people who have access to health care.
0.0	0.512352800458	A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to go on a congressional delegation.
0.0	0.271914427005	I've faced it.
0.0	0.32972056553	But I think they will see a very good option here.
0.0	0.278097069041	We were attacked from Afghanistan.
0.0	0.521453695411	We are not the world's policeman, but we need to stand up and be ready.
0.0	0.468687526435	We can take many of those same procedures, we can apply it to Medicare.
1.0	0.263906035108	I didn't have an involvement with them.
0.0	0.285366831474	We have a country of laws.
0.0	0.627126602663	And I've heard some great ideas about how law enforcement is changing its behavior, how the recovery community is reaching out.
0.0	0.253357928307	I don't want it.
0.0	0.420743138433	I am a conservative because I know our values, our principles and our policies --
0.0	0.387317314386	-- at least half of the things Marco said are flat-out false.
0.0	0.256732809261	But the voters are savvier than that.
0.0	0.676798397711	I've had a lot of folks give me donations from all kinds of backgrounds say, I don't agree with you on everything, but I like what you do.
0.0	0.333022383621	...
0.0	0.420615223555	But what he's touching -- talking about, I think has got merit.
0.0	0.260897162639	They're a scam.
0.0	0.39398026704	Well, look the Joint Terrorism Task Force needs resources and tools.
0.0	0.296276514964	Look, I look at our economy as an ecosystem.
0.0	0.283717676677	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.255367381021	I'm the only person...
0.0	0.47724554782	But the differences among us pale compared to what's happening on the Republican side.
0.0	0.426245201428	I applaud Secretary Kerry and the president for trying to put together this agreement.
0.0	0.356925412426	If you place bad bets, the taxpayers bail you out.

0.0	0.608109202043	We raised the military spending, took from entitlements, and raised domestic spending and the deficit will explode under this.
0.0	0.265666441956	If I am elected president...
0.0	0.657414086693	You know, when you go into the store and buy a box of laundry detergent, and the price has up -- you know, 50 cents because of regulations, a poor person notices that.
0.0	0.563629034208	You know, that's what the PC culture is all about, and it's destroying this nation.
0.0	0.368573070249	That's what I said to my own public health people.
0.0	0.675046073461	Well, let's just -- let's just follow up on this, because, you know, I've made it very clear that no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail, and because of Dodd-Frank, we now have in law a process that the president, the Federal Reserve, and others can use if any bank poses a systemic risk.
1.0	0.696661361258	As I understand it, the African-American community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse.
0.0	0.679530758646	I'm saying, absolutely, we don't have to continue to lose 505 billion dollars as a trade deficit for the privilege of dealing with China.
0.0	0.414910028433	Yes, they have to stop being the main state sponsor of terrorism.
0.0	0.306087614463	Those are two leaders that I admire very much.
0.0	0.551696126053	One, work with the tough men, the dictators, for our own benefit and promote democracy.
0.0	0.51279386727	But now, that light is dimming a little, after seven years of Barack Obama.
0.0	0.273571834169	Listen, I want to just comment.
0.0	0.488406096293	That's the truth of the matter and you see it every time with this president.
0.0	0.33230689525	I think it's important we put this in historic context.
0.0	0.249060824845	I have to tell you.
0.0	0.625462186274	When it comes to ISIS, we will not weaken them, we will not degrade them, we will utterly and completely destroy ISIS
0.0	0.533525289706	There's so much work that can be done, so much we've learned to do better.
0.0	0.653074978489	So what I will tell you about our incentives -- our incentives are tight, and at the end of the day we make sure that we gain more from the creation of jobs than what we lose.
0.0	0.260534792137	That's not true.
0.0	0.328060144744	Run the company kids, have a good time.
0.0	0.403145409767	Millions coming out of school as you indicated, deeply in debt.
1.0	0.286658902416	Believe me, that is why Ohio is doing well.
0.0	0.603892419107	We ought to send some real junk, because, frankly, it would be -- we ought to send our surplus.
0.0	0.623888462727	You know, maybe they're dumb and they don't know what they're going to get, but I don't think so.
0.0	0.6666199454	Eradicate those and you fix Medicare and you've fixed America, its economy and you've made people's lives a heck of a lot better.
0.0	0.656546662843	And I believe that not only Barney Frank, Paul Krugman, and others, have said that what I have proposed is the most effective.
0.0	0.279599390935	...we need to honor our promises...
0.0	0.386448775142	If the right person asked them, they'd pay a fortune.
0.0	0.332402137959	Well, I'll tell you who is on my side.
0.0	0.5	And I went to one of these Turkish refugee camps right on the border of Syria.
0.0	0.667301553681	Maria, I'd like to interrupt this debate on the floor of the Senate to actually answer the question you asked, which was on entitlements.
0.0	0.566728484934	But the real -- but I think we have to get back to what this election has to be about.
0.0	0.288870264981	When do we beat Mexico at the border?
0.0	0.276366106596	Yes.
0.0	0.351582013197	We're nowhere close to a balanced budget or fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.677167160367	We were one of two states to go to AAA bond rating, and our government spending was far less than the spending in people's income.
0.0	0.26048105618	Think of it.
0.0	0.671133184409	And it's probably not going to happen until we have real campaign finance reform and get rid of all these superpacs, and the power of the insurance companies and the drug companies.
0.0	0.643731506736	In my case, whether it's health care, or getting us to debt-free tuition, or moving us toward paid family leave, I have been very specific about where I would raise the money, how much it would cost, and how I would move this agenda forward.
0.0	0.368015524398	Who do you know will stop amnesty and secure the borders?
0.0	0.690675143096	There is one major country -- the United States -- which ends up spending almost three times per capita what they do in the U.K. guaranteeing health care to all people, 50 percent more than they do in France guaranteeing health care to all people, far more than our Canadian neighbors, who guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.413860093219	You know, we've got a lot of great talkers running for president.
0.0	0.394848572629	That's exactly what I'll do as president of the United States.
0.0	0.669150723157	Because for the last 24 hours, with those issues being so urgent to people as they tune in tonight, wondering how they're even be able to buy presents for their kids.
0.0	0.267521192945	The Shi'a-Sunni split.
0.0	0.293410255778	It begins with tax reform.
0.0	0.278543678403	You don't hear it from anybody else.
0.0	0.66872471107	So, I think it's absolutely wrong policy for us to be even imagining we're going end up putting tens of thousands of American troops into Syria and Iraq to fight ISIS.
0.0	0.303730395675	We are at 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.599831414658	... and I know Bernie, and I can promise you he's not going to be president of the United States.
0.0	0.604734307314	That expertise needs to spread all across the government and there needs to be much more cooperation with our private sector.
0.0	0.268940734223	You know, that's so simple.
0.0	0.322797868211	Wall Street today has too much political power.
0.0	0.468715756794	That sounds like people are afraid the president's going to take their guns away.
0.0	0.669576002589	And if you go to my Web site, berniesanders.com, what you find is not only going to help lead the opposition to that war, but much of what I feared would happen when I spoke on the floor of the House, in fact, did happen in terms of the instability that occurred.
0.0	0.274085373975	We're always losing this gorgeous brand-new stuff.
0.0	0.684067547941	As I said before, we are a land of immigrants, but we have to be intelligent about the way that we form our immigration policies, and that's one of the reasons that I have called on us to declare war on the Islamic State because we need to reorient our immigration policies and our visa policies for people who are coming into this country because there are many people out there who want to destroy us.
0.0	0.513843816575	Today a male African-American baby born today stands a one-in-four chance of ending up in jail.
0.0	0.555409155354	There's probably no person I respect more in the country or in recent history than my father.
0.0	0.250646127917	They're very concerned about it.
0.0	0.4527596413	And this is why you need to send someone from outside of Washington to Washington.
0.0	0.276943979025	Right.
0.0	0.676213431362	Everyone up here tonight that's talking about reforms, I think and I know for myself I speak to this, we're all talking about reforms for future generations.
0.0	0.548200776406	Just as morale in the military has plummeted in the last seven, so it had then.
0.0	0.428183812289	Government causes a problem, and then government steps in to solve the problem.
0.0	0.679771395667	There is no reason why you can't stand for principles, go and fight for them and be able also, to have to get things done in government.
0.0	0.515039980085	What the polls are showing is that we are actually defeating the secretary among younger people.
0.0	0.298284723386	Because you realize that people depending on you.
0.0	0.250166256413	As an outsider, I tackled H.P.
0.0	0.299415645101	I will stop Iran from getting nuclear weapons.
0.0	0.295183125367	I've prosecuted terrorists.
0.0	0.25628663074	They're not good.
0.0	0.666056616471	Americans are looking for somebody that's going to give them, and there is a place in this country over the last eight years in particular that talked about hope every day, and they didn't just talk about it, they delivered it.
0.0	0.665632963346	That's why as commander in chief, I will take on ISIS, not only because it keeps us safe, but because it allows us to absolutely conduct our religious affairs the way we find in our heart and in our souls.
0.0	0.626383758271	And I have the feeling you're going to find a lot of cost overruns there and a lot of waste and duplicative activities.
0.0	0.660113626842	So I want to explain why this is not in America's interest to react with this kind of fear and respond to this sort of bigotry.
0.0	0.29501733571	(APPLAUSE) This is not a cage match.
0.0	0.290359000463	I just wish he wouldn't misrepresent mine.
0.0	0.556628319499	I love the Chinese people but they laugh themselves, they can't believe how stupid the American leadership is.
0.0	0.264339072435	You're right.
0.0	0.398206326722	It brought booming economic growth and that growth fueled rebuilding the military.
0.0	0.276210293163	But you know what else they're anxious about?
0.0	0.565977106297	That has to be enforced absolutely with consequences for Iran at the slightest deviation from their requirements under the agreement.
0.0	0.375528400113	Three million women have fallen into poverty under this administration.
0.0	0.669856450456	I believe capital gains, for the most part, should be taxed the same way we tax income from hard work, sweat, and toil.
0.0	0.313892451424	People have been paying it for years.
0.0	0.660059772261	Maybe now we can get it moving again so that we can upgrade it so that it does include all the tools and everything in our arsenal that we can use to try to work with our allies and our friends, come up with better intelligence.
0.0	0.257886980376	And guess what?
0.0	0.253660310041	I'm proud of my family.
0.0	0.343843414496	We can create a situation where wages begin to rise.
1.0	0.268362173719	It doesn't exist, folks.
0.0	0.417772015468	If the United States does not lead, there is not another leader.
0.0	0.291035049649	I recommended that the president go forward.
0.0	0.285344489805	Nobody can solve it like me.
0.0	0.298609092671	Everybody's for amnesty except for Ted Cruz.
0.0	0.376891432744	If they had guns, he wouldn't be around very long.
0.0	0.353330648178	It's not just about getting rid of a single dictator.
0.0	0.515496038795	It's always a solution of the left to create more Government from the Federal Government.
0.0	0.305377018713	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.573478869987	I am running for president of the United States because it is too late for establishment politics and establishment economics.
0.0	0.280874953145	We will win on everything we do.
0.0	0.536657755219	... and sign an agreement that makes sure that the world knows that they will have technological superiority.
0.0	0.265716774379	They don't know what they're doing.
0.0	0.277231235205	We're not going to dismantle everything.
0.0	0.42830866438	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the free enterprise system.
0.0	0.317582820353	We can't afford another four years of that.
0.0	0.559596205998	You wrote a book where you changed your position from a path of citizenship to a path of legalization.
0.0	0.410360258777	The first thing is we have to strengthen our alliances around the world.
0.0	0.437644946895	I mean, I know Secretary Clinton was gleeful when Gadhafi was torn apart.
0.0	0.610120295038	I've got the backbone, I've got the band width, I've got the experience to get us through this.
0.0	0.400327919317	You cannot destroy ISIS with a military that's being diminished.
0.0	0.526216327085	And what I hear is people's concern that the economy we have is a rigged economy.
0.0	0.315974480418	... and 85 percent of gun owners agree.
0.0	0.295609462333	People are upset about it.
0.0	0.600516769023	It's the evil government that is -- that is putting all these regulations on us so that we can't survive.
0.0	0.295700346896	We will work with our Sunni allies.
0.0	0.264733638181	Well, I did.
0.0	0.66639379589	And when you do that, when you're in a position of managing regulations; when you reduce taxes; and when you have fiscal discipline, you see the job creators begin to get very comfortable with the fact that they can invest.
0.0	0.246774746799	This is extraordinary.
0.0	0.26826997872	The answer is yes.
1.0	0.341268174176	It allows President Obama to borrow unlimited amounts of money.
0.0	0.279342012201	Bernie Sanders, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.
0.0	0.289994171379	And the last piece is this.
0.0	0.460170866614	I think it's a wonderful that that businesses start a 401(k).
0.0	0.561210111072	We don't need to add new rules, we need to make sure the FBI does its job.
0.0	0.380239284118	That's real moral authority that we need in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.653722167753	And I believe that we can springboard off of this new U.N. resolution, and we should create, as Secretary Clinton indicated, and I agree with that, that there should be a political process.
0.0	0.680409751066	And if we capture any of them alive, they are getting a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know.
0.0	0.5	And we don't need a weak person being president of the United State, OK?
0.0	0.662416809471	Ohio, one of the best growing places in the country -- I not only did it in Washington, I did it in Ohio, and I'll go back to Washington, and there will be no more silly deals...
0.0	0.450867217843	And so I think really that vote is going to stay in the Paul household.
0.0	0.612010119077	We can create a situation for our children to be able to get a decent job to pay down their college debt.
0.0	0.579669494482	When I'm president of the United States we are getting rid of Obamacare and we are rebuilding our military.
0.0	0.573290672579	And the people who are getting hammered are small businesses, it's single moms, it's Hispanics.
0.0	0.264594375483	What a brilliant idea that would be.
0.0	0.247603121851	He was such a nice guy.

0.0	0.331565725112	They want American troops back in the Middle East.
0.0	0.3737715042	And John Kerry described it as attacks that would be unbelievably small.
0.0	0.51533218201	We're going to have a three-bracket tax code, 10, 15 and 25 percent.
0.0	0.660933404082	How can we beat an enemy if our commander-in-chief doesn't have the moral honesty and clarity to say that Islam has a problem, and that problem is radical Islam, to say they've got to condemn not generic acts of violence, but the individual murderers who are committing these acts of violence.
0.0	0.428043232874	No Jeb, I don't remember -- well, let me tell you.
0.0	0.318503247742	We're going to bring jobs and manufacturing back.
0.0	0.298703166102	Can you have Medicare or Social Security?
0.0	0.684986878698	A person who, in fact, has a long experience in foreign-policy issues, which is different from many of the other governors and prospective governors who are running.
0.0	0.331232972634	And here's the problem in this country right now.
0.0	0.685750764268	And yet the man who led my firing, Tom Perkins, an icon of Silicon Valley, has come out publicly and said, "you know what?
0.0	0.67001412772	And clearly, what we need to do is get a group of experts together, including people from other countries, some of our friends from Israel, who have had experience screening these people and come up with new guidelines for immigration, and for visas, for people who are coming into this country.
0.0	0.512328132985	Now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world.
0.0	0.440505197582	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.256629721396	All of these are very difficult issues.
0.0	0.275732928006	Let me say on that...
0.0	0.678146061877	And, let me now on Social Security because we were getting into a good substantive exchange, and I want to say I think both Chris, and Mike are right.
0.0	0.686386241977	In fact, just last week, I introduced the Life at Conception act, which would say that the 14th amendment would defend an individual even in the womb.
0.0	0.313580045773	There is a pretty excruciating process that refugees go through.
0.0	0.30356508634	This country is running out of time.
0.0	0.395295030233	There's no nation on earth that comes close to that number.
0.0	0.238871216963	Thank you.
0.0	0.318545717695	So it's unfair to say in total...
0.0	0.515983837158	We need somebody that can take the brand of the United States and make it great again.
0.0	0.346928948698	But when you're a governor, you have to admit it.
0.0	0.258935965203	We have to obey the laws.
0.0	0.284743584254	Neil, my name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.656916511448	I know that he has said in the two previous that he wants to take on this immunity issue because we need to send a strong message to the gun manufacturers, to the sellers, to the gun lobby.
0.0	0.616207313984	We were the only state in American that went four years in a row without a penny increase in college tuition.
0.0	0.291693584442	I want security.
0.0	0.431528289928	Listen, I think that what people should do is use their common sense.
0.0	0.313526472172	Well, he appointed Eric Holder as attorney general.
0.0	0.68809522507	It'll produce enormous economic growth, and it eliminates every mandate, every subsidy, so there's no subsidies for oil and gas, no subsidies for anyone.
0.0	0.382008232827	They worked hard to provide us the chance at a better life.
0.0	0.557196081333	And if we do those things, we can be a country that actually can afford debt-free college again.
0.0	0.282865876465	So under President Trump, here's what would happen:
0.0	0.37332516333	Islamic terrorism is eating up large portions of the Middle East.
0.0	0.286167161445	There's a big question mark on your head.
1.0	0.527786250775	When that war began, we had 529 ships.
0.0	0.682904882923	Now, in fact, what we have got to do -- and I think there is widespread agreement here -- is the United States cannot do it alone.
1.0	0.659888011437	But I will -- but I will tell you this, the socialist says they're going to pay for everything and give you everything for free, except they don't say they're going to raise it through taxes to 90 percent to do it.
0.0	0.249234240604	It's not only a problem here.
1.0	0.697926367154	But as you've indicated for millions of American workers, people in New Hampshire -- all over America, they're working longer hours for lower wages deeply worried about their kids.
0.0	0.34744978885	So what do we do?
0.0	0.400357033009	I also am very committed to getting the price of drugs down.
0.0	0.305293773344	We raised the minimum wage.
0.0	0.292931252472	Socialist and government dependent.
0.0	0.280024954437	It takes away discretion from judges.
0.0	0.455090907083	So, I've laid out a five-point plan about what we can do together.
0.0	0.483906826594	And second, the international crisis we are facing is most dreadful and most dangerous.
0.0	0.279053736176	Come with me to Iraq and Afghanistan, folks.
0.0	0.321753944972	It will give hope to millions of young people.
0.0	0.283511798458	Marco, Marco -- he brought up my name.
0.0	0.653539417943	Well, as you know, I'm a former elected prosecutor, a former elected attorney general, trained at the University of Virginia in constitutional law, and I don't believe in litmus tests except this.
0.0	0.60374959188	You know, she only had a third-grade education, but -- you know, she knew how to stretch a dollar.
0.0	0.262373266931	Well, I would really appreciate that.
0.0	0.381246378013	The bible commands us to let our light shine on the world.
0.0	0.453540694581	The question always is, what works better, the private marketplace or government?
0.0	0.262917557419	We got it.
0.0	0.669991396916	And so when we talk to our allies and we give them our word, in a Christie administration, they know we're going to keep it.
0.0	0.605819668861	Well, I believe, and I know that if Iowa helps make me the Republican nominee, I will defeat Hillary Clinton.

1.0	0.701038159734	They were watching the humiliation of our young ten sailors, sitting on the floor with their knees in a begging position, their hands up.
0.0	0.23240855403	With all the candidates, why me?
0.0	0.670528253283	And they say down as a group trying to make sure that we can begin to heal some of these problems that we see between community and police.
0.0	0.347902460616	How about talking about the substantive issues the people care about?
0.0	0.657157858989	They see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on Wall Street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all.
0.0	0.52495226177	I would say that on this issue, I'm a little bit more conservative than the Secretary...
0.0	0.404391667757	But the final thing I want to say about this is the following.
0.0	0.272855688824	So I want to tell you this story.
0.0	0.561465487345	Look, the conservative message is economic growth and along with economic growth goes opportunity for everybody in America.
0.0	0.408846057852	I intend to do the exact same thing to defeat radical Islamic terrorism --

0.0	0.299765915832	They do not want us to exercise religious liberty.
0.0	0.6749139095	Somebody said to me the other day, a reporter, a very nice reporter, "But, Mr. Trump, you're not a nice person."
0.0	0.287051060692	I made it the old-fashioned way.
0.0	0.347954226371	There's nobody out there looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.286804997037	The millionaires and billionaires are doing great under Obama.
0.0	0.33910362608	And why?
0.0	0.676037595692	I want to use pell grants to help defray the living expenses that often make a difference, whether a young person can stay in school or not.
0.0	0.511319877268	The Republican Party is blessed to have 11 good candidates, (inaudible) 10 good candidates.
0.0	0.680544084709	Let's take the money that we would give to Planned Parenthood and put it in women's health care without having to harvest the organs of the unborn.

0.0	0.543916008722	I'd say, "General, enforce the law against everyone justly, fairly, and aggressively.

0.0	0.446992207898	Look, every time the Federal Government gets engaged in something it gets worse.
0.0	0.529559377041	You know, I want to go back for a moment to what we were just talking about.
0.0	0.266962961707	That's right.
0.0	0.280672773885	I learned so much.
0.0	0.665256080197	The fact is -- and if for some reason he beats the rest of the field, he beats the rest of the field (inaudible).
0.0	0.278169329459	And Teddy Roosevelt is right.
0.0	0.288253321178	I will be that new leader.

0.0	0.286740687006	Just because this is not an esoteric argument.
0.0	0.491222141585	There are ways to retrain the 50 and 51-year-olds, because they've got great value.
0.0	0.344337257029	The matter is what orders exist now that shouldn't exist?
0.0	0.269432887105	Go on to my website.
0.0	0.29721873726	We must keep America safe from this threat.
1.0	0.671873301164	However, what Alan Krueger said in the piece you're referring to is that if we went to $15, there are no international comparisons.
0.0	0.307470389066	I'm one of the 77 percent.
0.0	0.527559499206	And no matter what your faith is, that's what I want you to be able to do.
0.0	0.669744426704	Last I heard, a United States senator had the right to disagree with the president, including a president who has done such an extraordinary job.
0.0	0.460453930166	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.659573556476	Or a young woman who had been performing at President Obama's second inauguration coming home, absolutely stellar young woman, hanging out with her friends in a park getting shot by a gang member.

0.0	0.673161655567	They can do business with Iran, or they can do business with America, and I am very confident they're going to choose America before they choose the Iranian economy.
0.0	0.248558439273	How great is that?
0.0	0.33928971204	And I appreciate greatly Senator Sanders' voting record.
0.0	0.303719899106	...income tax...
0.0	0.471172729315	So you know, I had to report results every 90 days in excruciating detail.
0.0	0.263952376843	I don't care.
0.0	0.4148228995	And my record was one of cutting taxes each and every year.
0.0	0.288424418177	I would just...
0.0	0.247807526886	Why weren't they vigilant?
0.0	0.281260109087	And we have to stop all the divisions.
0.0	0.316501353721	I will run on my record all day long.
0.0	0.299882051792	I would invite him, I actually would say.
0.0	0.303445259756	Nobody would be tougher on ISIS than Donald Trump.
0.0	0.580534141915	All right, Nancy, I really wish you'd come back to me on this on this one, John...
0.0	0.310774099292	We're going to end up in the same place.
0.0	0.305825688987	Just like getting rid of Medicare and Medicaid.
0.0	0.652850822667	Number two, I want Medicare to be able to negotiate for lower drug prices just like they negotiate with other countries' health systems.
0.0	0.601315289151	Big government favors the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected, and crushes the small and the powerless.
0.0	0.260593032921	Let's be frank here.
0.0	0.645171002143	So, we're talking about -- we're talking about reform for people like me and people like Senator Cruz, as he talked about earlier, who are years away from retirement that have a way to plan for these changes, and way that's very reasonable.
0.0	0.684512458116	So whoever is part of the family of a president has an extraordinary privilege of not only having a front row seat on history but making her or maybe his contribution.
1.0	0.682973361146	We have the highest rate of childhood poverty among almost any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.286249175209	In all due respect...
0.0	0.66359072448	They're taking money from Social Security and they're going to spend it on the military and they're going to spend it on domestic spending.
0.0	0.340937878983	This election has to be about reversing all of that damage.
0.0	0.355015138061	China doesn't pay the tariff, the buyer pays the tariff.
0.0	0.280476094927	Let me respond to...
0.0	0.686450796137	But we can do is defund Planned Parenthood, and by the way, put in place an absolute permanent ban on any taxpayer dollars ever being used to fund abortions.
0.0	0.391115618437	I certainly agree with FDR for all the reasons Senator Sanders said.
0.0	0.335875065109	No.
0.0	0.278230978797	And second of all...
0.0	0.653503262419	Well, we did have a plan, and I think it's fair to say that of all of the Arab leaders, Gaddafi probably had more blood on his hands of Americans than anybody else.
0.0	0.288814766292	Yes, let's tell the truth, Martin.
0.0	0.375944850556	I -- I've been for pausing on admitting the Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.270373307975	I'm really rich.
0.0	0.666141463577	Look, we are fighting for every vote that we can get from women, from men, straight, gay, African-Americans, Latinos, Asian-Americans.
0.0	0.266264587455	My plan is there.
0.0	0.602994732397	But we're becoming a third word country, because of our infrastructure, our airports, our roads, everything.
0.0	0.254669968189	I would prioritize them.
0.0	0.57701598535	Mine is unique in the sense that my tax plan actually gets rid of the payroll tax as well.
0.0	0.245200032662	I agree with them.
0.0	0.488283332128	But I had to stand up and come back and get the best that we could.
0.0	0.627651052219	Marco made the choice to go the direction of the major donors -- to support amnesty because he thought it was politically advantageous.
0.0	0.268245077665	OK?
0.0	0.305160996094	So we have a unique opportunity to bring everybody together.
0.0	0.65541682296	We'll have mandatory E-verify, a mandatory entry/exit tracking system and until all of that is in place and all of that is working and we can prove to the people of this country that illegal immigration is under control, nothing else is going to happen.
0.0	0.62630409283	We're going to cut Medicare and Medicaid, federal aid to education to help you, because the government is so terrible.
0.0	0.381704535072	See, I think there is an opportunity to bring the world together.
0.0	0.68353179235	Well, first of all, like many other very big businessmen, I could name them here, but I'm not going to do that for a lot of obvious reasons, but the biggest, and almost all of them, they've all used the chapter laws, the bankruptcy laws to their own benefit.
0.0	0.654139217075	We got to do a lot about the high cost of high -- higher education, but we've got to make sure we're training people for jobs that exist, that are good jobs that can pay.
0.0	0.677108151817	For a start, the secretary and I disagree -- and I think the president does not agree with her -- in terms of the concept of a no-fly zone in Syria.
0.0	0.468660181088	You can -- if you -- you flew in with your 767, didn't you?
0.0	0.583498140793	I believe that it's most important that we unleash the full potential of women and girls in our society.
0.0	0.654371207435	Well, look, I think that she's been saying that for as long as I've known her, which is about 25 years.
0.0	0.256883789964	You don't have to say that.
0.0	0.521891465895	Well, that has not been a part of most of the proposals that I've seen.
0.0	0.349345903074	People died, and only three people have been fired.
0.0	0.26373955112	Hillary Rodham Clinton did that to our country.
0.0	0.521153237052	You have got to pick somebody who has experience, somebody that has the know-how, the discipline.
0.0	0.301340485217	Is there an area for a safety net?
0.0	0.680878356955	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.598279189179	The majority of people in American actually have values and principles and they believe in the very things that made America great.
0.0	0.362209350197	We've got 11 million undocumented people in this country.
0.0	0.465961509886	I'm asking folks not just to join my campaign, but join a cause.
0.0	0.277038050838	It's called the politics.
0.0	0.281408421762	We got rid of Gadhafi.
0.0	0.273928894298	The fact is, the reason why...
0.0	0.374017080285	ISIS is now found in affiliates in over a dozen countries.
1.0	0.715046070838	Millions of Americans have lost their jobs, have been forced into part-time work, have lost their health insurance, have lost their doctors, have seen their premiums skyrocket.
0.0	0.35124457975	I think we need to do a lot more than we're doing.
0.0	0.336650691545	We also want to dominate this from a commercial side.
0.0	0.688730106014	And not only did I win, but I then worked with a Democratic legislature to put in place the most sweeping conservative reforms of any state in America, taking us from the most dangerous state in America to the fourth safest; reducing our welfare rolls by over 1 million, and replacing over 700,000 private sector jobs.
0.0	0.264064863309	But the facts are simple.
0.0	0.352489890191	You want to know why things don't get done in Washington?
0.0	0.658375985042	You know, I know to a lot of people in the media, this is just a great big game, and we're the players.
0.0	0.30413206695	This president allows lawlessness throughout this country.
1.0	0.290435765393	They're bringing drugs.
0.0	0.27664848443	I have a problem with that, Martha.
0.0	0.65698457335	So I have proposed debt free tuition, which I think is affordable and I would move a lot of the Pell Grant and other aid into the arena where it could be used for living expense.
0.0	0.290591762193	We never dreamt we'd ever see it."
0.0	0.276516078766	Now, you've got Europe.
0.0	0.650241354696	And the one thing is that when you run, you have to announce and certify to all sorts of governmental authorities your net worth.
0.0	0.270545391629	Thank you very much.
0.0	0.274585817266	They're laughing at us, at our stupidity.
0.0	0.263303510785	That could be the great Trojan Horse.
0.0	0.560645473165	The government is not always going to save us and it's not always going to come from government.
0.0	0.303915027186	The Democrats can't even come up with one.
0.0	0.257584291181	He's very upset.
0.0	0.624477368308	The main problem with Medicare right now is that the average person pays in taxes over their whole lifetime about $100,000.
0.0	0.342114216238	We have Dodd-Frank.
0.0	0.624703096592	Let me start -- I want to get to the substance of the question on jobs, but I want to start with something.
0.0	0.269751517574	Yes, I agree.
0.0	0.675046547801	That, I think, between the two of us demonstrates the strength of the support we have among people who want to see change in our country.
0.0	0.33532134696	So the fact is that we work for the people.
0.0	0.26475859699	We can do that.
0.0	0.625687247678	But I think to suggest that I have voiced criticism, this blurb that you talk about, you know what the blurb said?
0.0	0.660788685043	After those four years of looking back and being prepared, the preparation to be the most powerful individual in the world requires an extraordinary amount of work: not just having been the governor of the 12th largest economy in the world, which I might add, we added 1.5 million jobs during that period of time over that 2007 through 2014 period, a period when America was going through the most deep recession it had been through since the Great Depression.
0.0	0.258790095659	You find me...
0.0	0.654743630745	At the core of that resolution is an agreement I negotiated in June of 2012 in Geneva, which set forth a cease-fire and moving toward a political resolution, trying to bring the parties at stake in Syria together.
0.0	0.657663376559	I have the best courses in the world, so I'd say, you what, if he wants to -- I have one right next to the White House, right on the Potomac.
0.0	0.632014948871	I do, however, believe in Reagan's 11th commandment, and will not be engaging in awful things about my compatriots here.
0.0	0.646631045249	This is what I think -- this is what many economists believe that one of the reasons that real unemployment in this country is 10 percent, one of the reasons that African American youth unemployment and underemployment is 51 percent is the average worker in America doesn't have any disposable income.
1.0	0.387443303962	The government stole it, and spent it a long time ago...
0.0	0.560712570759	Our enemies are getting stronger and stronger by the way, and we as a country are getting weaker.
0.0	0.257052120185	Thank you, John.
0.0	0.289098646218	...is paid -- played fairly.
0.0	0.65368565427	Let me tell you, everybody, when they say they want to give it to you for free, keep your hands on your wallets because they're coming to you to pay for it.
0.0	0.615067503925	And at least if we enact these laws in a prospective way, we can address a major vulnerability in our country.
0.0	0.259640558245	Maybe you haven't.
0.0	0.22500688743	This is the fantasy...
0.0	0.573142972079	I would hope that you would come onboard and say that this is the simple and straightforward thing to do.
0.0	0.666227201343	We now have this great accomplishment known as the Affordable Care Act, and I don't think we should have to be defending it among Democrats.
1.0	0.429681541518	Very few children.
0.0	0.384807963253	I want to take off from that point and argue the same thing.
0.0	0.284616325817	There's something going on and it's bad.
0.0	0.656778362863	You know, in recent travels around this country, I've encountered so many Americans who are discouraged and angry as they watch our freedom, our security and the American dream slipping away under an unresponsive government that is populated by bureaucrats and special interest groups.
0.0	0.680168877625	I think we become unmoored and I think without the religious foundation that guides us all, I think we have a great risk of going horribly in the wrong direction.
0.0	0.57610934422	The result of that, you had the Iranian Revolution coming in, and that is where we are today.
0.0	0.287983125777	And so, you go the extra mile.
0.0	0.287199522525	We actually did it.
0.0	0.288104836535	Bill.
0.0	0.314134866027	Now hundreds of companies I've opened.
0.0	0.273564761504	I couldn't talk to anybody about it.
0.0	0.668492598486	The statistics from Wisconsin are particularly troubling, because it is the highest rate of incarceration for African-Americans in our nation, twice the national average.
0.0	0.640896166952	I met recently with some members of the Chaldean Christian communities and the wait times are a year, 18 months, 24 months.
0.0	0.689874401891	He might not take my phone call, but he would get the message, and the message is this: Until you open every nuclear and every military facility to full, open, anytime/anywhere, for real, inspections, we are going to make it as difficult as possible for you to move money around the global financial system.
0.0	0.569047623785	Now, they do charge you tariff on trucks, when we send trucks and other things over there.
0.0	0.315595120976	That cost gets passed on to the people.
0.0	0.612692784363	All I'm saying is our next president has to be someone that undoes the damage Barack Obama has done to this country.
0.0	0.276913929975	May I respond to the critique on the ...
0.0	0.314222056817	We now have a 73,000-page tax code.
0.0	0.30976611359	I went out and said, it's ridiculous.
0.0	0.522019373434	So one of the things I did, and I said, you know what I'll do.
0.0	0.234458465527	I love the Saudis.
0.0	0.68128640573	Why don't we just give a chicken in every pot, while we're, you know, coming up -- coming up with these fantasy tax schemes.
0.0	0.275761867433	I think this is a very difficult issue.
0.0	0.226013685087	...No, sir...
0.0	0.38841517213	You have to ban the people who are trying to hurt us.
0.0	0.3683422438	The government has lied to you and they have stolen from you.
0.0	0.65271632098	But I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost.
0.0	0.273352858627	The threat is Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.642381449032	About every two weeks, he holds a press conference talking about how he can't wait to restrict people's access to guns.
0.0	0.649912791282	Well, I think that they're be pretty smart, because I think a lot of the states will do the right thing, and I think those states that don't will pay a heavy penalty.
0.0	0.258565597602	This issue is not about that anymore.
0.0	0.354822563245	And they will work with me to get comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.418014612214	We have a serious problem with, as you know, with radical Islam.
0.0	0.291995035188	I never said that.
0.0	0.658578338088	Are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the Assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire?
0.0	0.522373282891	And our focus has got to be on intelligence, increased manpower, fighting internationally targets.
0.0	0.588014775116	Chris, I would note that that the last four questions have been, "Rand, please attack Ted.
0.0	0.338184986103	They're tough, they're strong, they're great people.
0.0	0.310408303995	This campaign is not just about electing a president.
0.0	0.545305060476	We have $2.5 trillion outside of the United States which we want to bring back in.
0.0	0.442718884961	And work on a timetable to get rid of Assad, hopefully through Democratic elections.
0.0	0.318887287174	President Obama's policing commission came out with some.
0.0	0.684708114144	And nobody, nobody on either one of these stages has done more than I've done and the people of the State of Texas to deal with securing that border.
0.0	0.662997413529	We don't represent Wall Street, we don't represent the billionaire class, so it ends up I'm the only candidate up here of the many candidates who has no Super PAC.
0.0	0.354544139118	Well, I mean, I was talked about in the question.
0.0	0.659973898555	Not only are deductibles rising, 29 million Americans still have no health insurance and millions of people can't afford to go to the doctor.
0.0	0.395251854105	With a couple of additional tweaks, we know what this will do.
0.0	0.56902965389	They're looking -- they're recruiting people that enter this country as doctors and engineers and even fiances.
0.0	0.666025722903	So they come in, they take our jobs, they take our money, and then they loan us back the money, and we pay them in interest, and then the dollar goes up so their deal's even better.
0.0	0.66437426306	And, you know, take advantage of the tremendous opportunities in energy that God has given us, not get involved in these little petty arguments.
0.0	0.663407565968	Now, there has been a lot of turmoil and trouble as they have tried to deal with these radical elements which you find in this arc of instability, from north Africa to Afghanistan.
0.0	0.336936637566	The natural next question is who actually has done so.
0.0	0.680168447252	Today, we are on pace to have the smallest Army since the end of World War II, the smallest Navy in 100 years, the smallest Air Force in our history.
0.0	0.393919725475	$19 billion of tax cuts, 1.3 million jobs created.
0.0	0.371101795903	But we're running for the presidency of the United States here.
1.0	0.436811099135	I don't recall the Sun -- in fact, the Sun-Sentinel endorsed him.
0.0	0.39585547332	It's saved a lot of lives along the way, Senator.
1.0	0.552891832647	He is the foremost expert in our country on the minimum wage, and what its effects are.
0.0	0.349958525352	I know a lot of Americans are angry about the economy.
0.0	0.41387647601	Because part of this is the startup challenges that this system is facing.
0.0	0.505262547531	The American people have rejected your agenda and now you're trying to go around it.
0.0	0.589228191382	But we need an independent investigation, and I hope Secretary Clinton will agree with me for the need of that.
0.0	0.551131216946	Then he'll call all sorts of political people, and I'll say, "Sorry, fellas.
0.0	0.336161151186	We need to rebuild the military to defeat the enemy.
0.0	0.678381490709	We need a leader that can bring back our jobs, can bring back our manufacturing, can bring back our military, can take care of our vets.
0.0	0.268928839841	Don't believe it.
0.0	0.670569625797	But I want to quickly say, one of the areas that Senator Sanders touched on in talking about education and certainly talking about health care is his commitment to really changing the systems.
0.0	0.600828305665	And the reason is simple: because in 2008, we elected as president someone who wasn't interested in fixing America.
0.0	0.288656419122	Can I just say this...
0.0	0.290607653968	But I guess I'm supposed to come out great.
0.0	0.622170710868	And we fought for statewide school choice, where the dollars follow the child, instead of the child following the dollars.
0.0	0.466899982952	And we're going to be proud every month for the rest of our lives.
0.0	0.328155097278	We have people that have no incentive to work.
1.0	0.575446326408	The average middle-class family will be saving thousands of dollars a year.
0.0	0.508894653407	He doesn't want to get people together, the old-fashioned way, where you get Congress.
0.0	0.231711238002	But I was born here.
0.0	0.33910362608	That is...
0.0	0.67048971306	I think what's interesting about where that liberty vote goes that my father brought to the Republican Party is, I don't think they're necessarily going to go for Ted.
0.0	0.270512080445	We don't win.
0.0	0.588992747022	And that is the danger that democracies find themselves susceptible to when unscrupulous leaders try to turn us upon each other.
0.0	0.281787025119	We hear actually a lot of good intentions.
0.0	0.647364416032	... and in this case, we probably let our lust for regime toppling get ahead of the practical considerations for stability in that region.
0.0	0.663567198332	It has to be based on what skills you have, what you can contribute economically, and most important of all, on whether or not you're coming here to become an American, not just live in America, but be an American.
0.0	0.417072386585	You look at these airports, we are like a third world country.
0.0	0.592275671752	So I've said, if the big banks don't play by the rules, I will break them up.
0.0	0.660784526049	Yes, I do believe that now after the American people bailed Wall Street out, yes, they should pay a Wall Street speculation tax so that we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.593212847198	We need to make sure that we do everything across all kinds of energy: natural gas, oil, absolutely.
0.0	0.254862962618	You just can't do it.
0.0	0.342101975482	We've got to have them be part of our coalition.
0.0	0.28627605039	But, you know what we're not telling them?
0.0	0.285688020246	John, may I -- may I interject here?
0.0	0.656028664588	This is a grassroots campaign and, you know, when I ran for senate in Texas, I told the people of Texas that I'm not going there to go along to get along.
0.0	0.649058120585	You know I understand why Donald made the comments he did and I understand why Americans are feeling frustrated and scared and angry when we have a president who refuses to acknowledge the threat we face and even worse, who acts as an apologist for radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.62791439715	I would say that I would and I have a permit, which is very unusual in New York -- a permit to carry.
0.0	0.261427901247	That's for sure.
0.0	0.296430683914	But what's wrong is your premise in the question.
0.0	0.681623627508	At the same time, law enforcement understands there are people in the community who not only think that the system doesn't work for them, but works against them.
0.0	0.266500108749	We're friends.
0.0	0.564382219308	Well, to start with, unlike President Obama, I'll actually name the enemy that we confront.
0.0	0.261094979256	Where were we attacked?
0.0	0.284819708549	Well, I mean right here.
0.0	0.298789551515	They don't buy their guns from a collector.
0.0	0.537177006488	I will not shock anybody to suggest that in politics there is occasionally a little bit of hypocrisy.
0.0	0.257221046108	That's fine.
0.0	0.659248868845	According to the economists -- who I'm not big believers in, but, nevertheless, this is what they're saying -- that $24 trillion -- we're very close -- that's the point of no return.
0.0	0.284623007801	And what distributes goods better?
0.0	0.281235023653	Kevin, if I could just jump in.
0.0	0.682006680785	So what I say to those people who go to Donald Trump's rallies, understand: He thinks a low minimum wage in America is a good idea.
0.0	0.677443599399	At the time, the liberal governor of Florida, who claimed he was a Republican -- his name was Charlie Crist -- he wanted to impose cap-and-trade on Florida.
0.0	0.355985387013	And we need someone who will take on Hillary Clinton in November.
0.0	0.653767828762	And, sometimes we're held up in contempt by people who write columns, but, I guarantee you to every person on this stage there's something deep inside of us that would cause us to give up our livelihoods and step out on this stage and fight for the people of America.
0.0	0.31407181611	Martha, may I -- Martha, may I...
0.0	0.274745100088	That's a wonderful business model.
0.0	0.267748562453	And I think this is an important question.
1.0	0.538307497953	Barack Obama actually had the poison pill to stop it then.
0.0	0.249853526769	He undermines it.
0.0	0.295537674739	His first election and his re-election.
0.0	0.246735456134	We have problems with Russia.
0.0	0.545925460083	Well, first of all, I didn't say that the rate would be 10 percent.
0.0	0.667661611875	We need, basically, to pledge that we're going to invest in this country, in jobs and education, not more jails and incarceration.
0.0	0.558478778008	So I think that we need to build on the work of the policing commissioner that President Obama impaneled.
0.0	0.659432619491	My proposal is to put a speculation tax on wall street, raise very substantial sums of money, not only make public colleges and universities tuition-free, but also substantially lower interest rates on student debt.
0.0	0.398893632019	Well, there's always a retrospective to say what mistakes were made.
0.0	0.685029815318	When it comes to the audit the Fed bill, as Rand knows well, I was an original sponsor of the bill, I'm strongly supportive of it.
0.0	0.50584676663	I think there is constitutional and legal authority for the president to have done what he did.
0.0	0.515538008549	This is a group of people that enslaves women and sells them, sells them as brides.
0.0	0.665166989444	I've seen so much of it - a Soviet Union, the coming down of a wall, the issues that we saw around the world in Central America, the potential spread of communism, and 9/11 and Gulf War.
0.0	0.676991562731	And that's why we have to use Carl (ph) and we have to use our great businesspeople and not political hacks to negotiate with these guys.
0.0	0.27827368547	It better not be Bernie Sanders.
0.0	0.571904402922	But we have to restore policing that will actually protect the communities that police officers are sworn to protect.
0.0	0.243908781516	Wait for what?
0.0	0.671459842407	And the fact is that we need a commander-in- chief who not only understands how to protect us, but feels in here what it means to face the possibility of loss.
0.0	0.26433889465	We'll go to the Congress.
0.0	0.552140493513	Well, listen, I've spent my entire life defending the Constitution before the U.S. Supreme Court.
1.0	0.637771634317	And, it says blanket amnesty, I do not support blanket amnesty...
0.0	0.259498590998	I'm ready.
0.0	0.298442925717	And so Senator Graham is right about this.
0.0	0.595525931326	I mean, we had to borrow so much money to send them to college and were not the only ones.
0.0	0.663640770818	My heart, like all of us in this room, John, and all the people across our country, my hearts go out to the people of France in this moment of loss.
0.0	0.33910362608	Do it.
0.0	0.262521148469	He couldn't answer the question.
0.0	0.539492855527	When I left the workforce, New York State had been reduced by over 15 percent.
0.0	0.442612883046	One principle, for example, we've got to embrace is on immigration.
0.0	0.29672893721	We want to be the United States of America.
0.0	0.673109320018	But I look at this country today, and I look at how divided we are, I look at how politicians are always posturing and issuing sound bites but never solving problems.
0.0	0.68138735694	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.322477506742	You have small businesses in America that are struggling.
0.0	0.350856132376	... And that I am not a great fan of regime change.
0.0	0.310868498356	So we have a good group of people.
0.0	0.58157472148	Well, look, I believe that we've made great progress as a country with the Affordable Care Act.
0.0	0.333022383621	...
0.0	0.333022383621	...
0.0	0.350865997503	And that's the way my parents came legally in 1956.
0.0	0.669705449549	Well, first of all, let's understand why we are even having this debate and why Donald tapped in to some of that anger that's out there about this whole issue.
0.0	0.34065630002	It's true, and these are the best and the finest.
0.0	0.680878356955	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.335875065109	2,000?
0.0	0.302466216963	By actually doing more for education.
0.0	0.333752385604	He was the only Republican that didn't show up for it.
0.0	0.603346782647	And that's what I hear from some people, "we'll do nothing and it will just be fixed."
0.0	0.27944181794	Those are the hard numbers.
0.0	0.299799140122	And before I say it, I have to say this.
0.0	0.582650714293	You're not going to hear a lot of polished political speech from me, but you will hear the truth.
0.0	0.288966662057	Martha -- I would just repeat that --
0.0	0.251543285785	I think you're --
0.0	0.6550526527	The radical Islamic jihadists, what they want to do is impose their faith upon each and every one of us -- every one of us.
0.0	0.388304405485	Secondly, to go after and dismantle their global network of terrorism.
0.0	0.339499039197	... wants to face Donald Trump in the general election.
0.0	0.670677451684	But where we have a disagreement is that I think if you look at the history of regime changes, you go back to Mossaddegh (ph) in Iran, you go back to Salvador Allende who we overthrew in Chile, you go back to overthrowing Saddam Hussein in Iraq, you go back to where we are today in Syria with a dictator named Assad.
0.0	0.488505060855	One as a marine officer in Iraq, one as an army officer in Afghanistan.
1.0	0.617177347671	It is a simple flat tax where for individuals, a family of four pays nothing on the first $36,000.
0.0	0.580894230803	If you're a Washington lobbyist, if you make your money in and around Washington, things are doing great.
0.0	0.661061932083	The fact is that there was a great effort made by the Obama administration and others to really send a clear message, because we knew that so many of these children were being abused, being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border.
0.0	0.286447117043	That's his first responsibility.
0.0	0.340673549671	There is no money in the Social Security account.
0.0	0.277366316298	My patients are beside themselves.
0.0	0.463515628115	And as president of the United States, it's all about communication, folks.
0.0	0.476165439511	You have no disposable income when you are make 10, 12 bucks an hour.
0.0	0.543921794608	I never said that Ms. Davis should either lose her job or that she had to do it.
0.0	0.533843623904	We're going to have a big, fat beautiful door right in the middle of the wall.
0.0	0.519496813009	As president I will restore and rebuild our military, restore the alliances and keep us safe.
0.0	0.648309920359	And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word.
0.0	0.646550585228	One, with respect to the Central American children, I made it very clear that those children needed to be processed appropriately, but we also had to send a message to families and communities in Central America not to send their children on this dangerous journey in the hands of smugglers.
0.0	0.660044251057	And the reason is, is that I've been a reformer all of my career, fighting to reform welfare, fighting to reform the Pentagon, also being in a position to balance the budget, because that is very, very hard to do.
0.0	0.276366106596	Yes.
0.0	0.631856640129	So what I had to do then is go back and start working on a bill that wasn't the bill that I wanted.
0.0	0.299508826763	Thousands.
0.0	0.291019539517	s entrenched problems head-on.
0.0	0.29296291637	It's interesting that Jeb mentions the book.
0.0	0.33910362608	I do.
0.0	0.283863920304	It's a problem all over the world.
0.0	0.408866687739	But the good news is the next commander-in-chief is standing on this stage.
0.0	0.277667850117	They always keep our equipment.
0.0	0.645053174729	We need, and only the three of us will do this, nobody on the Republican side will even admit there's a problem.
0.0	0.260629747568	Do you remember that, everybody?
0.0	0.50766809284	I think the United States military is operating under rules of engagement that are too strict...
0.0	0.30503759401	The central question in this race is trust.
0.0	0.322311183981	And I know that term gets my Republican friends nervous.
0.0	0.689596160415	So what I would say is not only do we need to be thinking in military terms, but we do our military a disservice when we don't greatly dial up the investment that we are making in diplomacy and human intelligence and when we fail to dial up properly, the role of sustainable development in all of this.
0.0	0.31220959744	But we allowed people to keep health care.
0.0	0.296613230614	We are in a war against ISIS.
0.0	0.269958665202	Neil?
0.0	0.679025567002	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.42147220916	Women are not charged more than men any longer for our health insurance.
0.0	0.28765846709	What that is, is just common sense.
0.0	0.335875065109	No.
0.0	0.270952057151	Take it from your professors...
0.0	0.686328619529	Thousands of thousands -- you look at the number of companies and the number in terms of manufacturing of plans that we've lost -- 50,000 because of China.
0.0	0.50563005536	I didn't get a phone call from Bill Clinton before I jumped in the race.
0.0	0.659311801833	Because, first of all, you may rename the IRS but you are not going to abolishes the IRS, because there has to be some agency that's going to collect your vat tax.
0.0	0.450737418278	We think we're going to do very well in Iowa with the liberty vote.
0.0	0.388961641122	There are many crises that come -- a water crisis in Toledo.
0.0	0.268515835782	It's peanuts.
0.0	0.391975837037	Well, let me just -- let me just say, once again...
1.0	0.691499789751	When I look at the migration, I looked at the line, I said it actually on your show recently, where are the women?
0.0	0.683669526151	We also got rid of their chemical weapons, which was a big help, and we also went after a lot of the shoulder-fired missiles to round them up.
0.0	0.284543636262	So what if children are going hungry?
0.0	0.289814758778	And we need the right people.
0.0	0.358685261554	You know, I think my biggest weakness is exactly the opposite.
0.0	0.389001366298	That tells you right away where he was headed on all of this.
0.0	0.512778672169	And she and I looked at the same evidence coming from the Bush administration regarding Iraq.
0.0	0.285444240917	There must be some way.
0.0	0.658465692439	We can't just allow it to continue on its current path the way that Hillary Clinton wants to do because there'll be major reductions in benefits in the next decade if we do nothing.
0.0	0.507323254435	Someone who has a proven record, who has been tested, who is totally transparent.
0.0	0.650503615333	And I'm the only one up on this stage who back in April put forward a detailed entitlement reform plan that will save over $1 trillion, save Social Security, save Medicare, and avoid this -- avoid what Hillary Rodham Clinton will do to you.
0.0	0.307416945832	People were just being fined to death.
0.0	0.350028897582	So I'm going to come up with the best way forward.
0.0	0.294480777632	He is not the only one.
0.0	0.546315509932	Because if you are, you need to elect someone who's deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.293578527107	And I want to make this our government.
0.0	0.6086419112	You know, 200 years ago, America was founded on this powerful principle that our rights don't come from government.
0.0	0.409865107233	Abroad, we need a coalition that is going to take on ISIS.
0.0	0.299109879891	You can't grow your way out of demographics.
0.0	0.353617752753	I'm joined tonight by two daughters, Tara and Grace.
0.0	0.603932946037	So look, in foreign policy -- in foreign policy, it's strength, but you've got to be cool.

0.0	0.509388673441	Our government belongs to all of us, and not just the hand full of billionaires.
0.0	0.659484987547	There are a lot of training programs and education programs that I think can be streamlined and put into a much better format so that if we do continue them they can be more useful, in public schools, community colleges, and colleges and universities.
0.0	0.307876538944	It's a huge public health challenge.
0.0	0.263583225639	Check it out.
0.0	0.619114164891	The reason that I -- I hate them so much is because every single regulation costs in terms of goods and services.

0.0	0.278548803042	I don't have to, believe it or not.
0.0	0.53925087029	You know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money.
0.0	0.681517616332	And what I said and I think what Governor O'Malley is saying, and I hope you say, is when the middle class of this country is disappearing, when we have massive income and wealth inequality, when we're the only major country on earth not guaranteeing health care to all people, all the issues that the governor talked about, the secretary talked about, those are the issues.
0.0	0.5	Last week, Secretary Carter announced that the Navy's going to be cut again.

0.0	0.581306306835	You have regulations -- I mean, come on, they're affecting everybody here, particularly our small businesses.
0.0	0.602002434278	Today congress decided to take another $150 billion dollars away from Social Security so they can borrow more money.
0.0	0.610530734371	The way that things work in the modern era is actually to gather people around the table and figure these things out.
0.0	0.259871048886	I'll check for you.
0.0	0.359070659541	This deal in Washington is an example of why Washington's broken.
0.0	0.29645292055	But states need to do more as well.
0.0	0.427990176127	But I think it's the right road for us to try to travel.
0.0	0.290659419001	I don't want immigration reform to fail.
0.0	0.374968772035	Of course, we're going to be a nation of immigrants.
0.0	0.459757570336	And -- and -- and the last piece of this, Maria, is this.
0.0	0.569015293112	We also had attacks on two of our embassies in Tanzania, Kenya, when my husband was president.
0.0	0.565349977081	The point I'm making is this, the Federal Government should not be in a lot of things.
0.0	0.678200449317	We need to bring together our European and our Sunni Arab allies, and we need to develop a strategy together to take on ISIS every place that it is around the world, so that together, all of us can take ISIS out, destroy it, and then move on to come back to our country, protect our homeland security and make sure that the American people are safe.
0.0	0.656771575972	And that's how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America.
0.0	0.241173109157	...Chris...
1.0	0.676423789037	And by the way, when I left, there were over 1 million fewer people on welfare in New York state than when I took office...
0.0	0.275813684676	They built the great wall of China.
0.0	0.532451331426	And we can get a lot of them out if we get the government out of our lives.
0.0	0.365309243607	And I think that's a bad idea for the following reason.
0.0	0.338367052365	I just don't think it would get the job done.
0.0	0.663064235087	I have a friend who's a doctor, and he said to me the other day, "Donald, I never saw anything like it.
0.0	0.659809624714	I want those kids to know that if they study hard, they do their homework, regardless of the income of their families, they will in fact be able to get a college education because we are going to make public colleges and universities tuition-free.

0.0	0.284899579644	It's kind of basic.
0.0	0.344769128603	That has not been...
0.0	0.512410119639	Well, our prayers are with the people of France tonight, but that is not enough.
0.0	0.291154569586	We have people out of work.
0.0	0.56546989366	And I would note the other individuals on this stage were nowhere to be found in that fight.
0.0	0.31227645397	We have to stop, and it has to stop now.
0.0	0.552924218097	This has gone on 50 or 60 years where the United States has been involved in overthrowing governments.
0.0	0.664009111586	And I think we've got to be really thoughtful about how we're going to afford what we proposed, which is why everything that I have proposed I will tell you exactly how I'm going to pay for it; including college.
0.0	0.293082044359	It was Countrywide Mortgage.
0.0	0.274721329071	Yes, I apologize.

0.0	0.258553403556	He has gone to China.
0.0	0.282284761684	CRUZL But I will say --
0.0	0.659463917997	No, I think the idea was that president -- then-Senator Obama was wrong for suggesting that it is a good idea to talk to your opponents.
0.0	0.646671847377	Chris, the most important determination any voter is going to make in this election is who's best prepared to be Commander in Chief.
0.0	0.354049059517	We can in fact create jobs and provide job security.
0.0	0.657061459634	We have to be prepared to defend the American people, prepare them for a long war, stand up for the defense of this country, and stand up for the values of this country...
0.0	0.66527473081	He's a good guy, a smart guy, and he would be a heck of a lot better president than Hillary Rodham Clinton would ever be.
0.0	0.342114216238	Not at all.
0.0	0.621289321498	Trying to get Iran and Saudi Arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter.
0.0	0.682544879576	The president of the United States admitting that he's weakening our government's position, our foreign policy standing, because he can't control spending in D.C..
0.0	0.276168834534	Super PACs are a disaster.
0.0	0.434215349777	Well, I just think you're asking a question with a false choice.
0.0	0.30102162224	Senator Cruz is precisely right.
0.0	0.590652578646	I was one -- I was the only -- one of only seven states that had a AAA bond rating.
0.0	0.659191605388	And we would still have governors like Scott Walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions.
0.0	0.643909182331	But what we're seeing happening in Libya right now is that there has been a fragile agreement to put aside the differences that exist among Libyans themselves to try to dislodge ISIS from Sirte, the home town of Gadhafi, and to begin to try to create a national government.
0.0	0.254473761728	So I don't think...
0.0	0.5	And I'll go back to something that had been mentioned just a few minutes ago.
0.0	0.280264426739	They are not our friend, believe me.
0.0	0.659790514985	So a large accounting firm and my accountants have been working for months, because it's big and complex, and they've put together a statement, a financial statement, just a summary.
0.0	0.657594494287	What we have got to do is make it clear that any police officer who breaks the law will, in fact, be held accountable.
0.0	0.332573777841	Why do Americans contribute millions of dollars to charity?
0.0	0.5	For a start, they're going to start to pay their fair share of taxes.
0.0	0.373098350022	And it's got to stop and it's got to stop fast.
0.0	0.590418437777	That will create a true 50-state national marketplace which will drive down the cost of low-cost, catastrophic health insurance.
0.0	0.242738076221	They expect to have it.
0.0	0.616659096398	It's no longer enough just to say the vast majority of Americans want common sense gun safety measures including gun owners.
0.0	0.278067001288	I mean, that's a fact.
0.0	0.654707090505	And based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don't add up, and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now.
1.0	0.693367641325	I have more donations from students and teachers than I do from people associated with Wall Street.
0.0	0.29867899739	It's what happened in Governor O'Malley's state.
0.0	0.684161222892	Because he understands that I'm committed to a fair, and level playing field for every energy source without lobbyists, and without Washington picking winners and losers.
0.0	0.666161197185	But in the interim, in the absence of that, what's happening is some of these tech companies are taking those -- those centers (ph) to Canada because they can get people to go over there instead of here.
0.0	0.445104126904	We're seeing it in my state and we'll see it in this country.
0.0	0.668044495111	If they will begin to turn their military attention away from going after the adversaries of Assad toward ISIS and put the Assad future on the political and diplomatic track, where it belongs.
0.0	0.654162661299	This debate needs to be about the men and women across this country that are struggling on a daily basis to provide for their families the better future that we've always said this country is all about.
0.0	0.483090526428	All we need to do is protect them, they will be in their own country.
0.0	0.677093092443	And in that meeting, I suggested we had a problem with technology, and that I wanted to take people from Silicon Valley into the Pentagon to solve our most significant problems.
0.0	0.591340755412	I am, but people are upset, and they're upset for a reason about the future of this country.
0.0	0.449369059562	Are they going to stand with us against this kind of jihadi radicalism or not?
0.0	0.512565450657	We need, very clearly, major, major reform in a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.60288966823	I think what our campaign is indicating is that the American people are tired of establishment politics, tired of establishment economics.
0.0	0.587282731859	Why do we continue to get ripped off by the drug companies who can charge us any prices they want?
0.0	0.340683758421	We were attacked in downtown Manhattan where Wall Street is.
0.0	0.673152317141	But it's a falseness, and that's an authenticity problem -- that everybody he knows is not as perfect as him because we're all for amnesty.
0.0	0.65540102327	We're not going to be able to rebuild it unless we put a no-fly zone there, make it safe for those folks so we don't have to be talking about Syrian refugees anymore.
0.0	0.507807545514	They're going to end up in the productive economy, which is where we want them.
0.0	0.291402226201	I do think that it's important to defend it.
0.0	0.432145549382	We should have debt-free college if you go to a public college or university.
0.0	0.28151713707	And, they've insinuated themselves into everything.
0.0	0.290604019975	Our vets have been abandoned.
0.0	0.557262576798	I was an Army intelligence agent and a veteran during the Cold War, assigned to West Germany.
0.0	0.544528002218	If I was a Puerto Rican, I'd vote for statehood so that they have full citizenship.
1.0	0.592782988886	They can't get jobs, because there are no jobs, because China has our jobs and Mexico has our jobs.
0.0	0.547421834384	Well, I don't know about the GOP messaging, but I can tell you about my messaging.
0.0	0.672349562341	And I think when you give low-income kids -- African-American, white, Latino kids -- the opportunities to get their lives together, they are not going to end up in jail.
0.0	0.443762778281	I have so many Web sites, I have them all over the place.
0.0	0.676854431435	You know, I have said -- I have said many times, you know, I'm not asking people to support me because I'm a woman.
0.0	0.348296558593	Look, what we need on this issue is not more polls.
0.0	0.428427953331	You know how much money we spent on polio last year in America?
1.0	0.464289929134	Our military is a disaster.
0.0	0.659559890261	So yes, I will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year pay zero, zero in federal income tax.
0.0	0.304580342796	That's not the America that I've ever known.
0.0	0.270866885134	Yeah, but let me respond...
0.0	0.316041313789	I said, "I gotta go into Manhattan.
0.0	0.589191859523	So I put all of this together, again, on my website and I've gotten such a good response.
0.0	0.331104052828	We have a budget closer to $3.5 trillion.
0.0	0.287561835135	We have to put more money.
0.0	0.310013367712	How stupid are these politicians to allow this to happen?
0.0	0.686237704222	And it's because of the flip-flopping, political approach of Washington that both of my two colleagues on this stage have represented there for the last forty years.
0.0	0.292394022226	He has never defended...
0.0	0.642530359731	Doesn't hurt rich people if their bar of soap goes up ten cents, but it hurts the poor and the middle class.
0.0	0.395435851908	They say, " well, we don't really have control."
0.0	0.672654008467	We have ended the terrible situation that people with pre- existing conditions were faced with where they couldn't find at any affordable price health care.
0.0	0.469840621381	I've supported a variety of solutions, both state as well as federal.
1.0	0.260023471925	We passed it after 9/11.
0.0	0.333343684235	This nation is the most powerful military in the world.
0.0	0.667765864942	And in talking to a lot of our neighbors who are in that super wealthy, millionaire and billionaire category, a great numbers of them love their country enough to do more again in order to create more opportunity for America's middle class.
0.0	0.24361900232	SuperPacs are a disaster.
0.0	0.662525139777	I would begin by saying that I'm not sure it's a weakness, but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for America's future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people.
0.0	0.272444935621	Go ahead.
0.0	0.249361011459	That's off the table...
0.0	0.680106799434	I'm asking people to support me because I think I'm the most qualified, experienced, and ready person to be the president and the commander- in-chief.
0.0	0.675144889735	And I think the reason he did is because immigration is sort of an example of what's broken and what's wrong in Washington, D..C.
0.0	0.668818558659	To use the Justice Department, as we just saw, they have said they are going to sue Ferguson, that entered into a consent agreement, and then tried to back out.
0.0	0.340770599341	See, I was there when Reagan rebuilt the military.
0.0	0.277706314051	I know the good ones.
0.0	0.332360623879	Could we loan you $4 billion"?
0.0	0.679773631365	Hopefully after the 2016 election, some of the Republicans will come to their senses and realize we are not going to deport 11 or 12 million people in this country.
0.0	0.53856218825	You know, just two weeks ago was the 25th anniversary of the first Persian Gulf war.
0.0	0.322975153307	We lost thousands of lives, thousands in Iraq.
0.0	0.251965536129	That's who I'm indebted to.
0.0	0.449722766107	You have gotten a whole lot of money over the years from Wall Street.
0.0	0.512555975227	I'm not running against Governor Bush, I'm not running against anyone on this stage.
0.0	0.619499185364	But if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in Flint.
0.0	0.278679700554	Ninety-three hours.
0.0	0.573297638417	But I've also said for the most part, these issues would be left back to the states.
0.0	0.244007098974	And that's what we have to contrast.
0.0	0.420488753753	Sometimes it's a complicated situation, but some things are black and white.
0.0	0.669050227321	We're going to bring jobs back from Japan, we're going to bring jobs back from China, we're going to bring, frankly, jobs back from Mexico where, as you probably saw, Nabisco is leaving Chicago with one of their biggest plants, and they're moving it to Mexico.
0.0	0.650697341772	My mother's dream -- and she died very young, but my mother's dream for her whole life was to be able to get out of that rent-controlled apartment and own a home of her own.
0.0	0.25095880779	That's what really matters.
0.0	0.278904846106	Or somebody else.
0.0	0.54357959606	Listen, in any Republican primary, everyone is going to say they support the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.650135363853	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.567325092812	No radical Islam that is allowed to engage in encouraging violence against Americans, that is not protected speech.
0.0	0.655047480289	And now after seven years of your policies, we have the biggest majority we've had since the 1920s in the House; a Republican majority in the Senate; and 31 out of 50 Republican governors.
0.0	0.599592129393	So what I would say is, number one, we need to be united against the threats that we face.
0.0	0.679982737355	What is important to understand is we have organizations, whether it is ISIS or Al Qaida, who do believe we should go back several thousand years.
0.0	0.666716523533	But the other thing I just wanted quickly to say is, I think President Obama deserves more credit than he gets for what he got done in Washington, despite the Republican obstructionists.
1.0	0.694231157682	They see more people in jail in the United States of America than any other country on earth, 2.2 million.
0.0	0.356079946743	We eliminate the payroll tax, we eliminate the Obamacare taxes.
0.0	0.646080437269	So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives.
0.0	0.519184437877	The United States, at the same time, cannot successfully fight Assad and ISIS.
0.0	0.441237790506	I have been for the Brady bill, I have been against assault weapons.
0.0	0.331500486002	The deployments are too high for the military personnel.
0.0	0.649942881066	So, there does need to be a whole of government approach, but just because we're involved and we have a strategy doesn't mean we're going to be able to dictate the outcome.
0.0	0.645729195245	... you know, the -- the -- the fact of the matter is -- you know, if we fix the taxation system, make it absolutely fair, and get rid of the incredible regulations -- because every regulation is a tax, it's a -- on goods and services.
1.0	0.680554874556	We have the world's best military, even though he's done everything he can to diminish it.

0.0	0.269844639567	Your name wasn't mentioned, Ted.
0.0	0.653425535582	And what we did is try to move that department toward community policing, so that the police officers become part of the community and not, as we see, in some cities an oppressive force.
0.0	0.214346147021	No, he doesn't.
0.0	0.532957134833	I believe that we have got to pass comprehensive immigration reform, something that I strongly supported.
0.0	0.647968982196	This campaign is about the greatest country in the world and a president who has systematically destroyed many of the things that made America special.
0.0	0.291710277187	Well, let's go with three.
0.0	0.660369176108	And if I were president of the United States right now, I'd be lining up our allies to say that, if one crossed T or one dotted I does not occur, they are -- violate the agreement, we slap back on sanctions.
0.0	0.672339875542	Now, on that tariff -- here's what I'm saying, China -- they send their goods and we don't tax it -- they do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.256628867019	We didn't spend any.
0.0	0.685688864476	You have to be hit by a tractor, literally, a tractor, to use it, because the deductibles are so high, it's virtually useless.
0.0	0.321652301865	We're reducing taxes to 15 percent.
0.0	0.242149727169	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.288802249873	So let's set the facts straight.
0.0	0.5784552701	What we should do is to be investing in all types of energy, John, all types of energy.
0.0	0.293191669775	Marco voted on the other side.

0.0	0.295702068848	We both want to get more revenue in.
0.0	0.270308405089	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.676444450116	I have been tried under many different emergencies and I can tell you that in each of those emergencies, whether they were inflicted by drug gangs, whether they were natural emergencies, I knew how to lead and I knew how to govern because I know how to manage people in a crisis and be very clear about the goal of protecting human life.
0.0	0.278735819137	Came out great.
0.0	0.533142690558	The rest of the world is moving away from us towards other alliances because we are weak.
0.0	0.591803280357	I am all in favor of keeping these talented people here so they can go to work in Silicon Valley.
0.0	0.665849667792	You know, some of these -- these engagement rules that the administration has -- "we're not going to bomb a tanker that's coming out of there because there might be a person in it" -- give me a break.
0.0	0.593578546945	It's a 20 percent flat rate tax, it'll take a blowtorch to the -- to the IRS.
0.0	0.351868262352	I want to build on and improve the Affordable Care Act.
0.0	0.360992125182	Well, I have what I call the new college compact.

0.0	0.300997598383	He might be on one of my courses.
0.0	0.491125345506	We're going to have too many people in the cart rather than pulling the cart.
0.0	0.561078447919	As an example, I've been on the circuit making speeches, and I hear my fellow Republicans.
0.0	0.639437193726	The first one would be to my good friend, Bibi Netanyahu, to reassure him we will stand with the State of Israel.
0.0	0.648919375024	I am a conservative; I can win this job, I can do this job, I need your help, I need your support.
0.0	0.275989483516	They're very, very badly wounded.
0.0	0.534476280907	A friend of mine who's a great manufacturer, calls me up a few weeks ago.
0.0	0.460161863647	And kind of -- that's what I see our campaign is about right now.
0.0	0.282496083913	... first of all...
0.0	0.543356519712	In the same light, as the foreign leader, Winston Churchill's politics were not my politics.
0.0	0.359978167293	It will lead to even greater war in this world.
0.0	0.267001417311	We know about the Brits.
0.0	0.285636640932	We ended up with 56 votes.
0.0	0.5	And finally, on health care, why don't we start treating -- keep giving...
0.0	0.272262629065	But I'm going to tell you the truth.
0.0	0.277514569409	And you're not serious about destroying ISIL.
0.0	0.284964384252	I'm never going to change my tune.
0.0	0.62435945853	But what is particularly insulting, though, is that he is the king of saying, "you're for amnesty."
0.0	0.293414071022	We expand Medicare to all people.
0.0	0.688183290823	We haven't come up with an exact number yet, but it will not be as high as the number under Dwight D. Eisenhower, which was 90 percent.
0.0	0.664222643875	RADDATZ: OK. Let's go to talk about the high cost of college education and for that we turn to the executive director of the New Hampshire Institute of Politics, right here at Saint Anselm college, Neil Levesque.
0.0	0.304881234388	And now they are beating us economically.
0.0	0.523341973333	And if you can't use the term, you're never going to solve the problem.
0.0	0.269729858647	You get together.
0.0	0.264336506386	And that was the state of Texas.
0.0	0.65272812586	She wants to continue down the path of Iran, Benghazi, the Russian reset, Dodd-Frank, all the things that have -- that have gone wrong in this country, she would be a national security mess.
0.0	0.284887604078	Our country is in crisis.
0.0	0.618844414812	(APPLAUSE) I think that is the -- I think that's the conservative consensus pragmatic approach to how to solve this problem.
0.0	0.348067297926	That's what I understand is the request from the international...
0.0	0.258810971284	I'm going to do it for America.
1.0	0.594826642532	We are now doing an independent internal investigation to see who else was involved.
0.0	0.548797708081	And what a sad sight that was: Men, women, children forced out of their homes.
1.0	0.307538609995	Two hundred children have been killed.
0.0	0.659573465896	When -- when we put all the facts down, you'll be able to see that it's not true, it works out very well.
0.0	0.288099620358	Of course.
0.0	0.644935551716	We need to have everybody in our country focused on watching what happens and reporting it if it's suspicious, reporting what you hear.
0.0	0.280355801405	It's very bad for us.
0.0	0.652186993816	That's absurd, and I think people who don't want to fix it, really, or unwilling to take the chance to say, "something has to change," are missing the boat here.
0.0	0.250587224962	Thank you, Marco.
0.0	0.33910362608	You do.
0.0	0.620827296276	Why do -- why, over her political career has Wall Street been a major -- the major campaign contributor to Hillary Clinton?
0.0	0.406991067842	They have bridges that make the George Washington Bridge look like small potatoes.
0.0	0.666361084194	Because I think frankly, maybe I'm wrong, but on our worst day, I think we have a lot more to offer the American people than the right wing's extremists.
0.0	0.263612655638	Look, that's who I stand up for.
0.0	0.431510980036	So, we do need to take on the Republicans very clearly and directly.
0.0	0.659031799401	But what happened at the university there, what's happening at other universities, I think reflects the deep sense of, you know, concern, even despair that so many young people, particularly of color, have...
0.0	0.364192731165	So we have to go after this both abroad and at home.
0.0	0.689671842338	When I think about the folks who are out there at home tonight watching, and I think about what they had to watch this week -- the spectacle they had to watch on the floor of the House of Representatives, with the president of the United States, who talked a fantasy land about the way they're feeling.
0.0	0.316714819314	If I was president, I'd say, "Congratulations.
0.0	0.343191306919	The simple fact is that the world has been torn asunder.
0.0	0.303973457785	They are not going to go away on their own.
0.0	0.304352843885	Nobody, nobody will be pushing us around.
0.0	0.677557910975	I mean, what we had was something the government made -- basically a bag of gas -- that cut loose, destroyed everything in its path, left thousands of people powerless, but they couldn't get rid of it because we had too much money invested in it, so we had to keep it.
0.0	0.507275145702	So John, there's a big difference between leading by polls and leading with principle.
0.0	0.286736692068	I need your help.
0.0	0.282455890699	Let me just add to that.
0.0	0.66945854557	I've lived my whole life fighting -- fighting for things that I believe in, fighting for justice and to protect people from crime and terrorism, fighting to stand up for folks who have not had enough and need an opportunity to get more, and to stand up and fight against the special interests.
0.0	0.260063175789	John, could I follow up on this?
0.0	0.322326397535	I hire people, they do a Web site.
0.0	0.268878556262	They're a great family.
0.0	0.360274091678	But I wouldn't even waste my time with this one.
0.0	0.250019140696	I think if it doesn't...
0.0	0.353713621133	I was responsible for the convention center on the west side.
0.0	0.350412214733	It has not been in effect during the administration of Barack Obama.
0.0	0.356578630653	May I jump in here for 30 seconds on health care?
0.0	0.356570874293	Not -- not on that, no.
0.0	0.449973891577	I've done it once in Washington, with great jobs and lower taxes.
1.0	0.240343673871	They stole it.
0.0	0.56839368107	Who denies that it is crazy to allow people to own guns who are criminals or are mentally unstable?
0.0	0.477842838932	If you want someone to grab a beer with, I may not be that guy.
0.0	0.665170537753	I think it's only fair to put on the record, Senator Sanders voted in the Senate for a resolution calling for ending the Gadhafi regime and asking that the U.N. be brought in, either a congressional vote or a U.N. Security Council vote.
0.0	0.653955190123	Well, first let me address the tax issue because it's related to the entitlement issue and I want to thank you for holding a substantive debates where we can have debates about these key issues on taxes.
0.0	0.287582613425	The fact is, there is a big overhang.
0.0	0.481774812788	Our enduring symbol is not the barbed wire fence, it is the Statue of Liberty.
1.0	0.685331273884	And they've stolen from you because now they know they cannot pay these benefits and Social Security is going to be insolvent in seven to eight years.
0.0	0.508812657384	Crony capitalism is alive and well, and has been so in Washington, D.C. for decades.
0.0	0.393381388944	Let me hear if there's any difference between the Secretary and myself.
0.0	0.253628375703	The Syrians should stay in Syria.
0.0	0.683939220908	When I am president, I will work consistently every single day to keep this country safe, not call Edward Snowden, as you did, a great public servant.
0.0	0.422500867768	I don't see a lot of weakness on this stage, quite frankly.
0.0	0.603522507573	I like Chris Christie, but we can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports Common Core.
1.0	0.708009859676	Secondly, I think it's important to point out that about 3 percent of my donations come from people in the finance and investment world.
0.0	0.296326114732	This ties into campaign finance reform.
0.0	0.66812218496	But when we talk about Wall Street, you have Wall Street and major banks have paid $200 billion in fines since the great crash.
0.0	0.491972431632	Well, this is going to be a show me, don't tell me election.
0.0	0.323490812128	They attacked us in San Bernardino two weeks ago.
0.0	0.297380548341	I want security for this country.
1.0	0.677835008837	I would note that Art Laffer, Ronald Reagan's chief economic adviser, has written publicly, that my simple flat tax is the best tax plan of any of the individuals on this stage cause it produces economic growth, it raises wages and it helps everyone from the very poorest to the very richest.
0.0	0.290094233846	They want those planes made in China.
0.0	0.263291385977	Well, they're glitches because...
0.0	0.250031220564	I'm too trusting.
0.0	0.266389077023	And, folks, we will.
0.0	0.261806711016	John.
0.0	0.585153837686	And I would note the Senate just a few weeks ago voted to suspend refugees from Middle Eastern countries.
0.0	0.626242338447	I had to answer every single question about every single result and every single projection in public until there were no more questions.
0.0	0.266936198997	But the poll numbers have.
0.0	0.240671380556	... What was your question...
0.0	0.679300708683	But -- if for some reason, Neil, he beats the rest of the field, I already know the Democrats are going to be bringing a suit.
0.0	0.285885294232	Gronkowski is still going strong.
0.0	0.292253456705	They elected moderate leaders.
0.0	0.252729047771	But it will be...
0.0	0.288264164099	Planned Parenthood will be defunded.
0.0	0.281511498878	Nobody can do that like me.
0.0	0.668331691091	You joined the Senate in voting to get rid of Gadhafi, and you asked that there be a Security Council validation of that with a resolution.
0.0	0.316043869852	Well, but you changed the -- in the book...
0.0	0.660917044315	But if I get elected president I will bring it back bigger and better and stronger than ever before, and we will make America great again.
0.0	0.470399451204	Bring the money -- the $2 trillion -- back to the United States.
0.0	0.580445064266	Let me just say on taxes, how long have we been talking about tax reform in Washington, D.C.?
0.0	0.423590026122	It was a back sacrifice, and I have to hand it to Ben.
0.0	0.682619155971	And so, now that, I think, you know, we have resolved your data, we have agreed on an independent inquiry, we should move on.
0.0	0.277538756483	It continues with regulatory reform.
0.0	0.310214072749	... they don't like the Wall Street Journal.
0.0	0.553399095578	So I want us to have a very tough screening process but I want that process to go forward.
0.0	0.268873830199	The answer is simple.
1.0	0.515980526149	I have vetoed a reduction this clip size.
1.0	0.297285019913	I did introduce legislation to reign in compensation.
0.0	0.315265834315	There is a better way to provide health care.
0.0	0.304627534065	It's time for real substance and real experience.
0.0	0.653422471505	What we ought to do is tighten up our efforts to deal with the entry visa program so that a citizen from Europe, it's harder if they've been traveling to Syria or traveling to these other places where there is Islamic terrorism, make it harder -- make the screening take place.
0.0	0.667382016133	It is because in this nation, we are influenced by Judeo-Christian values that teach us to care for the less fortunate, to reach out to the needy, to love our neighbor.
0.0	0.332012043096	I have a difference of opinion with Secretary Clinton on this.
0.0	0.414198812577	If you take donations from Wall Street, you can't be independent.
0.0	0.267220017083	On welfare.
0.0	0.270437119	I like it.
0.0	0.685681659211	13 Hours -- tomorrow morning, a new movie will debut about the incredible bravery of the men fighting for their lives in Benghazi and the politicians that abandoned them.
0.0	0.455246738488	I was there in '89 when the wall came tumbling down because we were strong.
0.0	0.573282784001	We need a ground force in Iraq and Syria, and America has to be part of that ground force.
0.0	0.314124578857	I think that is the number one requirement.
0.0	0.304028675233	Many are in this building.
0.0	0.564209123059	We've worked hard our whole life to provide a better family -- a better life for our family.
0.0	0.65404277879	But the key thing that we're seeing now is serious challenges to this country that must change, the direction of this nation must change.
0.0	0.276633045422	You gotta be patient.
0.0	0.426880341709	Hillary Clinton this week said Barack Obama would make a great Supreme Court justice.
0.0	0.542252418353	Well, with respect to Syria, I really do appreciate the efforts that Secretary Kerry has made.
0.0	0.259164664333	Okay, thank you.
0.0	0.670842853432	And, I'll note finally, Chris, there is a reason that Iowa's Congressman Steve King, perhaps the fiercest defender of farmers in this state, is sharing my campaign.
0.0	0.476794122571	We have to work with NATO to protect Eastern Europe against any kind of Russian aggression.
0.0	0.268245077665	OK?
0.0	0.254473761728	I don't think so.
0.0	0.661476634312	I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators -- back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.
0.0	0.5997573127	In my view healthcare is a right of all people, not a privilege, and I will fight for that.
0.0	0.608717604806	We can slap on sanctions alone, on day one, but it's not gonna be anywhere near as effective.
0.0	0.644172281927	I would like to take a hard look at every part of the federal government and really do the kind of analysis that would rebuild some confidence in people that we're taking a hard look about what we have, you know, and what we don't need anymore.
0.0	0.278862500711	The planes are older than the pilots.
0.0	0.590200031899	Well, and specifically to Medicare, Becky, because 85 percent of the cost of Medicare is chronic disease.
0.0	0.279894451301	Can I -- can I -- I just...
0.0	0.581884811312	I think he has addressed a lot of these issues that have been quite difficult, but he has gone forward.
0.0	0.600249699325	There're families all across America who aren't able to contribute to our economy because of this crushing student loan.
0.0	0.268920141472	Not good.
0.0	0.238871216963	Thank you.
0.0	0.684828832436	It has to be with our friends in the Arab world and our friends in Europe, the coalition that we had when we went to the first Gulf War.
0.0	0.556081805854	Please go to hillaryclinton.com and be part of making this country what we know it can and should be.
0.0	0.683930210342	In fact, in the last debate, very shamefully, she tried to hide her cozy relationship with Wall Street big banks by invoking the attacks of 9/11.
0.0	0.563480160131	And, indeed, my tax plan that I've introduced, it's available on our website.
0.0	0.249523800984	They shouldn't be going to Europe.
0.0	0.660324868288	I've heard about tax schemes that don't add up, that put our kids in -- in a deeper hole than they are today.
0.0	0.655841054991	I feel very strongly that we have to reform our criminal justice system and we have to find ways to try to bring law enforcement together again with the communities that they are sworn to protect.
0.0	0.582451168671	And as I looked out there at the eyes of our neighbors, I also looked in the eyes of veterans.
0.0	0.666209667278	There is no president, in my view, not Hillary Clinton, not Bernie Sanders, who has the capability or the power to take on Wall Street, large campaign donors, the corporate media, the big money interests in this country alone.
0.0	0.28764055177	And, I'll do that with the country.
0.0	0.648545067221	She admitted she had sent e-mails to her family saying, "Hey, this attack at Benghazi was caused by Al Qaida-like elements."
0.0	0.605170962049	You'll see me on the floor of the Senate tomorrow filibustering this and saying enough is enough, no more debt.
0.0	0.646180578288	So please, do not explain to me, coming from a state where democratic governors and republican governors have supported virtually no gun control.
1.0	0.479359752658	And again, paid for.
0.0	0.337957671779	I think, though, government is too big now.
0.0	0.272924783507	They're right about that, but I'm doing it.
0.0	0.657592588084	One of the best things that was done, and George W. Bush did this and I give him credit, was to reach out to Muslim Americans and say, we're in this together.
0.0	0.282277018979	Look, we have to stop with political correctness.

0.0	0.681370159924	I want to speak to all the moms and dads whose sons and daughters are fighting for this country, and the incredible sense of betrayal when you have a commander-in-chief who will not even speak the name of our enemy, radical Islamic terrorism, when you have a commander-in- chief who sends $150 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, who's responsible for murdering hundreds of our servicemen and women.

0.0	0.539739092958	The biggest tax increase happened under the watch of Barack Obama, and spending's gone up.
0.0	0.476288688039	I believe this is still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.

0.0	0.60199685874	Well, first, I was critical of the Senators not giving the authorization for the use of military force.
0.0	0.680182841381	Well, I've been talking to a lot of these families, and this is such an outrage, both because it's bad for our economy, we're a 70 percent consumption economy, people need to feel optimistic and confident, they need to believe their hard work is going to be rewarded, and it's bad for our democracy.
0.0	0.627365486621	And I took on the drug companies and I took on the insurance companies to try to get us universal health care coverage.

0.0	0.282774606553	A rich person does not.

0.0	0.411771520289	Well, as anyone knows who's been listening to me, you know?
0.0	0.387756449779	We've cut taxes, balanced budgets, changed the regulatory environment.
0.0	0.488814875782	We should put the NSA in charge of the civilian side of this as well.

0.0	0.279113594302	Believe me, folks.
0.0	0.656723757589	And what I think all of us are saying is, our monetary policy, our tax policy, regulatory policy needs to be radically changed so we can create high sustained growth for income to rise.
0.0	0.29536487657	Two quick responses.
0.0	0.486677491825	It's going to happen in this country, there are going to be further attacks.
1.0	0.691853841821	And the reason I said that is because the FBI director told the American people, told Congress, that he could not guarantee he could vet them and it would be safe.
0.0	0.273012524539	Now we hear the tough talk.
0.0	0.276366106596	Yes.
0.0	0.214346147021	They didn't do that.
0.0	0.240023836283	And I've been there.
0.0	0.34744978885	That's what it is.
0.0	0.271552226352	It's harder to talk to your enemies.
0.0	0.307441971658	We need to end minimal sentencing.
0.0	0.574728280176	And, you know the old inscription, if you save one life, you've changed the world.
0.0	0.655642162943	I believe that we need to cut these taxes down, we need to be on a roadmap to balancing the budget, and we need to send power, money, and influence, the welfare department, the education department, job training, infrastructure, Medicaid, all of that out of Washington back to the states so we can run these programs from where we live to the top, not a one size fits all mentality that they have in Washington.
1.0	0.334634519507	A $5 billion Web site.
0.0	0.412024353338	We were proud of them on graduation day, weren't we, Katie?
0.0	0.31254909281	So when Nikki said that, I wasn't offended.
0.0	0.545112502676	And we're letting them get away with it and we can't let them get away with it.
0.0	0.282427164029	That's the future of banking in America.
0.0	0.660037117026	I'm very proud of the fact that we have more than 750 thousand donors, and the vast majority of them are giving small contributions.
0.0	0.306551767841	I don't want campaign contributions from corporate America.
0.0	0.265690392377	That's the end of the conversation.
0.0	0.652956484432	If you believe that our country's problems and the threats that we face in this world can only be met with new thinking, new and fresh approaches, then I ask you to join my campaign.
0.0	0.299496720653	But bottom line is: The president is right.
0.0	0.688631622996	I tried (ph), early in my marriage, explaining to my wife why someone named Sallie Mae was taking $1,000 out of our bank account every month.
0.0	0.376061951374	No interest," because I don't need anybody's money.
0.0	0.36334532358	I just want to remind you, people paid their money.
0.0	0.673269081333	In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense.
0.0	0.281428796533	And I say that to Nikki.
0.0	0.599115930184	It's their time to bail out the middle class, help our kids be able to go to college tuition-free.
0.0	0.563478439287	From my perspective, we have to prevent the Republicans from rolling back the progress that we've made.
0.0	0.367358964418	When was the last time you heard China is killing us?
0.0	0.296921165069	That never works.
0.0	0.652823268817	The contrast with the Democratic debate, where every fawning question from the media was, "Which of you is more handsome and why?"
0.0	0.671735273672	You see, because if you really want to get to a balanced budget, you need to reduce your expenses and you need to grow your economy.
0.0	0.619781167014	But the ideal scenario is to train Americans to do the work so we don't have to rely on people from abroad.
0.0	0.660937572669	And, you know, there are a number of programs that I think are duplicative and redundant and not producing the results that people deserve.
0.0	0.294625403176	Well, I'm glad you asked that, Maria.
0.0	0.332422192774	And, we come out here, and we do our thing.
0.0	0.295720868625	But look at that border with Saudi Arabia.
0.0	0.304486858214	And we have to take on ISIS online.
0.0	0.401333727488	Disparaging women, disparaging hispanics, that's not a sign of strength.
0.0	0.659170646767	And the fact is that what I did do, what I did do from the beginning, Chris, as soon as I found out about it, I fired the people who were responsible.
0.0	0.317027052523	Someone's going to be collecting this tax.
0.0	0.290909661209	That means everything.
0.0	0.279807453785	You look at the patches and the 40-year-old floor.
0.0	0.314810321137	Our country is being run by incompetent people.
0.0	0.647848131707	Well, to put that in a context, Judy, I think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top one-tenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled.
0.0	0.247119589899	So I would say, "Congratulations.
0.0	0.64242886134	And if you really want to believe that you can get your voice back, I will tell you, as I have all my career, I will continue to fight for you, because you're the ones that built this country, and will carry it into the future.
0.0	0.29780255108	Obama broke every rule of negotiation.
0.0	0.260103900249	And that is wrong.
0.0	0.670478591759	Donald is right that China is running over President Obama like he is a child, President Obama is not protecting American workers and we are getting hammered.
0.0	0.287412815354	They will be our early warning signal.
0.0	0.683620905943	If you -- we will not solve our nation's problems by resorting to the divisive ideologies of our past, or by returning to polarizing figures from our past.
0.0	0.644137425906	No, it would have to go through the Congress, and I know the White House has actually been working with members of Congress.
0.0	0.276125316858	I want a job."
1.0	0.681284150616	But we have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977.
0.0	0.6264294549	In fact, one of the big banks came to me and said, "Donald, you don't have enough borrowings.
0.0	0.291571307929	They beat us all the time.
0.0	0.658953102416	There are other ways to lead and to be a moral leader in this world, rather than at the opposite end of a drone strike.
0.0	0.554166435011	ISIS is a group that burns people alive in cages; that sells off little girls as brides.
0.0	0.675331178501	This is about people's lives, and we should level with the American people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare.
0.0	0.336230330105	But we also need to reform Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.263405308913	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.684218311211	We have to support the fighters on the ground, principally the Arabs and the Kurds who are willing to stand up and take territory back from Raqqa to Ramadi.
0.0	0.301524205107	White people?
0.0	0.321292856476	... you had two 110-story buildings come crashing down.
0.0	0.312657863677	We've enacted it in our state.
0.0	0.598189928996	In fact, drove down to three of the four lowest years on record police use of lethal force.
0.0	0.529701019622	You learn to constantly evaluate and understand the nature of the threats that you are being faced with.
0.0	0.681221767676	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.561504203579	And I ask everyone in America to call Congress tomorrow and say enough is enough; no more debt.
0.0	0.434364037287	And I don't think you have to be a politician to tell the truth.
0.0	0.320957157707	Simply expanding Medicaid does not improve health care outcomes.
0.0	0.515738386197	And I was on the front lines of that, looking into the eyes of my neighbors...
0.0	0.287807203204	You have a problem with ISIS.
0.0	0.26450032516	My oldest daughter's a teacher.
0.0	0.330068897948	It makes it impossible for our companies to compete, impossible.

0.0	0.329919874455	All without any government mandates whatsoever through the marketplace.
0.0	0.308224898872	But what happened is a political vacuum developed.
0.0	0.632668336733	But I also think that these are very serious times; 75 percent of the American people think the federal government is corrupt.
0.0	0.586493981049	And nobody watching at home believed that any of the moderators had any intention of voting in a Republican primary.
0.0	0.304779618579	You want to see a war on women?
0.0	0.684676979135	And we should never be convinced to give up those freedoms in exchange for a promise of greater security; especially from someone as untried and as incompetent as Donald Trump.
0.0	0.340018605141	Our labor participation rate was the worst since 1978.
0.0	0.307162579625	And we have -- and let me make this promise.

0.0	0.402004240304	This is why, fundamentally, we have to take our government back.
0.0	0.682974722656	If we elect Hillary Clinton, the next four years will be worse than the last eight, and our children will be the first Americans ever to inherit a diminished country.
0.0	0.660517516007	Look, I am in the establishment because my dad, the greatest man alive was president of the United States and my brother, who I adore as well as fantastic brother was president.
0.0	0.260141239118	Why didn't they call?
0.0	0.361471306089	John, I would disagree with Secretary Clinton respectfully on this score.
0.0	0.306067173502	But I do believe that is a minimum.
0.0	0.274971754212	And I'll tell you, it was heartbreaking.
0.0	0.678825546521	But also the biggest people (ph) -- now I've used that to my advantage as a business man, for my family, for myself.
0.0	0.262665333005	Sorry.
0.0	0.476929143194	Before this, I was a very successful person as a developer and as a businessman.
0.0	0.368461014658	David, there are wider vulnerabilities than when it comes to refugees.
0.0	0.470860589595	Not just the hacking of OPM, but that is -- that is just shameful.
0.0	0.282444694354	That would be a disaster for this country.
0.0	0.320353877202	Last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee.
1.0	0.677037392634	He told the police, "I did it because I was inspired by ISIS," and to this day, the White House still refuses to acknowledge it had anything to do with terror.
0.0	0.470931703977	I believe in government, but I believe in efficient government, not wasteful government.
0.0	0.658411899052	And I'll tell you what a weakness is of this country: there are a lot of people who are sick and tired because Washington does not play by the same rules that the American people have to play by.
0.0	0.331440748986	This is not the type of campaign that we run.
0.0	0.371853920432	We got a military that needs equipment all over the place.
0.0	0.655962214734	Well, first of all, we're running a $2 billion dollar surplus, we're not having a revenue problem right now.
0.0	0.52268723276	And that this world, with American leadership, can and must come together to destroy them.
1.0	0.547392923899	Number one, States have been dis-investing in higher education.
0.0	0.65352731056	And you had better get rid of them, because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.650682642626	More importantly, I want kids in Burlington, Vermont, or Baltimore, Maryland, who are in the sixth grade or the eighth grade, who don't have a lot of money, whose parents -- like my parents -- may never have gone to college.
0.0	0.342114216238	So did you.
0.0	0.279637561612	Yes, they control them.
0.0	0.277577518825	Renegotiate our foreign trade deals.
0.0	0.416632713545	We do not have to have massive levels of income and wealth inequality.
0.0	0.644730164775	If my memory is correct, I think when we saw children coming from these horrendous, horrendously violent areas of Honduras and neighboring countries, people who are fleeing drug violence and cartel violence, I thought it was a good idea to allow those children to stay in this country.
0.0	0.66174726061	And in fact, Kissinger's actions in Cambodia, when the United States bombed that country, overthrew Prince Sihanouk, created the instability for Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge to come in, who then butchered some 3 million innocent people, one of the worst genocides in the history of the world.
0.0	0.51703830291	I was a mayor for eight years, worked very closely with a great police department.
0.0	0.68161872412	How about we get the government to do what they're supposed to be doing, secure our borders, protect our people, and support American values and American families.

0.0	0.275466690833	Martha, if I may...
0.0	0.416000941316	And I just couldn't agree -- disagree more with those kinds of comments.

0.0	0.58826268126	We had this failed red line with Assad and it discouraged folks that want to help us on the ground.

0.0	0.287775111364	Let the states do this.

0.0	0.284023184739	Becky --
0.0	0.681757713751	And it bothers me very much that, rather than working on this issue to resolve it, it has become many press releases from the Clinton campaign later.
0.0	0.591106373384	Well, first of all, I had a national reporter say, you know, there's three lanes.
0.0	0.317220429045	That's why I ask for your support for president.
0.0	0.271792806998	John, I'll tell you something.
0.0	0.673549504511	Sometimes it's because the Federal Reserve kept interest rates so low that the wealthy were able to invest in -- in strong assets like the stock market when everybody else was left behind.
0.0	0.407557273687	I think maybe my greatest weakness is that I trust people too much.

0.0	0.367018000259	Probably, I don't know -- you people write the stuff.
0.0	0.510311222545	Well, I wish you would have asked that question years ago when they broke it.
1.0	0.669223772356	And yes, we did ask everyone -- the top 14 percent of earners in our state to pay more in their income tax and we were the only state to go four years in a row without a penny's increase to college tuitions.
0.0	0.393873486722	I have been a strong ally with him on virtually every issue.
0.0	0.276366106596	Yes.
0.0	0.24895769423	They have no choice.
0.0	0.619369275899	I want to use that same up here, whatever it may be to make America rich again and to make America great again.
0.0	0.291487004169	...Or, even some famous Colorado brownies.
0.0	0.659408096143	As a matter of fact, if you're Hispanic or African-American in Texas, you have the number one high school graduation rates in America.
0.0	0.68842458328	And I believe I can, because I have a proven record, a record of accomplishment, a record of cutting taxes, of shrinking the government, of reforming education, of challenging the status quo, eliminating career civil service protections, shrinking the government workforce by 11 percent, but leading the nation in job growth.
0.0	0.477343667736	I'm doing that to say that that's the kind of thinking our country needs.
0.0	0.614128765849	My Muslim friends, some, said, "thank you very much; we'll get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.353002417056	It became popular after the attack in Paris, and San Bernardino.
0.0	0.644699480676	So they clearly think I'm going to do what I say I will do and you can look at what I did in the Senate.
0.0	0.389613510621	I know everyone else on this stage hopes to earn your support.
0.0	0.311828208735	And I was clear about that at the time.
0.0	0.660280412019	But I recall when Secretary Clinton ran against then-Senator Obama, she was critical of him for suggesting that maybe you want to talk to Iran, that you want to talk to our enemies.
0.0	0.275279961342	Judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.59154527853	I'm running for president because I'm going to create an economy that works for working families not just billionaires.

0.0	0.477291539517	... that suspends all refugees from nations that ISIS or Al Qaida controls significant territory.
0.0	0.280149203232	It never happens.

0.0	0.273965503018	I changed it in New Jersey.
0.0	0.542627453523	In other words, the very rich are getting richer, almost everybody is going -- getting poorer.
0.0	0.318545033094	All right, look, this has been a great debate.
1.0	0.337336727492	7 percent and 8 percent to go to college?
0.0	0.270194211356	Well, I don't know.
0.0	0.357207761659	Secondly, I don't believe in free tuition for everybody.
0.0	0.650710421468	In my view, we have got to see that weapons designed by the military to kill people are not in the hands of civilians.
0.0	0.603180315531	According to the FBI and the director of national intelligence, Syria's becoming a perfect platform to strike our nation.
0.0	0.382905341195	Low income people who are not involved in the political process.
0.0	0.281431822431	As a Catholic, that's what I want to do.
0.0	0.439681658993	They lost a lot of money, everybody said it couldn't be done.
0.0	0.313749496835	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.542135415353	These folks, CNBC, they had it down at three, three and a half hours.
0.0	0.662969807146	Target the efforts for people that are committing crimes with guns, and if you do that, and get it right, you're going to be much better off than creating a political argument where there's a big divide.
0.0	0.329981227145	I know personally how extraordinary and unique this nation is.
0.0	0.600947718375	And when you led the charge with the Gang of Eight, I supported it because you asked me to.
0.0	0.249977838702	But here's what's going to happen:
1.0	0.619356102871	They knew that they were talking about trying to take our country and attack it.
0.0	0.494525734748	It is a different, fundamental military strategy than what we've seen from Barack Obama.
0.0	0.303555054642	In fact, he's done worse than nothing.
0.0	0.531789391016	That means pass the Paycheck Fairness Act so we have transparency about how much people are making.
0.0	0.274301614461	I think any parent would be so proud of them.
0.0	0.360436116995	But the United States is not the policeman of the world.
0.0	0.238617128227	I wish he was here.
0.0	0.291316463589	But it cannot be an American fight.
0.0	0.656913930187	But I'll tell you what would have happened, if we had not joined with our European partners and our Arab partners to assist the people in Libya, you would be looking at Syria.
0.0	0.270408948416	I'm wearing a Trump tie tonight.
0.0	0.676749304574	What we need to do is lead an international coalition which includes very significantly the Muslim nations in that region who are going to have to fight and defend their way of life.
0.0	0.423710145411	So I think we need radical changes in the funding of higher education.
0.0	0.292892572159	You know, I think abortion is always wrong.
0.0	0.390070695627	The age will have to gradually rise, there is no question.

0.0	0.241873081974	He was a great negotiator.
0.0	0.40790595438	Chris, let's begin by being clear what this campaign is about.
0.0	0.523872755105	They need to learn English, adopt our values, roll up their sleeves and get to work.
0.0	0.577632707898	I've laid out a very aggressive plan to reign in Wall Street -- not just the big banks.
0.0	0.285104435663	Let me just say this.
0.0	0.273489832276	Please reconsider, I'll say no.
0.0	0.469840982871	And it creates a -- a contempt for the law, for the rule of law.
0.0	0.266442655828	He didn't know.
0.0	0.276366106596	Yes.
0.0	0.62296146125	It should follow the principles of expanding competition, empowering patients, and keeping government from getting in between us and our doctors.
0.0	0.633430886332	This is about more than replacing a D with an R. We need a leader who will help us take our government back.
0.0	0.436768033244	But this cannot be an American fight, although American leadership is essential.
0.0	0.52930543484	The idea of 401(k)s. I have a small business that I set up.
0.0	0.669051889021	We took the growth of Medicaid from over 10 percent in my second budget to 2.5 percent, without cutting off one person or cutting one benefit, because we -- we innovated the government.
0.0	0.344769128603	And here's why.
0.0	0.662899055752	Secretary Clinton has been going around the country saying Bernie Sanders wants to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, people are going to lose their MedicAid, they're going to lose their CHIP program.
0.0	0.31792533633	I am still sick and tired of Hillary Clinton's e-mails.
0.0	0.340626161799	Do you really think that these people are interested in Yemen?
0.0	0.322912774645	But it was also the cascading effects that followed that.
0.0	0.304464692317	She is the best parent and grandmother that I know.
0.0	0.634936368561	And we fell into the same trap with Assad, saying -- as if it's our job to say, Assad must go.
0.0	0.415213514338	... and when I'm president, we are keeping ISIS out of America.
0.0	0.276032924095	I'm proud that I gave him that advice.
0.0	0.224734379444	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.686163261887	And she is just one or two more poll drops down from even moving further left than she's moved already to get to the left of Bernie on this.
0.0	0.672688897996	I watch the speeches of these people, and they say the sun will rise, the moon will set, all sorts of wonderful things will happen.
0.0	0.304314731122	In fact, that's part of the problem.
0.0	0.547385633777	I want to go back to what we were talking about earlier, this budget deal in Washington.
0.0	0.343765027628	And remember the $5 billion Web site?
0.0	0.576898870289	But if that's the best the New York Times has got, they better go back to the well.
0.0	0.646104301463	And, it turns out that up until -- and this has blown me away, never in a million years would I have believed that I would be standing here tonight telling you that we have received three and a half million individual contributions from well over a million people.
