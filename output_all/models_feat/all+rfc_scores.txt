0.0	0.5	And God only knows Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator.
0.0	0.456157475126	When it comes to fossil fuels, we're going to find more here and use less.
0.0	0.676776639067	Well, to put that in a context, Judy, I think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top one-tenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled.
0.0	0.223021391706	I actually have a plan.
0.0	0.628873786872	Now you are a worker, white worker, black worker, who had a decent job, that manufacturing job is gone.
0.0	0.248005792364	Let me conclude by just saying this.
0.0	0.663502588494	You know, 200 years ago, America was founded on this powerful principle that our rights don't come from government.
0.0	0.431134180918	Karen and I have seven children.
0.0	0.199675907916	And the reason -- and the reason...
0.0	0.597139057328	This president, this president is more interested in funding -- less interested in funding the military, than he is in funding planned -- he's more interested in funding Planned Parenthood than he is in funding the military.
0.0	0.203167817474	Well, that's easy to answer.
0.0	0.252101882962	What we have to start thinking about, as leaders, particularly in government, is what can we do for the average American?
0.0	0.272518014852	In addition to that...
0.0	0.380889536288	If we do not know who you are, and we do not know why you are coming when I am president, you are not getting into the United States of America.
0.0	0.237870935276	Yeah.
0.0	0.203421659287	You don't know it, they tax us.
0.0	0.627257424839	Last week, Secretary Carter announced that the Navy's going to be cut again.
0.0	0.767645848719	Three million women have fallen into poverty under this administration.
0.0	0.299548493083	And we're going to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	0.172392153041	I've learned from him that what we need to achieve is peace through strength, which means we need to rebuild the military.
0.0	0.256613502993	And he said, oh, I'm never going to attack.
0.0	0.398677369202	But getting back to Martha's question about how we end dependency, do we have to have a cultural change?
0.0	0.219486522904	I will tell you that.
0.0	0.298298109772	You ought to just be able to get over it, get used to it...
0.0	0.223482799789	Thank you.
0.0	0.319654789338	They do it to us, we don't it.
0.0	0.534244838888	What he said, and he said it in the last debate, it's simply not true.
0.0	0.412839092035	And not only did I fight them, but I beat them.
0.0	0.352034350286	We need to re-establish the relationships with the Sunnis.
0.0	0.22238303246	(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
0.0	0.648191411085	It's the reason why I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and led the fight to stop the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, because it was clear then, like it's clear now, that border security is national security.
0.0	0.343161349549	Bill, I want to say one more thing about...
0.0	0.311535877595	I'm not -- my campaign is going to be about the future of America, it's not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage.
0.0	0.189086744122	I like it.
0.0	0.358721635023	I think he would have said bring back a 21st-century Glass-Steagall legislation.
0.0	0.416864601877	The fact of the matter is he doesn't realize that we now live in the 21st century, and that war is very different than it used to be before.
0.0	0.273456011959	Our greatest days lie ahead if we are willing to do what it takes now.
0.0	0.444232221125	And Bernie Sanders will tell them that it's because of the rich.
0.0	0.548356292265	Middle class may notice it when they get to the cash register.
0.0	0.483812309114	Are you fed up with how Washington wastes your money?
0.0	0.212934318745	It's a joke.
0.0	0.264070279765	Here, we actually need 1,000 because we have natural barriers.
0.0	0.277649657913	And as president, I will rebuild the military and keep this country safe.
0.0	0.793894704689	He used chemical weapons, he's killed, now, over a quarter of a million of his own people, and this president has done nothing.
0.0	0.627263297457	And that is what they told me when I was in Jordan in November.
0.0	0.18402002401	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.644299620783	And, sometimes we're held up in contempt by people who write columns, but, I guarantee you to every person on this stage there's something deep inside of us that would cause us to give up our livelihoods and step out on this stage and fight for the people of America.
0.0	0.440234775366	It is a constitutional right of every American to be able to protect themselves and their families.
0.0	0.407690185926	We have got to destroy their training camps and recruiting centers.
0.0	0.333884747122	So many companies are going to leave our country.
0.0	0.319016052778	But the ideal scenario is to train Americans to do the work so we don't have to rely on people from abroad.
0.0	0.183226116849	We need fundamental police reform, clearly, clearly, when we talk about a criminal justice system.
0.0	0.430226725788	Neil, my name was mentioned as well.
0.0	0.424500635923	Governor Huckabee's exactly right, we need to honor the promises made to our seniors, but for younger workers -- look.
0.0	0.286552555016	So, let's stop fooling around about this, let's tell people the truth.
0.0	0.445950957957	We're not going to be able to rebuild it unless we put a no-fly zone there, make it safe for those folks so we don't have to be talking about Syrian refugees anymore.
0.0	0.688800523496	When he meets with the attorney general in the White House, it's not "how can we protect the Second Amendment rights of Americans."
0.0	0.685804052577	Well, you just -- you just listed a litany of discredited attacks from Democrats and my political opponents, and I'm not gonna waste 60 seconds detailing them all.
0.0	0.550181895701	It's the same thing that I did in Ohio.
0.0	0.209844169038	They don't want them made here.
0.0	0.47672014583	And you combine that with reforms of our welfare system.
0.0	0.179489962078	We are not the world's policeman, but we need to stand up and be ready.
0.0	0.751665690217	And with respect to the 2007 bill, this was Ted Kennedy's bill.
0.0	0.583780856646	We had a decision to make early on, do we do a Super PAC?
0.0	0.339367153314	Well, there is no evidence that they can fix anything in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.393187815896	I will do everything I can to make certain that the United States and our brave men and women in the military do not get bogged down in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.
0.0	0.26309852045	I have a debt to America I'll never repay.
0.0	0.719655920849	Unfortunately, Governor Christie has endorsed many of the ideas that Barack Obama supports, whether it is Common Core or gun control or the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor or the donation he made to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.620307658628	I'm the only one on this stage that has a plan that would create jobs, cut taxes, balance the budget and can get it done because I'm realistic.
0.0	0.252273035887	Illegal immigration is beyond belief.
0.0	0.320913963091	Hey look, he never had a chance.
0.0	0.648738087003	You just see the recent deal announced today or yesterday, more spending, more tax increasing, more regulation.
0.0	0.602737810863	And you put me on that stage against her next September, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.725552440784	We had Iran putting operatives in South America and Central America.
0.0	0.258220819473	But bottom line is: The president is right.
0.0	0.209307428435	You gotta be creative and imaginative.
0.0	0.629956490918	Half of American seniors would be in poverty without a Social Security check.
0.0	0.371118835095	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.666553735911	Last I heard, a United States senator had the right to disagree with the president, including a president who has done such an extraordinary job.
0.0	0.242727142965	We can make a stronger program.
0.0	0.278424137682	Super PACs are a disaster.
0.0	0.297850764616	We're going to let people in, but they're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.80329627846	She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video.
0.0	0.523416700723	We can't afford another four years of that.
0.0	0.564988178569	And this deal is giving him a pathway to a bomb, a missile to deliver it, and money to pay for it all.
0.0	0.283599336302	Martha, religious liberty doesn't include encouraging a fellow American to engage in violent jihad and kill an American here.
0.0	0.223482799789	Thank you.
0.0	0.231091375907	But the facts and the law here are really quite clear.
0.0	0.236144502888	Check it out.
0.0	0.273835652116	The natural next question is who actually has done so.
0.0	0.402369983609	... president of the United States has got to do, and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility, is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe.
0.0	0.687648606857	And, then we have to go after sentencing, and that's one of the problems here in Wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn't happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level.
0.0	0.40921893631	I'm going to do what it takes to defend this nation.
0.0	0.524529272026	I have created tens of thousands of jobs, and I'll be creating many millions of jobs if I'm given -- if I'm given the opportunity to be president.
0.0	0.665836489651	Well, as you know, I'm a former elected prosecutor, a former elected attorney general, trained at the University of Virginia in constitutional law, and I don't believe in litmus tests except this.
0.0	0.427129060651	Simply expanding Medicaid does not improve health care outcomes.
0.0	0.259434218277	But it is a general economic issue.
0.0	0.5	Hillary Clinton lies about Benghazi, she lies about e- mails.
0.0	0.318911533258	I find -- I mean, it's just a very different, you know, historical perspective here.
0.0	0.513313379799	In my family, my dad fled oppression in Cuba to come to America.
0.0	0.563487244511	We have -- wait a second, we have $19 trillion in debt.
0.0	0.32264809794	But also where it's affordable, solar, wind in Iowa has become very affordable and it makes sense.
0.0	0.584126801847	Last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee.
0.0	0.491027403137	It's the people that pull the trigger and we have to find out what is going on.
0.0	0.519689153784	We hear all this discussion about well, I would do this, or I would do that, when the fact is, the border is still porous.
0.0	0.5	There's only a promise to pay by the next generation, and the next generation's not big enough to pay it.
0.0	0.713797040513	Americans are looking for somebody that's going to give them, and there is a place in this country over the last eight years in particular that talked about hope every day, and they didn't just talk about it, they delivered it.
0.0	0.397187760666	In Louisiana, instead we're helping people getting better paying jobs so they can provide for their own health care.
0.0	0.484565675343	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.262618183146	You know, let me say something at the outset.
0.0	0.239507433646	And here in Wisconsin, I want to reiterate: We've got to stand up for unions and working people who have done it before...
0.0	0.415944320608	And we have to cut off the flow of foreign funding and foreign fighters.
1.0	0.581944744676	And what that's led to over $2 trillion of American companies' monies that are being kept offshore, because they don't want to pay the second tax.
0.0	0.317064848707	And we would still have governors like Scott Walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions.
0.0	0.460304973784	So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.610106772873	When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York.
0.0	0.207876257077	Well, sure.
0.0	0.247658770678	So -- you know, you shouldn't misrepresent how well you're doing with the polls.
0.0	0.525273987606	I know that we are at greater risk today than at any time since then of another attack.
0.0	0.687525904786	It was 25 years ago, and I came by defeating the Democratic incumbent.
0.0	0.184613005963	And how do I know it?
0.0	0.588680028513	Now, I'm the only person that's put out a detailed plan on how to deal with entitlements.
0.0	0.223482799789	Appreciate it.
0.0	0.214947046583	But I -- the struggle of single moms is extraordinary.
0.0	0.28298604276	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.410274591815	Thanks for coming back to me, Maria.
0.0	0.38785605599	I used the tithing analogy.
0.0	0.397859431288	If somebody's already stolen money from you, are you going to give them more?
0.0	0.676592361835	Now in terms of their really stunning hit piece, what they mentioned is when I was running for senate -- unlike Hillary Clinton, I don't have masses of money in the bank, hundreds of millions of dollars.
0.0	0.308762679279	I'll tell you what else people are concerned about.
0.0	0.369948985329	It's the most exceptional country the world has ever known.
1.0	0.63463169496	He voted in favor of regime change with Libya, voted in favor of the Security Council being an active participate in setting the parameters for what we would do, which of course we followed through on.
0.0	0.773001930659	Marco stood today, standing on this stage Marco supports legalization and citizenship for 12 million illegals.
0.0	0.203222125755	Not trustworthy.
0.0	0.210723944829	Community has to understand that that police officer wants to get home at night, and not -- not to lose their life.
0.0	0.338938647781	Here's the bottom line, and I'll close with this.
0.0	0.225439312804	We know this for a fact.
0.0	0.426554970127	And I'm saying we have to get to the bottom of it.
0.0	0.284434029471	And I said, "Didn't you resent America for not letting you be with your father in those formative and very threatening years?"
0.0	0.790031882469	It's tax-free -- a huge advantage for our farmers and ranchers and manufacturers -- and every import pays the 16 percent business flat tax.
0.0	0.631818770359	That's the way it should be, and I'm going to continue to reach out to thank all my online contributors for everything they are doing for me, to encourage them and help me do more just as Senator Sanders is.
0.0	0.429096765764	The business flat tax, they already impose their taxes on us, so there's no reciprocal...
0.0	0.313912948101	Not my kind of guy.
0.0	0.463343854825	You know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in America.
0.0	0.238389790533	You also have to prove that you're going to pay these people more than you would pay someone else, so that you're not undercutting it by bringing in cheap labor.
0.0	0.468372193237	And Mexico's going to pay for the wall because Mexico -- I love the Mexican people; I respect the Mexican leaders -- but the leaders are much sharper, smarter and more cunning than our leaders.
0.0	0.280561322463	We're not going to dismantle everything.
0.0	0.67935618345	We need to get back to training people in this country to do the jobs of the 21st century.
0.0	0.259797857177	He doesn't understand the threat in ISIS.
0.0	0.641595609717	This debate needs to be about the men and women across this country that are struggling on a daily basis to provide for their families the better future that we've always said this country is all about.
0.0	0.278193327368	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.413423209218	And I make a lot more than the average American.
0.0	0.376886999298	We have to get the remaining 10.
0.0	0.223782794824	No.
0.0	0.335492557892	But the Democrats are going to bring a lawsuit, and you have to have certainty.
0.0	0.553613278515	and they decide, we're going to raise it to 30 percent, plus we're going to raise the income tax to 30 percent.
0.0	0.690271468409	... first of all, let me just tell you something -- and you know, because you just saw the numbers yourself -- NBC Wall Street Journal just came out with a poll -- headline: Trump way up, Cruz going down.
0.0	0.690478479387	They want a political revolution in which millions of Americans stand up, come together, not let the Trumps of the world divide us, and say, you know what, in this great country, we need a government that represents all of us, not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.
0.0	0.759187323502	His plan is a good plan, and I will note that my 10% plan also eliminates the payroll tax, eliminates the death tax,
0.0	0.480478924143	I've done it once in Washington, with great jobs and lower taxes.
0.0	0.455472490087	And Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will say it's those evil rich people.
0.0	0.346173274012	One of them being that if you don't have some agreement within the system from states and from families and from students, it's hard to get to where we need to go.
0.0	0.530780824767	I go further in the plan that I've proposed, which has been called the toughest, most effective, comprehensive plan for reining in the other risks that the financial system could face.
0.0	0.765377484473	A flat tax for everybody -- no exemptions, no deductions, no shelters, because some people have a better capability of taking advantage of those than others.
0.0	0.284934876645	You count on it.
0.0	0.180713174718	But realistically, even if they do, the money is flowing.
0.0	0.225894975558	Let me say on that...
0.0	0.724625810614	I've heard a lot of hot rhetoric here tonight, but I've got to tell you, as somebody that actually passed a budget; that paid down a half-a-trillion dollars of our national debt, you can't do it alone.
0.0	0.330486393945	I am all in favor of keeping these talented people here so they can go to work in Silicon Valley.
0.0	0.619994431555	You know, I sat down with the senior leadership of John Deere.
0.0	0.715990945358	Before this, I was a very successful person as a developer and as a businessman.
0.0	0.238309048341	It's their money.
0.0	0.239646765222	-- the governor's absolutely right.
0.0	0.435514446935	I was recruited to H.P.
0.0	0.590298916377	Effectively it is day trading without any regulation at all.
0.0	0.243979844596	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.670920281157	What we ought to do is tighten up our efforts to deal with the entry visa program so that a citizen from Europe, it's harder if they've been traveling to Syria or traveling to these other places where there is Islamic terrorism, make it harder -- make the screening take place.
0.0	0.294163025729	She was a great CEO.
0.0	0.424851017101	I'm tired of seeing what's going on, between the border where the people flow over; people come in; they live; they shoot.
0.0	0.521262644882	I changed it in New Jersey.
0.0	0.25545297218	Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point?
0.0	0.444303571219	Because what she will do is come in and she will raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.69032605401	Not too many years ago, Donald did a long interview with Tim Russert.
0.0	0.475348883303	Almost 60 percent of American people now need to hire an expert to understand their taxes.
0.0	0.238926123665	So you might not.
0.0	0.603784458837	Today a male African-American baby born today stands a one-in-four chance of ending up in jail.
0.0	0.460526452407	We're going to lose Social Security and Medicare if Republicans and Democrats do not come together and find a solution like Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.582440750019	We put in place child care support.
0.0	0.401251109384	Well, I wish you would have asked that question years ago when they broke it.
0.0	0.455794594679	You get, like, three days where you have to show up?
0.0	0.243743735764	Socialist and government dependent.
0.0	0.211103317005	China, they don't like to tell us but they have total control -- just about, of North Korea.

0.0	0.626699911003	The other Arab countries have a role to play in this.
0.0	0.437204988282	We've got to stop this culture of government dependence.
0.0	0.469527070962	You know, as I said already twice in this debate, we have a very serious problem in this country.

0.0	0.403790090315	I think he has addressed a lot of these issues that have been quite difficult, but he has gone forward.
0.0	0.261337099773	And, for those of us who are serious enough to run for president, think long and hard why we're here, and hopefully you'll know we're not here for ourselves.

0.0	0.665927363593	Senator Sanders voted against it at that time.
1.0	0.435400653846	It looked like very few women.
0.0	0.456971786927	You know, after 9/11, one of the efforts that we did in New York was if you see something or hear something suspicious, report it.
0.0	0.193468721609	And we will be strong again.
0.0	0.184220844349	That is absolutely inaccurate.
0.0	0.66335348239	King Abdullah of Jordan, a man I've known for a long time, has been asking for bombs and materiel.
0.0	0.399549715884	You didn't see these kind of ideas being batted around, and being batted around in a way that's civil and smart and that's trying to help to inform the voter out there.
0.0	0.359392095023	The age will have to gradually rise, there is no question.
0.0	0.833544463392	I was the chairman of the National Commission on Homeland Security and Terrorism for the United States for five years.
0.0	0.237602033473	But let me just say that we also need down -- to tear down the cyber walls that China is erecting, that Russia is erecting.
0.0	0.798351509609	I've said I'm looking at a couple of different ways, one which you mentioned, Senator, but also trying to expand the existing tax to passive income that wealthy people have so that we do get more revenue into the Social Security Trust Fund.
0.0	0.234356562721	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.284474482474	You can call it visas, you can call it work permits, you can call it anything you want.
0.0	0.23612942723	They expect to have it.

0.0	0.505170100098	It was a back sacrifice, and I have to hand it to Ben.

0.0	0.299087762394	Credibility counts.
0.0	0.734576252977	We have a budget closer to $3.5 trillion.
0.0	0.334230993985	I guess just for the fun of it; they want to throw money around.
0.0	0.463150806078	We got to do a lot about the high cost of high -- higher education, but we've got to make sure we're training people for jobs that exist, that are good jobs that can pay.
0.0	0.475228756176	I would say the message that got us the win in Iowa and 10 other states against pretty overwhelming odds, is the message that's going to deliver us in this election.
1.0	0.418220751876	Well, there's not question that we should be able to look at past president whether they're married to somebody who's running for president or not in terms of their past behavior and what it means.
0.0	0.285082419296	Like rich kids, they deserve to get a free education.
0.0	0.343329654996	So let's start by knowing where your money is being spent by the federal government.
0.0	0.223482799789	Thank you.
0.0	0.386640169289	The fact is, there's a number of things that the next president is going to have to do to clean up this mess.
0.0	0.187914114529	...eliminates the business...
0.0	0.732996002998	I had to answer every single question about every single result and every single projection in public until there were no more questions.
0.0	0.303742668937	And if you become the nominee, who the hell knows if you can even serve in office?
0.0	0.75159449962	The reality is four times as many blacks get arrested for marijuana.
0.0	0.555497779509	There is no money in the Social Security account.
0.0	0.211313762742	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.516051434929	Absolutely, because what we will do is say, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so they're not hanging out on street corners.
0.0	0.393911918264	Well, this is going to be a show me, don't tell me election.
0.0	0.428885870645	And for the sake of me, I can't figure out which one is which.
0.0	0.603296114559	Mine gives every American a simple, flat tax of 10 percent.
0.0	0.244080302781	Here's the bottom line.
0.0	0.743200745795	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.42895285441	The first one would be to my good friend, Bibi Netanyahu, to reassure him we will stand with the State of Israel.
0.0	0.783693071515	When I was running for senate just about every lobbyist, just about all of the establishment opposed me in the senate race in Texas and my opponent in that race was worth over 200 million dollars.
0.0	0.70242646211	That's why we embraced free enterprise, and it made us the most prosperous people in the history of the world.
0.0	0.232947470538	...numerically, it's gonna be higher.
0.0	0.652485392804	I was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came.
0.0	0.316085916933	You know why three?
0.0	0.195597103578	So look, corporations ought to exercise some responsibility.
0.0	0.559920678485	And this president, given what Ted said right at the beginning, he's absolutely right.
0.0	0.651722844258	The fact of the matter is we the American people are not each other's enemies, it's those people who are trying to divide us who are the enemies.
0.0	0.564695371544	Doesn't hurt rich people if their bar of soap goes up ten cents, but it hurts the poor and the middle class.
0.0	0.72587637477	And at the end of the day, it was the president's decision.
0.0	0.201517980016	You don't want to hear the answer.
0.0	0.357726156841	He is not the only one.
0.0	0.255588480537	I am a conservative; I can win this job, I can do this job, I need your help, I need your support.
1.0	0.690255018377	A vat is imposed as a sales tax when you buy a good.
0.0	0.436526551066	But you know what, you can make a middle class wage, you have decent health care, decent benefits.
0.0	0.538240193575	You can -- if you -- you flew in with your 767, didn't you?
0.0	0.131845660559	But the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, it's to understand what happens the day after.
0.0	0.446653048525	The fact that it's happened for so many people here throughout our history, that's what makes us special.
0.0	0.288266306932	I agree with my colleagues.
0.0	0.514808142346	Look, I am deeply concerned about what's happening in every community in America, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths.
0.0	0.77472489496	The New York Times a few weeks back had a columnist who wrote a column saying, "Anybody But Cruz."
0.0	0.227444755301	Illegal.
0.0	0.203586069624	What else we can do is that we should believe in science.
0.0	0.402948331247	We need a president that doesn't just talk a game, but a president that's got real results.
0.0	0.179538253754	...and be held accountable.
0.0	0.2655962201	Not -- not on that, no.
0.0	0.224288519058	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.560412850745	But I want to start by helping those people who are most at risk, the ones who, yes, are cutting their pills in half, who don't believe they can make the rent, who are worried about what comes next for them.
0.0	0.355642541485	And I'm glad that I have a chance to answer this question.
0.0	0.561656641638	Low income people who are not involved in the political process.
0.0	0.373611549708	So I'm going to keep making that case.
0.0	0.249862545778	If we don't stop them over there, they are coming here just as sure as I stand here in front of you.
0.0	0.303238329456	And we don't need a weak person being president of the United State, OK?
0.0	0.241638901695	White people?
0.0	0.197490013906	But I would add this.
0.0	0.160771689658	So, I think gun-free zones are a catastrophe.
1.0	0.758934284111	You know, I left my medical practice and ran for office because I was concerned about an $18 trillion debt.
0.0	0.252806657177	And secondly, we should pass the legislation that I've introduced...
0.0	0.698801927615	And therefore, they don't get the income tax break, but their prices are going to be higher, because the vat tax is embedded in both the prices that business that are charging and in the wages they pay their employees.
0.0	0.18577039786	I don't think anybody should expand Medicaid.
0.0	0.549547742353	Because Obama and Clinton policies, the United States is moving further and further into a decline.
0.0	0.155274224639	Because if you are, you need to elect someone who's deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.189905276863	Fiscal discipline, know what you're doing.
0.0	0.355191686199	He got lucky with fracking.
0.0	0.628932061689	And that's the way my parents came legally in 1956.
0.0	0.392470877138	I didn't find it offensive at all.
0.0	0.282331164604	Let me just close it out this way.
0.0	0.190809280099	We don't need to add new rules, we need to make sure the FBI does its job.
0.0	0.355461502043	Their kids come out of college, they have high debt and they can't get a good job.
0.0	0.362771270499	We have people out of work.
0.0	0.538184015857	I would begin by saying that I'm not sure it's a weakness, but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for America's future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people.
0.0	0.706157729549	The truth is I had to make some tough calls in some tough times.
0.0	0.290398508229	And if I were the prosecutor, that is exactly where they would be.
0.0	0.703211635879	You know, in recent travels around this country, I've encountered so many Americans who are discouraged and angry as they watch our freedom, our security and the American dream slipping away under an unresponsive government that is populated by bureaucrats and special interest groups.
0.0	0.768240188872	John, listen, let's keep in mind that for one-third of the 60 million Americans on Social Security it represents 90 percent of their income.
0.0	0.480140569607	We're going to take the political handcuffs off the military.
0.0	0.715960679635	I stood yesterday with 75 construction workers.
0.0	0.39600837432	But let me say one more thing.
0.0	0.760856066404	Or we're going to ship 10 million Americans -- or 10 million people out of this country, leaving their children here in this country and dividing families?
0.0	0.09732604283	But I like to be unpredictable so that people don't know exactly... (LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.650096029365	You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president...
0.0	0.353862961504	I never said that.
0.0	0.477413865413	...you wrote a story on it, and you had to go back and correct it.
0.0	0.369952910978	I mean, she would drive a car until it wouldn't make a sound, and then gather up all her coins and buy a new car.
0.0	0.650106569908	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government in setting up -- retirement plans.
0.0	0.445642652943	Have you ever disagreed with a president?
0.0	0.701691228844	As a matter of fact, if you're Hispanic or African-American in Texas, you have the number one high school graduation rates in America.
0.0	0.331736478759	And, that's why tonight I'm asking you for your vote.
0.0	0.493284078453	And the idea that this negotiation -- I will tell you one thing.
0.0	0.335155913341	I saw them come down.
0.0	0.288145371905	What you need to do is free up interest rates.
0.0	0.226461091362	You can't do nothing.
0.0	0.507050351477	We're going to do a tax cut for all Americans.
0.0	0.688990827283	And now in Ohio, with the same formula, wages higher than the -- than the national average.
0.0	0.649868867702	I saw you on the Senate floor flip your vote on crop insurance because they told you it would help you in Iowa, and last week, we all saw you flip your vote on ethanol in Iowa for the same reason.
0.0	0.257392421942	What you need to do is free up interest rates.
0.0	0.241166417682	Right.
0.0	0.220813823097	And in fact I would go further.
0.0	0.840982855092	And the entire New York times attack -- is that I disclosed that loan on one filing with the United States Senate, that was a public filing.
0.0	0.671014213118	We're going to combine all commercial activity in business into one place in the tax code and charge it 15 percent, which is going to suddenly make us competitive with the rest of the world.
0.0	0.486403621088	I had to borrow money to go to school.
0.0	0.458890961691	And, you know, for six-and-a-half years, we've had a gigantic party.
0.0	0.226870077368	I win.
0.0	0.528973915077	I'm not running against Governor Bush, I'm not running against anyone on this stage.
0.0	0.4295654237	And I would not stand for that as president of the United States.
0.0	0.542722359394	I don't think you expand entitlements when so many people are dependent on government and when the money the federal government is offering is going to be taken away from you after just a couple of years.
0.0	0.35977586825	I've seen plenty of other people follow up?
0.0	0.542719100823	But the average person takes out about $350,000.
0.0	0.408642804739	This is one of the areas I've disagreed with Senator Sanders on, who has called for Iranian troops trying to end civil war in Syria, which I think would be a grave mistake.
0.0	0.250202060667	But here's the best solution of all.
0.0	0.573799191763	I think to be commander in chief in the 21st century requires someone who understands how the economy works, someone who understands how the world works and who's in it; I know more world leaders on the stage today than anyone running, with the possible exception of Hillary Clinton; understands bureaucracies, how to cut them down to size and hold them accountable; and understands technology, which is a tool, but it's also a weapon that's being used against us.
0.0	0.769831837202	The fact is that this Justice Department under this president has been a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.250937820292	John?
0.0	0.238770238288	That's what they're doing.
0.0	0.394682282077	Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, they're no better.
0.0	0.346089794687	It's the evil government that is -- that is putting all these regulations on us so that we can't survive.
0.0	0.387738659505	Donald, Donald -- can I -- I hope you reconsider this, because this policy is a policy that makes it impossible to build the coalition necessary to take out ISIS.
0.0	0.258402385611	And the last piece is this.
0.0	0.258094454048	We need to incent private savings and make sure that Social Security is protected for those that have it.
0.0	0.785021468461	It was the first time we did it since man walked on the moon.
0.0	0.5	That is very different than talking about specific action for regime change, which I did not support.
0.0	0.648844286992	Under my plan, no business, big or small, will pay more than 25 percent flat rate on their business income.
0.0	0.612801122086	And it was with us for months, the smell, the air.
0.0	0.5	I would not place one American life at risk unless it was absolutely necessary.
0.0	0.191635543145	Someone who's going to stand up, and be very clear with our enemies as to the lines their going to draw and stand with them.
0.0	0.556323718199	He is -- this president is undermining the constitutional basis of this government.
0.0	0.578339512245	We are at 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.357225341215	When you look at raising the debt limit, it should be leverage to try to reform government.
0.0	0.317310295715	And I do carry on occasion, sometimes a lot.
0.0	0.279285252027	Because now he's going a little bit better.
0.0	0.255710162542	So let's set the facts straight.
0.0	0.577608790567	But, by the way, when it comes to a woman having to make a very personal choice, ah, in that case, my Republican colleagues love the government and want the government to make that choice for every woman in America.
0.0	0.372482243049	The Egyptians have asked us to share intelligence.
0.0	0.35754358435	Lawrence Tribe and (inaudible) from Harvard -- of Harvard, said that there is a serious question as to whether or not Ted can do this.
0.0	0.427809630207	We could overthrow Assad tomorrow if we wanted to.
0.0	0.32959751898	We have a country of borders.
0.0	0.5	I agree, however, it doesn't go far enough, because what it focuses on are the big banks, which Senator Sanders has talked about a lot, for good reason.
0.0	0.485567106177	... put us on firm ground, and has sent us into the future.
0.0	0.191749436889	And sending that signal makes it impossible for us to be serious about taking out ISIS and restoring democracy in Syria.
0.0	0.196128049564	I would just say that...
0.0	0.452565360717	If we reengage and get involved, yeah, we can have health care for all people, we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.376941123138	If these are the kinds of people -- we should use our best and our finest.
0.0	0.268658816046	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.701917568693	I don't think the founders put the Second Amendment as number two by accident.
0.0	0.446248994772	That is the fight we have to have, and we have to undo a whole set of things that President Obama has done that get at the heart of his disrespect and disregard for too many Americans.
1.0	0.253580611137	That's exactly what the Republican establishment says too.
1.0	0.253575267432	Very few children.
0.0	0.285460979655	No vision at all.
0.0	0.588015376807	We don't have a health care crisis in America, we have a health crisis.
0.0	0.308979958227	Senator Cruz is precisely right.
0.0	0.342370860471	Well, I'm very happy to get a question this early on.
0.0	0.30290397094	I said no.
0.0	0.314832108588	Our best days are in front of us.
0.0	0.448581292471	He is the party's frontrunner right now, and good for him.
0.0	0.687762636935	Well, that has not been a part of most of the proposals that I've seen.
0.0	0.144377801627	QUICK: Governor, thank you.
1.0	0.69569333535	We owe $19 trillion, boy am I good at solving debt problems.
0.0	0.759661151079	The rate -- the rate -- the rate is gonna be much closer to 15 percent.
0.0	0.147622837004	I do not think we should promise or even look toward normalizing relations because we have a lot of other business to get done with Iran.
0.0	0.392315886498	So this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle.
0.0	0.660560792736	We're going to bring jobs back from Japan, we're going to bring jobs back from China, we're going to bring, frankly, jobs back from Mexico where, as you probably saw, Nabisco is leaving Chicago with one of their biggest plants, and they're moving it to Mexico.
0.0	0.479061905464	They're looking -- they're recruiting people that enter this country as doctors and engineers and even fiances.
0.0	0.71267687573	So, yes, I do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white Americans -- particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have -- you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is.
0.0	0.517381319108	Our waste water plants, our rail, our airports, in many places are disintegrating.
0.0	0.314452521112	The time to turn the page is now.
0.0	0.382917597159	And when America does not lead, the world is a dangerous and a tragic place.
1.0	0.819988415354	Six million more people living in poverty than the day that Barack Obama got elected president, and the left just wants more of the same.
0.0	0.161894501868	I mean, you know...

0.0	0.297724102403	That's who's in my mind

0.0	0.315382103039	How do we decide on who gets to follow up?
0.0	0.717426307927	Well, first off, let's face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
1.0	0.895115583593	1.5 million jobs created during the worst economic time this country has had since the Great Depression while the rest of the country lost 400,000 jobs.
0.0	0.610057590984	As a result of his efforts and the efforts of Joe Biden against unprecedented, I was there in the Senate, unprecedented Republican obstructionism, we have made enormous progress.
0.0	0.419824677793	... on the issue -- on the issue of citizenship, Donald...
0.0	0.304830550477	They go to Yale.
0.0	0.309082334066	The fact is in New Jersey, what we have done is to make it easier now to get a conceal and carry permit.
0.0	0.425190838811	It is hard to find someone in my generation that thinks Social Security will be there for us.
0.0	0.406819867997	This is the unholy alliance that people need to know about between right and left.
0.0	0.185271915503	And here's the last piece...
0.0	0.479097509028	I look at Washington, and I hear the talk, and I see the promises and it seems nothing ever changes.
0.0	0.36624019691	Yes, they've got to get out of Syria.
0.0	0.295437796047	So we have work to do.
0.0	0.378204834326	Number two, this isn't me saying it.
0.0	0.448339944363	The first thing is we have to strengthen our alliances around the world.
0.0	0.458509872116	Here's the thing that I would ask Donald Trump in all seriousness.
0.0	0.200114300677	We need Jordan.
0.0	0.745944560587	I did it as the chairman of the Budget Committee, working with Senator Domenici.
0.0	0.210949851974	They're protectionist.
0.0	0.897493629506	As a result, eight credit upgrades; as a result, a top ten state for private sector job creation.
0.0	0.424174564964	Because the damage he has done to America is extraordinary.
0.0	0.616621268896	When millions of Americans rose up against Obamacare, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.212655501657	We don't win.
0.0	0.493832841039	And based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don't add up, and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now.
0.0	0.29036736066	This is about people's lives, and we should level with the American people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare.
0.0	0.442659480655	I am not a single- issue candidate, and I do not believe we live in a single-issue country.
0.0	0.546456380106	And so everybody needs to discount some of the things you're going to hear in these ads, and discount the -- the back-and-forth here, because every person here is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.740152966801	We don't represent Wall Street, we don't represent the billionaire class, so it ends up I'm the only candidate up here of the many candidates who has no Super PAC.
0.0	0.613991283061	Ohio, one of the best growing places in the country -- I not only did it in Washington, I did it in Ohio, and I'll go back to Washington, and there will be no more silly deals...
0.0	0.398269058744	He has got -- that is why he is on the end.
0.0	0.313639301052	I didn't.
0.0	0.251828529794	His first election and his re-election.
0.0	0.350810445289	So look, in foreign policy -- in foreign policy, it's strength, but you've got to be cool.
0.0	0.142323472777	And we need to very, very concerned about that.
0.0	0.697934819934	This is a group of people that enslaves women and sells them, sells them as brides.
0.0	0.244637416393	Are you serious about this election?
0.0	0.417320102448	We're seeing it in my state and we'll see it in this country.
0.0	0.265029917682	And, where we are failing abysmally is in the very high rate of recidivism we see.
0.0	0.187432418451	So yeah, someone who makes more money...
0.0	0.300299756048	We would still have racism holding people back.
0.0	0.720861438223	If you're worried about the world being on fire, you're worried about how we're going to use our military, you're worried about strengthening our military and you're worried most of all about keeping your homes and your families safe and secure, you cannot give Hillary Clinton a third term of Barack Obama's leadership.
0.0	0.43764135784	Those of you health savings accounts.
0.0	0.26465305189	Next, we have to talk to our adversaries, and we have to make sure they understand the limits of our patience.
0.0	0.158486427553	We need to make sure that we keep the country safe.
0.0	0.656977488903	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.365755447014	And, yes, people we may disagree with on a number of things may have some insight, may have some relationships that are important for the president to understand in order to best protect the United States.
0.0	0.351032228369	But I recall when Secretary Clinton ran against then-Senator Obama, she was critical of him for suggesting that maybe you want to talk to Iran, that you want to talk to our enemies.
0.0	0.375632801212	This issue is not about that anymore.
0.0	0.178656365884	I want to be in -- I want America to be the best...
0.0	0.281568219723	And here's what the economic issue is.
0.0	0.392376258252	I'm wearing a Trump tie tonight.
0.0	0.489005094952	He pays on his personal rate, and he is paying higher than the big dry-cleaning chain down the street, because he's paying at his personal rate.
0.0	0.507607525432	Every war you can imaging, we have people at each other's throat and our strength is actually in our unity.
0.0	0.632617632102	So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives.
0.0	0.352078189419	Hillary Clinton cannot be president.
0.0	0.240916660515	It's not my PAC.
0.0	0.644544676193	... that suspends all refugees from nations that ISIS or Al Qaida controls significant territory.
0.0	0.348931615157	He wasn't my senator.
0.0	0.513115259705	Conservatives, I am a conservative because I believe no one of us is any better than any other one of us.
0.0	0.244814561629	And, you know, there are a number of programs that I think are duplicative and redundant and not producing the results that people deserve.
0.0	0.163448046863	Well, Senator, look, I think we're in vigorous agreement here.
0.0	0.145438842283	And, we come out here, and we do our thing.
0.0	0.414738184802	Look, in addition to what Donald was saying is we also need to talk about the legal immigration system for permanent residents.
0.0	0.210625556501	The answer is simple.
0.0	0.175832501931	Well, obviously, you don't understand my views on homosexuality.
0.0	0.482929651495	It will lead to even greater war in this world.
0.0	0.256951369907	Let me start -- I want to get to the substance of the question on jobs, but I want to start with something.
0.0	0.469228985959	I have been a strong ally with him on virtually every issue.
0.0	0.383840986556	We can get back in the game to restore order and security for our own country.
0.0	0.488211882395	And I have a road map and a plan right now to get us to balance.
0.0	0.624656745332	I congratulate Secretary of State John Kerry and the president for working on this agreement.
0.0	0.234440008758	I'm prepared.
0.0	0.333581945441	He doesn't want to get people together, the old-fashioned way, where you get Congress.
0.0	0.243650095	Here's my second problem.
0.0	0.231089068154	Do we still have values and principles?
0.0	0.145043017738	Well, you're talking about -- yeah.
0.0	0.720574621422	You had only 21 Republican governors in this country.
0.0	0.550404300655	What we should do is to be investing in all types of energy, John, all types of energy.
0.0	0.36580818547	Since I was attacked too.
0.0	0.412637599834	But on this point, if I may add something on this point.
0.0	0.398328754912	You can't deal in China without tariffs.
0.0	0.623179034627	If she gets elected, her first 100 days, instead of setting an agenda, she might be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse.
0.0	0.617794076726	Any connection to the fact that not one Republican candidate for president thinks and agrees with the scientific community that climate change is real and that we have got to transform our energy system?
0.0	0.197674823446	...Then I'll buy you a tequila...
0.0	0.250937820292	John.
0.0	0.208144045133	There's something going on and it's bad.
0.0	0.311539340957	No, it speaks to the fact that I don't know those --
0.0	0.178216975339	But, here is the truth.
0.0	0.253624337756	You can't just ban all Muslims.
0.0	0.474195207021	Every election we talk about Medicare and Social Security reform.
0.0	0.218574632946	He's wrong.
0.0	0.289174842927	The Europeans have moved on.
0.0	0.30975855775	We cannot be the world's policeman.
0.0	0.298717682671	But the final thing I want to say about this is the following.
0.0	0.797772038183	Two of them were among the most highly decorated -- they weren't allowed on a military base to have guns.
0.0	0.522656303612	I would sign an executive order protecting religious liberty, our first amendment rights, so Christian business owners and individuals don't face discrimination for having a traditional view of marriage.
0.0	0.193369441843	It could be people that are going to do great, great destruction.
0.0	0.266215898909	in particular.
0.0	0.678275503665	Secretary of state for four years.
0.0	0.228946865409	You know, I -- my -- my mother taught me this.
0.0	0.413915616691	It will cause the economy to grow, to explode, to create more jobs.
0.0	0.276097728008	They explode the bomb, we have an electromagnetic pulse.
0.0	0.449845511907	There are ways to retrain the 50 and 51-year-olds, because they've got great value.
0.0	0.227269005248	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.175498138109	No, it's true.
0.0	0.214479957117	We need a doer, not a talker.
0.0	0.676428722495	Lots of people will say lots of different things about me in this campaign and others, but the one thing they've never said about me is that I'm misunderstood.
0.0	0.464662061412	And I will have done it within 100 days, and it will pass.
0.0	0.471157398879	Reforms, everything from moral and cultural issues to economic issues.
0.0	0.39138856402	You will begin to see jobs created in a robust economy.
0.0	0.540040464067	They're making a half, two-thirds what they used to make.
0.0	0.218447618826	We need to embed with -- with the Iraqi military.
0.0	0.375609405489	So we have a good group of people.
1.0	0.314703723388	Strong, powerful men, young and people are looking at that and they're saying what's going on?
0.0	0.379210786496	When you head back to airport tonight, go check and see what the...
0.0	0.552147912433	And specifically, we know that we could have detected and repelled some of these cyber attacks if that collaboration had been permitted.
0.0	0.645690260003	We should reimpose sanctions, they've already violated sanctions after this agreement was signed by testing medium-range missiles.
0.0	0.669438644797	They told you that your Social Security money is in a trust fund.
0.0	0.258657074738	Most importantly, I think I understand leadership, which sometimes requires a tough call in a tough time.
0.0	0.533885836301	So I believe that working with Europe -- and, by the way, you know, we've got some very wealthy countries there in that part of the world.
0.0	0.369044498323	She is still defending Planned Parenthood, and she is still her party's frontrunner.
0.0	0.741615635635	Today, many of us picked up our newspapers, and we were horrified to see the sight of 10 American sailors on their knees, with their hands on their heads.
0.0	0.481960052706	But those kinds of personal assessments and charges are ones that I find particularly troubling.
0.0	0.327413481107	But the voters are savvier than that.
0.0	0.808963165571	And I would note the Senate just a few weeks ago voted to suspend refugees from Middle Eastern countries.
0.0	0.217939462285	I totally get that.
0.0	0.223782794824	No.
0.0	0.54292623222	Here's what I would do Neil, I would appoint an Attorney General and I would have one very brief conversation with that Attorney General.
0.0	0.422777227816	The only way to figure that out is to go back to getting the intelligence community the funding and the tools that it needs to be able to keep America safe.
0.0	0.40995851867	According to the FBI and the director of national intelligence, Syria's becoming a perfect platform to strike our nation.
0.0	0.742697595587	Over the last few weeks, I've listened to Jeb as he walked around the country and said that you're modeling your campaign after John McCain, that you're going to launch a furious comeback the way he did, by fighting hard in New Hampshire and places like that, carrying your own bag at the airport.
0.0	0.343237008932	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.665110547669	So as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and the like.
0.0	0.527988484936	I've got five grandkids.
0.0	0.589795019805	I don't know if any of us could have done what they did, one after another, within 48 hours of that tragedy taking place.
0.0	0.159833009525	I think maybe my greatest weakness is that I trust people too much.
0.0	0.297769322513	It isn't law-abiding gun owners.
0.0	0.563703196629	Their kids are having a hard time finding any work at all.
0.0	0.285276840154	Now we're having smaller families.
0.0	0.480950777176	And when you have insider information, which apparently has been the case, where people use that information and use big data to try to take advantage of it, there has to be some regulation.
0.0	0.227174732957	They do whatever what they do, OK.
0.0	0.481711255927	You know, I have said -- I have said many times, you know, I'm not asking people to support me because I'm a woman.
0.0	0.532436810347	If you saw that blimp that got cut loose from Maryland today, it's a perfect example of government.
0.0	0.465806885303	They should be running all the time, then they won't have time to plan attacks against us.
1.0	0.266739811182	Median wages have stagnated.
0.0	0.262493173115	We're going to create a border.
0.0	0.229408021404	I get to respond, right?
0.0	0.37170172467	Well, the deal was done.
0.0	0.331597452506	...in the world for people...
0.0	0.621923739782	He was kind of a conservative guy in many respects.
0.0	0.655759839675	It's a -- it's absolutely disgraceful that Secretary Kerry and others said in their response to what's going on in Iran that this was a good thing; it showed how the relationship was getting better.
0.0	0.538767710942	Well, I'll tell you something: you can take everything from the top 1 percent, and you apply it to our fiscal gap, and you won't even make a dent in it.
0.0	0.237870935276	Yes.
0.0	0.317957562166	We'll go to the Congress.
0.0	0.223482799789	Thank you.
0.0	0.471668866481	Everyone up here tonight that's talking about reforms, I think and I know for myself I speak to this, we're all talking about reforms for future generations.
0.0	0.348212252892	And we're letting them get away with it and we can't let them get away with it.
0.0	0.655537499589	Why in God's name does Wall Street make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.636348505993	I particularly appreciate the proposal that Congressman Jim Clyburn has -- the 10-20-30 proposal -- to try to spend more federal dollars in communities with persistent generational poverty.
0.0	0.513657987177	We need somebody ready to be commander-in-chief on day one, who understands there are no moderates in Iran, they've been killed a long time ago.
0.0	0.224878862846	It is.
0.0	0.551031123858	I will change the culture in Washington, just as I changed the culture in Tallahassee.
0.0	0.479610741984	What we are talking about in reality is a corrupt campaign finance system, that's what we're talking about.
0.0	0.214559459096	John, I'd like to address this?
0.0	0.293150150025	It is Hillary, it is Biden, it is the others who insist on allowing abortion well into viable (inaudible) wrong, and that should be stopped.
0.0	0.71433359727	And if you make $40,000 a year, a family of four, you don't pay any income tax at all.
0.0	0.182905486164	We will renew America if we work together, and I am totally confident that we will.
0.0	0.641788632282	They are radicalizing people in the United States, they are conducting attacks around the world.
0.0	0.195010338174	But, you know what we're not telling them?
0.0	0.227525331851	It works very, very well.
0.0	0.652274774731	I agree with President Obama who used executive orders to protect families because the Congress, the House was unable or refused to act.
0.0	0.808584548588	And there are 48 million people involved -- 40 million, 65 and over, and 8 million other.
0.0	0.367295464443	And what I think all of us are saying is, our monetary policy, our tax policy, regulatory policy needs to be radically changed so we can create high sustained growth for income to rise.
0.0	0.258106487368	You get the Senate.
0.0	0.138959025331	I think it's -- yeah, I think it's a one-two punch.
0.0	0.337518843159	Yeah, he said everybody.
0.0	0.630546446291	But, what we did is we said to the working families of this country, look, we know things are tough, but if you want to help us go beyond establishment politics, and establishment economics, send us something.
0.0	0.2123609336	...
0.0	0.592722492958	Which is what we're gonna get if we elect a big government liberal like Hillary Clinton to the White House.
0.0	0.624667834685	The agreement on a cease-fire, though, is something that has to be implemented more quickly than the schedule that the Russians agreed to.
0.0	0.424954637493	And we are going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fall.
0.0	0.297213549625	You looking at me?
0.0	0.51511223071	And we will join the rest of the other -- the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families.
0.0	0.383344301232	They said they would get rid of the unconstitutional amnesty.
0.0	0.422811193373	OK. You know, the Democrats who have the ultimate super PAC, it's called the mainstream media.
0.0	0.537645966013	And that's why this study, which shows that if you can believe it today, for white working class people between 45 and 54, life expectancy is actually going down.
0.0	0.163199671014	I love the Chinese people but they laugh themselves, they can't believe how stupid the American leadership is.
0.0	0.57818025281	And I'm going to tell you this, we need to use the benefit of our law enforcement people across this country, combined with our intelligence people across this country.
0.0	0.628055367456	Well Maria, thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the New York Times.
0.0	0.639863508069	And, look, I think it's important to look at what the most important counterterrorism judgment of the first four years of the Obama administration was, and that was the very difficult decision as to whether or not to advise the president to go after bin Laden.
0.0	0.637242619394	I can't speak for the Koch Brothers, you're referring to a Super PAC that we don't coordinate with, that was set up to support President Obama, that has now decided that they want to support me.
0.0	0.415086306626	This campaign is not just about electing a president.
0.0	0.297131749725	That's exactly what we saw.
0.0	0.19384731756	I can tell you, there wouldn't have been much damage.
0.0	0.550941742674	...The other thing I'd like to make about our plan, one more point, it is the most pro growth tax plan that I can imagine because it doesn't tax investments at all.
0.0	0.258276269668	No one is a socialist.
0.0	0.223482799789	Thank you.
0.0	0.244376828199	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.252443388422	And you can go get it at jeb2016.com.
1.0	0.6389553192	When I look at the migration, I looked at the line, I said it actually on your show recently, where are the women?
0.0	0.189579518229	...John...
0.0	0.244121595238	Well, that's a real question.
0.0	0.236678190508	It is not a suggestion.
0.0	0.667082591771	And that's how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America.
0.0	0.217812774803	Wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
1.0	0.286790820629	This president is undermining our military.
0.0	0.52558439269	Every time we send signals like this, we send a signal of weakness, not strength.
0.0	0.577984610065	If you're running for president of the United States and you do not understand that we cannot defend this nation without more of our soldiers over there, you are not ready for this job.
0.0	0.242279816894	Liberty thrives when government is small.
0.0	0.352682980926	Caesar's -- excuse me -- Caesar's, the Rolls-Royce, as you know, is in bankruptcy.
0.0	0.199969495078	I love China.
0.0	0.784927098225	Well, first of all, this is an issue that's been debated now for 30 years.
0.0	0.178161808345	So I would -- I would be willing to do that.
0.0	0.548380119828	Let me just say on taxes, how long have we been talking about tax reform in Washington, D.C.?
0.0	0.586904682532	But this is what you're seeing in the Republican debate that you didn't see in that Democrat debate.
0.0	0.245006842903	You can't have a question.
0.0	0.618611248367	Until we have a president of the United States that gets up every day and goes to the Oval Office with the intent purpose of securing that border, and there's not anybody on either one of these stages that has the experience of dealing with this as I have for over 14 years with that 1200-mile border.
0.0	0.702121281915	The Kurds have been asking us to arm them for three years.
0.0	0.167785969445	We need to know who our neighbors are.
0.0	0.228144297333	I do.
0.0	0.252479843277	That is beyond unspeakable.
0.0	0.234669502262	... and sign an agreement that makes sure that the world knows that they will have technological superiority.
0.0	0.223782794824	No.
0.0	0.348356425745	You have small businesses in America that are struggling.
0.0	0.272906511661	Now that he is, he's changed his tune.
0.0	0.307341071292	We're going to bring jobs and manufacturing back.
0.0	0.198256308922	I have no illusion.
0.0	0.730826984196	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.241506076936	It needs to be repealed and replaced.
0.0	0.198507152776	So, you know, we'll take our progress wherever we can find it.
0.0	0.670604410303	Well, I was pleased that NATO announced just this week that they're going to start doing patrols in the Mediterranean, in the Aegean, to try to interdict the smugglers, to try to prevent the kind of tragedies that we have seen all too often, also to try to prevent more refugees from coming to the European Union.
0.0	0.591025577283	Now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world.
0.0	0.435057818668	I strongly support the president's executive actions.
0.0	0.411052302413	And also, I've been tested in a way no one else has.
0.0	0.82723401307	One as a marine officer in Iraq, one as an army officer in Afghanistan.
0.0	0.227035644974	And wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong.
1.0	0.610162220713	You know, the FBI director, the president's appointed FBI director has said this week that because of a lack of support from politicians like the president of the United States, that police officers are afraid to get out of their cars; that they're afraid to enforce the law.
0.0	0.234031356227	You want me to answer that question?
0.0	0.232240591256	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.686244754788	It was never intended that the government should be in every aspect of our lives.
0.0	0.556042874931	The second thing I said is we need to add reforms, not just increase the numbers, but add reforms.
0.0	0.32010995935	You know, everyone here talks about the need to take on Washington.
0.0	0.91539780703	Kissinger was one of those people during the Vietnam era who talked about the domino theory.
0.0	0.394724530285	We can reform those entitlements, we can change that corporate tax code and lower it.
0.0	0.332054974174	I do not see -- want to see one parent or loved one worrying about getting a call in the middle of the night.
0.0	0.34228288863	Can you have Medicare or Social Security?
0.0	0.241166417682	Dynamically.
0.0	0.377024445789	People are waking up because it is going to be us who will determine the direction of our country.
0.0	0.242696661537	OK, good.
0.0	0.676241101513	He might not take my phone call, but he would get the message, and the message is this: Until you open every nuclear and every military facility to full, open, anytime/anywhere, for real, inspections, we are going to make it as difficult as possible for you to move money around the global financial system.
0.0	0.20540203527	I mean, I ask that with all due respect.
0.0	0.274338318143	We will win on everything we do.
0.0	0.379102995619	Crony capitalism is what happens when government gets so big and so powerful that only the big and the powerful can handle it.
0.0	0.634185732939	So you know, I had to report results every 90 days in excruciating detail.
0.0	0.307933464762	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.332084034333	Listen, in any Republican primary, everyone is going to say they support the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.725721944814	We called Ben, he was with me 100%.
0.0	0.192872613849	We need to create jobs.
0.0	0.177854139289	And it's especially significant that they are working with both Turkey and Greece in order to do this.
0.0	0.352348978635	What you saw was a parade of, "I'll give you this for free; I'll give you that for free."
0.0	0.531483867765	Here is the one thing I'm not going to do.
0.0	0.310651179786	Yes, I'm going to do away with that.
0.0	0.330756596089	First thing I'd tell the American people, whatever it takes to defend our nation, I would do.
0.0	0.865871958016	We have 30,000 fewer state bureaucrats than the day I took office.
0.0	0.557145236483	Ours was intended to be a citizen government.
0.0	0.211408597451	And what distributes goods better?
0.0	0.329865963424	And it's something that can be done, and I get questioned about that.
0.0	0.237870935276	Yes.
0.0	0.239110791841	When it comes to ISIS, we will not weaken them, we will not degrade them, we will utterly and completely destroy ISIS
0.0	0.837539037514	You're looking at the -- at the man who introduced and fought on the floor as a freshman senator and passed the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 over two President Clinton vetoes.
0.0	0.409222424763	You know, frankly, I did it in Washington, in Ohio, and I will do it again in Washington, if I'm president, to get this country moving again.
0.0	0.276976601108	Thirdly, we need to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to send a serious signal that we're back in the game with Israel --
0.0	0.257644079037	I'm worried about bankrupting the American people.
0.0	0.380868164372	But if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in Flint.
0.0	0.399321131944	We got rid of Gadhafi.
0.0	0.289304263276	We're going to get more revenue.
0.0	0.370100147154	Or, are you going to deal with the problem by saying, I'm going to give people who've done well in this country less benefit on the backend.
0.0	0.366789972535	You know, I have two sons.
0.0	0.339311127663	But the real -- but I think we have to get back to what this election has to be about.
0.0	0.599150643457	And I was going to tell you, whether I'm president or not, we better make it clear to the Saudis that we're going to support you, we're in relation with you just like we were in the first Gulf War, but you've got to knock off the funding and teaching of radical clerics who are the very people who try to destroy us and will turn around and destroy them.
0.0	0.510194125255	And yes, I was fired over a disagreement in the boardroom.
0.0	0.633868648075	I do believe that in the year 2016 we have to look in terms of public education as colleges as part of public education making public colleges and universities tuition free.
0.0	0.576478418801	This is a guy who just believes that law enforcement are the bad guys.
0.0	0.534026201016	A politician other than the people in the states -- I don't want to -- a politician cannot get them to pay.
0.0	0.393899596874	And the politicians always say it is so complicated, nobody but a politician can figure it out.
0.0	0.464977379649	Is there an area for a safety net?
0.0	0.511517971119	We're on the verge of being the first generation of Americans that leave our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.593682435735	Look, every time the Federal Government gets engaged in something it gets worse.
0.0	0.241166417682	Right.
0.0	0.535533170608	It's never been that way in American politics before.
0.0	0.348386159925	So I'm going to come up with the best way forward.
0.0	0.391255845294	I'd like to just mention something about my tax plan, and how it relates to the discussion...
0.0	0.466019015005	I'm not anti-Wall Street, but I don't believe the government ought to wear a team jersey, pick winners and losers.
0.0	0.202928612467	If you want someone who's not going to divide Washington, but gets things done, then you should make me your president.
0.0	0.397193127654	And then the Government steps in to try and solve the problem and we get a little further down to that progressive vision that Hillary Clinton is talking about.
1.0	0.61061641518	Someone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander in chief and someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi can never be president of the United States.
0.0	0.378569170149	We have got to destroy their training camps over there before they can attack us here.
0.0	0.250925656977	Growth is the answer.
0.0	0.313559803241	You know, I find it really quite fascinating some of the president's proclamations.
0.0	0.268849980905	Well, first of all, recognize it is a substantial problem.
0.0	0.223482799789	Thank you.
0.0	0.709974587713	And -- and I would note indeed, the reason I said that is I was asked -- my friend Donald has taken to it as (ph) advance playing Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the USA", and I was asked what I thought of that.
0.0	0.656977488903	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.421526850185	That's the end of the conversation.
0.0	0.229354474863	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.228698853699	I understand we can disagree on the path forward.
0.0	0.739674695857	This isn't just the country I was born in, this is the nation that literally changed the history of my family.
0.0	0.575578169115	Probably in terms of the applying for the job of president, a weakness would be not really seeing myself in that position until hundreds of thousands of people began to tell me that I needed to do it.
0.0	0.539115141564	I voted against the war in Iraq because I listened very carefully to what President Bush and Vice President Cheney had to say and I didn't believe them.
0.0	0.290517647584	It goes in the right direction.
0.0	0.598552009033	We have a president of the United States that is undermining this country's security and expanding the role of...
0.0	0.421612818784	I had to work my way through school.
0.0	0.778160292748	Let me just say, if you're talking about an $18 trillion economy, you're talking about a 15 percent tax on your gross domestic product.
0.0	0.5	So the answer is no and what Jeb said is absolutely correct.
0.0	0.730076781964	We took it away from the NSA, it was a bad decision by the president.
0.0	0.612958430643	And this is what we have to -- I -- I've got to tell you, when wages don't rise -- and they haven't for a lot of families for a number of years -- it's very, very difficult for them.
0.0	0.393394000147	He just writes out an order, executive order.
0.0	0.207783001232	And they say down as a group trying to make sure that we can begin to heal some of these problems that we see between community and police.
0.0	0.287605600409	They're concerned that Washington is so dysfunctional it is holding them back.
0.0	0.233541184962	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.207231484333	It's extraordinarily wrong.
0.0	0.168169635424	And I ask you to join me in truth and honesty and integrity.
0.0	0.241493668821	Our country doesn't win anymore.
0.0	0.712360895641	You know, you go to the internet, you start reading an article and you go to the comments section -- you cannot go five comments down before people are calling each all manner of names.
0.0	0.294945767463	Right and left are spending us into oblivion.
0.0	0.518010451496	We have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone.
0.0	0.300182059456	What we have to do right now is bring our people together and understand that we must provide a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people.
0.0	0.625268576205	We should put the NSA in charge of the civilian side of this as well.
0.0	0.351151181493	I will spend every ounce of energy to stop it.
0.0	0.255628133805	So I just truly, with all my heart belief, I like everybody on the stage.
0.0	0.421076017809	We sent our parks and wildlife wardens.
0.0	0.716745156404	Folks, the government has no business stealing even more from the people who have paid this in.
0.0	0.297243175599	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.297398618665	I know some people like to say, "well, this is free money."
0.0	0.608813055925	But we can do is defund Planned Parenthood, and by the way, put in place an absolute permanent ban on any taxpayer dollars ever being used to fund abortions.
0.0	0.848990063581	I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years, and by the way, one of the members of that committee was Senator Strom Thurmond from South Carolina.
0.0	0.517968697972	She wants to continue down the path of Iran, Benghazi, the Russian reset, Dodd-Frank, all the things that have -- that have gone wrong in this country, she would be a national security mess.
0.0	0.165420813693	There's -- look, there's --
0.0	0.411608096211	No one here is under FBI investigation.
0.0	0.517989039906	I have fought my entire life to make sure that healthcare is a right for all people.
0.0	0.250752338415	I want to -- before my time runs out I want to get back to this issue of ISIS versus Iran.
0.0	0.712148315859	And if we want to try to rebuild the coalition, as Governor Kasich was saying before, then what we better do is to get to the Arab countries that believe that ISIS is a threat, not only to them, but to us and to world peace, and bring them together.
0.0	0.192988571772	I think that's a major accomplishment.
0.0	0.720484146919	I deployed the National Guard after I stood on the ramp in Dallas, Texas and looked the president of the United States in the eye and said, "Mr. President, if you won't secure the border, Texas will," and that's exactly what we did.
0.0	0.38380582509	Now, on that tariff -- here's what I'm saying, China -- they send their goods and we don't tax it -- they do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.208885906813	Well, I respectfully disagree.
0.0	0.695867510189	Every progressive economist who has analyzed that says that the numbers don't add up, and that's a promise that cannot be kept, and it's really important now that we are getting into the rest of the country that both of us are held to account for explaining what we are proposing because, especially with healthcare, this is not about math.
0.0	0.759037510081	Iran sanctions -- the Iran sanctions that brought them to the table, those are sanctions that we put in place when I was in the United States Senate, and a whole host of other things that put me in a position of saying, I not only have a great vision, but I can govern effectively in Washington.
0.0	0.319124765181	This is an interesting point when you talk about immigration.

0.0	0.334306085642	(APPLAUSE) This is not a cage match.
0.0	0.704845931876	And what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice.
0.0	0.337895378643	So I believe as president I will look very carefully about unintended consequences.

0.0	0.685723637241	If it's Medicare for all, then you no longer have the Affordable Care Act, because the Affordable Care Act, as you know very well, is based on the insurance system, based on exchanges, based on a subsidy system.
0.0	0.614986854812	It's a private-sector solution that believes in freedom, not Obamacare that believes in government control.
0.0	0.60886173781	And I feel very strongly that I have an agenda, I have a record that really does respond to a lot of the specific needs that the women in our country face.

0.0	0.647656803254	The reason that I -- I hate them so much is because every single regulation costs in terms of goods and services.
0.0	0.207477072062	That's not true.
0.0	0.558540651038	You see, you have one side, the Democrats, and with immigration, all they care about is votes.
0.0	0.7017156403	You've seen middle-class wages go backwards $3,700 during the Obama administration.
0.0	0.333770550369	I know a lot of Americans are angry about the economy.
0.0	0.491696824555	But everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro- gay-marriage, focus around money and the media.
0.0	0.23261134021	Here's a fact.
0.0	0.628367619815	That should be a right of all Americans regardless of the income of their families.

0.0	0.416727775873	That's wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country.
0.0	0.47263937929	They do not get any credit for their care-taking responsibilities.
1.0	0.705443341289	It says that after 35 million people have come here over the last 20 years, almost all of whom are unskilled workers, flattening wages, creating horrible opportunity -- a lack of opportunities for unskilled workers, we're going to do something about reducing the level of immigration by 25 percent.
0.0	0.249337191228	I have a feeling it's going to work out, actually.

0.0	0.527560448867	Turns out that the African-American community and the Latino community were hit especially hard.
0.0	0.567526159277	And now they see Hillary Clinton proposing a third term of economic policy for our country.
0.0	0.330298692212	And if I am president and we get our hands on him, he is standing trial for treason.
0.0	0.393012112763	Just like getting rid of Medicare and Medicaid.
0.0	0.670606122993	...The only way we're going to be morale, the only way we're going to keep our promise to seniors is start by following the first rule we should all follow, which is to look at them, treat them like adults, and tell them the truth.
0.0	0.691483442939	We should be relying upon the leadership of the Congress to pass the laws.

0.0	0.424989891949	Maria -- Maria, what you were talking about just now is called corporate inversion.
0.0	0.290457404727	That is who I'm fighting for.
0.0	0.403379115496	If this country that does not keep its promise to seniors then what promise can this country hope to be trusted to keep?
0.0	0.641672691395	And that's why they have it in Europe, because it is a way to blindfolded the people, that's what Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.522439586655	And I say, look, it's not Republicans' fault, it's not Democrats' fault, it's your grandparents' fault for having too many damn kids.
0.0	0.194538640313	You're welcome.
0.0	0.5	We're asking the top 1.5 percent, including passive income, to start paying a little bit more so that the elderly and disabled vets in this country can live with security and dignity.
0.0	0.608879749985	We need the lawyers(ph) off the back of the war fighters.
1.0	0.805717478064	Ronald Regan opposed the value tax because he said it was a way to blindfold the people, so the true cost of government was not there there for them.
0.0	0.616575449033	When I was in Washington, I fought to get the budget balanced.
0.0	0.5449993569	It puts us on a level, even playing field, which brings jobs here at home...
0.0	0.61863621713	But what is to prevent a future liberal president or a liberal Congress from coming back and not just raising the income tax, but also raising that VAT tax, and that vat tax is really bad for seniors.
0.0	0.408385679148	... the fact is -- the fact is the reason why that no one wants to answer entitlements up here is because it's hard.
0.0	0.289874255261	I will tell you this, I will beat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.297444898132	And the problem, Maria, is that the military is not ready, either.
0.0	0.592447763403	The president has done an executive order with respect to illegal immigration that is illegal.
0.0	0.424207642977	We need all of them to be part of exactly what the first George Bush put together in the first Gulf War.
0.0	0.384475288087	It's easier to talk to your friends.
0.0	0.427816733821	The American people have rejected your agenda and now you're trying to go around it.
0.0	0.680920726792	There were four dissenters, and they said that they believe the Second Amendment protects no individual right to keep and bear arms whatsoever, which means, if their view prevailed and the next president's going to get one, two, three, maybe four Supreme Court justices, the court will rule that not a single person in this room has any right under the Second Amendment and the government could confiscate your guns.
0.0	0.574590935278	We're going to suspend -- I've -- I've said this for four years.
0.0	0.680988799554	After that you pay 10 percent as a flat tax going up.

0.0	0.228144297333	We do.
0.0	0.398808364755	That was not, as I understand it, the secretary's position.
0.0	0.304830550477	They go to Princeton.
0.0	0.450144293587	We're going to suspend and repeal every executive order, every regulation that cost American jobs and is -- is -- is impacting our freedom.
0.0	0.522814190784	Barack Obama believes that America is a arrogant global power that needs to be cut down to size.
0.0	0.594213695253	We've got a president who instead says, we're going to change hearts and minds.
0.0	0.329641480463	So you should go out, get a declaratory judgment, let the courts decide.
0.0	0.223933278155	Actually, I'd love to get you to build a wall.
0.0	0.256057006225	This is what's going on.
0.0	0.671702668304	This deal in Washington is an example of why Washington's broken.
0.0	0.38711977832	That's not the America that I've ever known.
0.0	0.616979118529	And nobody, nobody on either one of these stages has done more than I've done and the people of the State of Texas to deal with securing that border.
0.0	0.273480983343	And we can't be the stupid country any more.
0.0	0.448699793431	That's what they do, whether it's the San Bernardino attack or if it's these tragedies that take place, I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is.
0.0	0.237870935276	OK?
0.0	0.349713468416	Let me tell you, everybody, when they say they want to give it to you for free, keep your hands on your wallets because they're coming to you to pay for it.
0.0	0.895974693072	I just read today in the New York Times, $250,000 for a 30 second ad.
0.0	0.195081842755	We lose, we have a trade imbalance...
0.0	0.548671862557	Folks, we have a problem here with the leadership in Washington, but I'll tell you another problem.
0.0	0.679866575487	Here's my promise, at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country.
0.0	0.812877176622	The men and women on this stage have more ideas, more experience, more common sense than every participant in the Democratic debate.
0.0	0.586279240456	When I'm president of the United States, we are defending the Second Amendment, not undermining it the way Barack Obama does.
0.0	0.332527317221	I am convinced because I see how he works with his attorney general, not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.730705508193	He's got probably a four or five percent chance.
0.0	0.533188077837	It was a company that had grown into a bloated, inept bureaucracy that cost too much and delivered too little to customers and shareholders.
0.0	0.387899546384	We're going to start the process of securing that border.
0.0	0.638537115512	Well, you know, I think, from a historical point of view, somebody with my background, somebody with my views, somebody who has spent his entire life taking on the big money interests, I think a Sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment, as well.
0.0	0.505276338949	I will be the Ronald Reagan if I can find a Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.232511621303	It's not that hard.
0.0	0.732133723012	I'd also go after these sanctuary cities, do everything we can to make sure that we are not -- that we are actually prosecuting and cutting off funding for cities that are harboring illegal aliens, and then finally making sure the IRS is not going after conservative or religious groups.
0.0	0.295571045853	We have made it easier to do that, not harder.
1.0	0.24819738493	He has called him a disappointment.
0.0	0.522972039806	And in that meeting, I suggested we had a problem with technology, and that I wanted to take people from Silicon Valley into the Pentagon to solve our most significant problems.
0.0	0.296603445067	You can't do it with empty promised.
0.0	0.159285797551	And second, the international crisis we are facing is most dreadful and most dangerous.
0.0	0.467742627446	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.281693685093	In my view, it doesn't go anywhere near far enough.
0.0	0.168441540697	And I want to make this our government.
0.0	0.45057319386	You also have to some strategically cutting in several places.
0.0	0.138558118139	And I think that ought to be worth something.
0.0	0.691965982145	You're talking about $2.7 trillion.
0.0	0.312892952635	But let me go back to something that's very important.
0.0	0.602438620373	You know, I won two record elections.
0.0	0.363357677443	It's time for us to stand up for what we believe in.
0.0	0.321527042283	I didn't say permanently.
0.0	0.490053416988	But if we elect the right person -- if you elect me -- we will turn this country around, we will reclaim the American dream and this nation will be stronger and greater than it has ever been.
0.0	0.622422061411	Marco's top tax rate is 35 percent.
0.0	0.293226317923	He's an S corporation.
0.0	0.295353589206	You want to see a war on women?
0.0	0.404371508011	You know the nice thing about the mainstream media, they don't hide their views.
0.0	0.210115624802	I'm happy to answer the question...
0.0	0.483063278179	Well, first let me address the tax issue because it's related to the entitlement issue and I want to thank you for holding a substantive debates where we can have debates about these key issues on taxes.
0.0	0.316085916933	You know why three?
0.0	0.647649890795	Now that applies universally to giant corporations that with lobbyists right now are not paying taxes, and as small business.
0.0	0.644863653188	If I'm elected president, we will not let in refugees from countries controlled by ISIS or Al Qaida.
0.0	0.244685987485	Maria, let me clear something up here.
0.0	0.313885245228	We're closing hospitals, we're closing wards, we're closing so many because the states want to save money.
0.0	0.594034115535	I'm running for president because there is no way we can elect Hillary Clinton to continue the policies of Barack Obama.
0.0	0.438552028108	We need to begin by undoing -- I would begin by undoing a whole set of things that President Obama has done, whether it's illegal amnesty or this latest round of EPA regulations.
0.0	0.492311413626	We are trying to bring America together around an agenda that works for working families and the middle class.
0.0	0.480316483152	We've already got a great talker in the White House.
1.0	0.208057724062	That's wrong.
0.0	0.398803656381	You know what he said to me?
0.0	0.575477619628	Well, it's not a matter of what the first executive order would be, Bill.
0.0	0.372310358133	If we means test Social Security, it means that the government decides whether or not I deserve it.
0.0	0.667848880847	That's where crime is happening in these cities where they don't enforce the immigration laws.
0.0	0.484074385682	If I could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited.
0.0	0.210806775932	Let em also tell you...
1.0	0.251714849092	They cite Obamacare.
0.0	0.207320905995	And you know what?
0.0	0.493186921088	It's the only way you fix Medicare, the only way you fix Social Security.
0.0	0.800798617927	If we had guns in California on the other side where the bullets went in the different direction, you wouldn't have 14 or 15 people dead right now.
0.0	0.5	The truth is this, the big problem, we need a leader in Washington who understands how to get something done, not to talk about it, not to propose it, to get it done.
1.0	0.83700525768	It is also the case that that Rubio-Schumer amnesty bill, one of the things it did is it expanded Barack Obama's power to let in Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.403040352732	I came as a reformer.
0.0	0.453135280511	And -- and -- you know, it goes back to the whole concept of regulations, which are in everything.
0.0	0.333929202931	Well, when you look at the celebrity of Donald Trump, then I think that says a lot about it.
0.0	0.691840103302	So, let's not in anyway imply here that either President Obama or myself, would in anyway not take on any vested interested, whether it's Wall Street, or drug companies, or insurance companies, or frankly, the gun lobby to stand up to do what's best for the American people.
0.0	0.322221173556	Well, there's no question that ISIS is a very serious problem, and I don't believe that this administration recognizes how serious it is.
0.0	0.317469071399	I recommended that the president go forward.
0.0	0.603841361598	As you've indicated, what is happening in Syria, the number of people, the hundreds of thousands of people who have been killed -- men, women, 20,000 children, the people who are forced to flee their own country -- their own country -- it is unspeakable.
0.0	0.262383236542	... with what Marco is saying is that it takes too long, they're sucking us dry and it takes too long.
0.0	0.580518695232	Health savings accounts are something that we introduced.
0.0	0.627313828493	We just, earlier this week, kicked them out of Medicaid in Louisiana as well, canceled their provider contract.
1.0	0.78540677209	And we'll save a trillion dollars over the next 10 years.
0.0	0.543963229047	But I feel that the gun-free zones and, you know, when you say that, that's target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill. That's target.
1.0	0.655779432104	The blurb said that the next president of the United States has got to be aggressive in bringing people into the political process.
0.0	0.430268311796	The second will be to the supreme leader of Iran.
0.0	0.284295890689	It continues with regulatory reform.
0.0	0.237870935276	OK?
0.0	0.27330746949	Americans are tired of hearing this debate -- want to go to, what are you going to do about illegal immigration?
0.0	0.703387211995	In all due respect, Secretary Clinton, a lot of the progressive groups, the online groups have really asked you a simple question.
0.0	0.252022790085	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.292763620603	They were wrong.
1.0	0.570362315942	You used to support legalizing people that were here illegally, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.851822945685	It requires tax cuts, because that sends a message to the job creators that things are headed the right way.
0.0	0.561931891646	All over this country we have Republican candidates for president saying we hate the government.
0.0	0.246619921233	Gronkowski is still going strong.
0.0	0.366528738916	We need to be on the side that keeps Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.423768845274	There's a big question mark on your head.
0.0	0.42160688525	It's the only way to level the playing field between big and powerful and small and powerless.
0.0	0.663312078894	Yes, I thought about running four years ago.
0.0	0.186149276606	And you're not serious about destroying ISIL.
0.0	0.579884003623	We had this failed red line with Assad and it discouraged folks that want to help us on the ground.
0.0	0.199099078069	And they wonder whether somebody is getting something to -- keeping them from getting it.
0.0	0.20520086385	... and I know Bernie, and I can promise you he's not going to be president of the United States.
0.0	0.236898000856	Do we still have standards?
0.0	0.475630399495	don't listen to the Trumps of the world and allowing them to divide us.
0.0	0.36686492438	Oh yeah, we want to elect a good president, but America is great from the bottom-up, and the bottom-up is us in our families, in our communities, in our neighborhoods.
0.0	0.261704671896	And this is not an endeavor that rewards that.
0.0	0.5	There are loads of great ideas, great conservative ideas from wonderful think tanks about how to reform the tax code.
0.0	0.39952298762	But you haven't asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought I'd get that off my chest if you don't mind.
0.0	0.520692386329	Larry Kudlow is an example, who I have a lot of respect for, who loves my tax plan.
0.0	0.279306930085	That is our government today.
0.0	0.532627535317	I'm not going to have something that Ted described in his tax plan.
0.0	0.420114995555	And it's not too much to ask of our generation after everything our parents and our grandparents did for us.
0.0	0.223782794824	No.
0.0	0.825499872046	We went after companies that were doing things that were against the law.
0.0	0.18285987088	And that's why, as president, I will look at communities that need special help and try to deliver that.
0.0	0.244481005696	They can't even make a deal.
0.0	0.267138880983	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.340569822187	No criminal records for them.
0.0	0.33932791161	This is absolutely disgusting, and revolts the conscience of the nation.
0.0	0.604785617318	Watching this broadcast tonight are millions of people that are living paycheck to paycheck.
0.0	0.405121988814	America's at a crossroads.
0.0	0.297105989583	If this all works out, I'm happy to consider naming you as V.P.
0.0	0.795660332289	Back in 2004, one of my predecessors to the Senate by the name of Bob Graham, a Democrat, ran for president missing over 30 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.656733019991	So the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced: a simple flat tax, 10 percent for individuals, and a 16 percent business flat tax, you abolish the IRS...
0.0	0.373636381731	They don't provide any abortions in Louisiana.
0.0	0.363912634587	And we should back up the recent donors conference to make sure we have made our contribution to try to deal with the enormous cost that these refugees are posing to Turkey and to members of the E.U.
0.0	0.229354474863	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.173194187993	And when I look at Washington today, we need to bring us together.
0.0	0.472221161594	We can take many of those same procedures, we can apply it to Medicare.
0.0	0.717763221737	And you look around, and you see what's happening, and this is not the case when he introduced the doctor -- very nice, everything perfect but that is not representative of what you have in that line of migration.
0.0	0.374173776221	Both Donald and Jeb have good points, and there is a middle ground.
0.0	0.695220154377	We will use those proceeds, a hundred billion a year, to invest in rebuilding our infrastructure.
0.0	0.550536620213	Because the more you tax something, the less of it you get.
0.0	0.298003822856	Here is where we are with public education.
0.0	0.648140113156	What I did in New York was bring people together, an overwhelmingly Democratic state.
0.0	0.252977231878	We have to shut down, whether or not they're in prisons preaching or on -- in mosques preaching.
0.0	0.696599167573	Here's why, the president of the United States and both his attorney's general, they give the benefit of the doubt to the criminal, not to the police officers.
0.0	0.177566608623	I believe in government, but I believe in efficient government, not wasteful government.
0.0	0.639998724954	And, it was made for we the people, we are the ones who decide who we are, and we should never give away the values and principles that made America into a great nation for the sake of political correctness.
0.0	0.675558930789	We need leadership, someone who has a backbone and sticks with things, rather than just talks about them as though anything matters when you're talking about amendments that don't even actually are part of a bill that ever passed.
0.0	0.429263360242	And frankly, it just came out, and in Iowa now, as you know, Ted, in the last three polls, I'm beating you.
0.0	0.317672285137	I want to speak to all our fighting men and women.
0.0	0.664181486668	There is one major country -- the United States -- which ends up spending almost three times per capita what they do in the U.K. guaranteeing health care to all people, 50 percent more than they do in France guaranteeing health care to all people, far more than our Canadian neighbors, who guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.836127392438	You know, we have a war on virtual everything -- race wars, gender wars, income wars, religious wars, age wars.
0.0	0.237870935276	OK.
0.0	0.541471845621	You also have to get rid of all the deductions and all the loopholes.
0.0	0.834469696587	President Obama's preparing to send $100 billion or more to the Ayatollah Khamenei.
0.0	0.44157543843	You didn't see it for a minute.
0.0	0.438373071747	There's nobody out there looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.446237662729	Come with me to Iraq and Afghanistan, folks.
0.0	0.536581018206	I've created tens of thousands of jobs, and in all due respect -- and actually some of these folks I really like a lot -- but I'm the only one that can say that.
0.0	0.39092563709	And what I have concluded is that the best policy is to get rid of all government subsidies, and get the government out of our lives, and let people rise and fall based on how good they are.
0.0	0.41967658647	We have a world that's out of control and has grown dangerous and a president that is weakening our military and making our foreign policy unstable and unreliable in the eyes of our allies.
0.0	0.672494913798	And Senator Sanders's plan really rests on making sure that governors like Scott Walker contribute $23 billion on the first day to make college free.
0.0	0.591881896716	When I was 22, my dad died.
0.0	0.565906418505	John Kasich, will you insult two people over here?
0.0	0.642894796956	And that's why I've come forward with, for example, a plan to revitalize coal country, the coalfield communities that have been so hard hit by the changing economy, by the reduction in the use of coal.
0.0	0.347150684317	They want those planes made in China.
0.0	0.351350051584	It begins with tax reform.
0.0	0.261478647086	Just know where you want to go, stick to your guts.
0.0	0.241166417682	Right.
0.0	0.240438574653	MACCALLUM: Thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.367750667838	Yes, they have to stop being the main state sponsor of terrorism.
1.0	0.830782168682	All that's in that trust fund is a pile of IOUs for money they spent on something else a long time ago.
0.0	0.418136858148	We've saved billions of dollars.
0.0	0.288526871239	But honestly, if you're a small business owner today you are being crushed.
0.0	0.346956539054	I am proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend.
0.0	0.686148709127	I also believe that marriage is between one man and one woman.
0.0	0.553352768907	And in your heart of hearts, you cannot wait to see a debate between Hillary Clinton and Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.267498713084	And he got nasty.
0.0	0.591481794198	I would do that to Barack Obama's executive orders.
1.0	0.661985617635	I'll tell you what else they're upset about: you're 50 or 51 years old, and some kid walks in and tells you you're out of work, and you don't know where to go and where to turn.
0.0	0.72617505917	And I will assure you, as the governor of the state of Texas, and as those last four years have shown me, the preparation to be ready to stand on this stage and talk about those monetary policies, those domestic policies, and those foreign policies, Americans are going to see that I am ready to be that individual.
0.0	0.308642414579	They didn't do that.
0.0	0.5	And the way we've done it properly through regulatory action, not buy signing unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.343728229718	When I'm president of the United States we are getting rid of Obamacare and we are rebuilding our military.
0.0	0.194274195861	But look...
0.0	0.159654932762	And then we need to shut down -- we need to shut down their mechanisms of funding and attack their command-and-control centers.
0.0	0.227284065471	A terrible sight.
0.0	0.646756278562	I understand both of these issues, how to build the economy and doing that as a governor who'd built jobs, had cut taxes and also a governor who understands foreign-policy, and that's why I entered this race.
0.0	0.30082291685	I ask for your support to build, together, a safer and stronger America.
1.0	0.459734497984	What Hillary Clinton's going to say, and has said before is, she wants to raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.160144900441	I think that's a mistake.
0.0	0.391208191323	And I'm very grateful to the brave Navy SEALs who carried out that mission.
0.0	0.256816629017	As far as Mark is concerned, as far as the visas are concerned, if we need people, they have -- it's fine.
0.0	0.335760608463	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.654818264848	And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, because I've been a leader on these issues.
0.0	0.238284526628	You target the bad guys.
0.0	0.232128662885	You do the arithmetic.
0.0	0.207320905995	And you know what?
0.0	0.164871478674	You just want to...
0.0	0.219318227745	You can have him.
0.0	0.148022519627	And I believe that the best way to do that is to be aggressive, to be principled, but to have the goal of trying to improve relations.
0.0	0.60192038649	Because only if it's about three pages are you leveling the playing field between the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected who can hire the armies of lawyers and accountants and, yes, lobbyists to help them navigate their way through 73,000 pages.
0.0	0.172502452574	We have a serious problem with, as you know, with radical Islam.
0.0	0.552614408518	Why aren't we talking about -- instead of cutting benefits for old people, cutting benefits for sick people -- why don't we say, "let's cure the four big cost-driving diseases...
0.0	0.818137082748	And that is that one of the things you're watching tonight are 11 quality candidates debating an important issue.
1.0	0.671195078372	They were watching the humiliation of our young ten sailors, sitting on the floor with their knees in a begging position, their hands up.
0.0	0.529360064834	And, sending mixed signals to kids about drugs is a disaster.
0.0	0.164189959085	Well, Maria, thank you for that question, and let me say thank you to the state of South Carolina for welcoming us.
0.0	0.411944688313	They don't care about American workers, they just care about bringing as many people in so they can get as many votes as they can.
0.0	0.393309246443	Maria, I'd like to interrupt this debate on the floor of the Senate to actually answer the question you asked, which was on entitlements.
0.0	0.67020263563	But I'm not worried about my finances, I'm worried about the finances of everyday Americans who today are struggling in an economy that is not producing good paying jobs while everything else costs more.
0.0	0.283339723802	But I have no argument with anyone making up her mind about who to support.
0.0	0.453644470028	So yes, you're going to hear a lot of talk about tax reform --
0.0	0.232396044148	SuperPacs are a disaster.
0.0	0.236845147606	Government is the enemy.
0.0	0.619404170638	Let me just add one thing about ISIS over there.
0.0	0.212726573236	Number -- and that is important for you to know.
0.0	0.246621318805	Let me tell you, if we don't get this election right, there may be no turning back for America.
0.0	0.423085138867	Imagine a country where the middle class can get rising income again.
0.0	0.438338007152	You know, a minute ago, Neil asked: What has President Obama do -- done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns?
0.0	0.430106370893	Remember, we have 645 federal agencies and sub-agencies.
0.0	0.231161671782	They're a scam.
0.0	0.444430749035	We need to solve problems, we need to rebuild our military so we can stand up to radical Islam, we need to get our economy growing much faster by throwing out the corrupt tax code and lowering the rates.
0.0	0.207877039138	That's not right.
0.0	0.767567760034	And remember this, after Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have had nearly 8 years, we have fewer democracies in the world than we had when they started.
0.0	0.1751384259	Let's hope that it holds.
0.0	0.175728627373	I think the times are much more serious.
0.0	0.5	Let's let a Justice Department -- and I will make an attorney general who will enforce the law and make justice more than just a word.
0.0	0.605693469173	But I knew that good people who wanted to be a part of the American dream have become trapped in dependency because the federal government and the state government had made it in their economic interest not to take a job because the benefits that they didn't work were better.
0.0	0.548071582189	Because of all the federal mandates and federal laws, it was too expensive.
0.0	0.465986244969	My mother is on Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.13803998895	And I think together we will make progress.
0.0	0.244306249562	We also need a nominee, a candidate who will endorse our own principles.
0.0	0.776106967011	It's now half the size of what it was prior to Operation Desert Storm.
0.0	0.265511429096	How are we going to do this?
0.0	0.350418037849	That's how you make peace in the world.
0.0	0.483574628643	He's been a good governor, and he's a heck of a lot better than his predecessor that would have bankrupted New Jersey.
0.0	0.440787454088	Bernie Sanders has already said it.
0.0	0.391068555361	I was not at all.
0.0	0.269315446855	If you'll answer the (inaudible) core question.
0.0	0.577988807628	Right now, corporations, by the thousands, are thinking of leaving our country with the jobs -- leave them behind.
0.0	0.308855057907	The Syrians should stay in Syria.
0.0	0.337452208243	I'm against anything that's bad for my mother.
0.0	0.830654235008	Any connection maybe to the fact that our people pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs?
0.0	0.639502255736	And my record was one of cutting taxes each and every year.
0.0	0.38168154781	We differ, however, on a couple of key points.
0.0	0.186609631536	And I'm not blaming these folks -- but I guess I could.
0.0	0.717223097569	Because of a series of disastrous trade policies which have allowed corporate America through NAFTA and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, Secretary Clinton and I disagree on those issues.
0.0	0.766683345264	One thing I like to remind people is, back in 2007, Rudy Giuliani was leading the polls for almost a year.
0.0	0.437179464353	This president and John Kerry and Hillary Clinton all have made it harder for the next president to act, but he must act to confront the ambitions of Iran.
0.0	0.275422728572	We need to be very well aware of the fact that China and Russia are using technology to attack us, just as ISIS is using technology to recruit those who would murder American citizens.
0.0	0.669685517385	We will rebuild the military to make sure that it is a solid force, not to be the world's policeman, but to make sure that in a peaceful world, people know that the United States is there to take care of our own national interests and take care of our allies.
0.0	0.802759907566	We have to get the other 10 percent of the way to 100.
0.0	0.189579518229	...Chris...
1.0	0.745581337502	We had a $1.4 trillion deficit.
0.0	0.371635533754	To the 1 percent who have been fighting this war for over a decade, I'd try my best to be a commander-in-chief worthy of your sacrifice.
0.0	0.429006259387	So, yes, I do believe that when we talk about public education in America, today, in a rapidly changing world, we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities.
1.0	0.793007294813	Under longstanding U.S. law, the child of a U.S. citizen born abroad is a natural-born citizen.
1.0	0.693484215601	Becky, if you want a 10 percent flat tax where the numbers add up, I rolled out my tax plan today, you can find it on line at tedcruz.org.
0.0	0.277750800349	There have been some good recommendations about what needs to happen.
0.0	0.228377185999	We'll just clean it up.
0.0	0.295318542674	They didn't do that either.
0.0	0.220212500755	But I'm going to tell you the truth.
0.0	0.594487133568	What a president of the United States has got to do -- and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility -- is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe, that we work with allies around the world to protect...
0.0	0.531521471451	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the Constitution.
0.0	0.18915959718	We need to control the border, we need to do all of this in a comprehensive way, not just going back and forth and talking about stuff --
0.0	0.705791713234	And I'm the only one up on this stage who back in April put forward a detailed entitlement reform plan that will save over $1 trillion, save Social Security, save Medicare, and avoid this -- avoid what Hillary Rodham Clinton will do to you.
0.0	0.367428246774	Think back to Garland, Texas.
0.0	0.280274317263	When people ask me, whose fault is it?
0.0	0.680046808354	I've heard about tax schemes that don't add up, that put our kids in -- in a deeper hole than they are today.
0.0	0.123562253746	...we need to honor our promises...
0.0	0.227562251999	And that's what I intend to do.
0.0	0.207235193816	And guess what?
0.0	0.462793984881	Because, first of all, you may rename the IRS but you are not going to abolishes the IRS, because there has to be some agency that's going to collect your vat tax.
0.0	0.896191239857	In many ways, a college degree today is equivalent to what a high school degree was 50, 60 years ago.
0.0	0.422265723087	So the indignation that you carry on, some of the stuff, you have to also own then.
0.0	0.802899036765	There is one major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.732127876556	So, we're talking about -- we're talking about reform for people like me and people like Senator Cruz, as he talked about earlier, who are years away from retirement that have a way to plan for these changes, and way that's very reasonable.
0.0	0.599601878516	Where basically, businesses now will have to pay a tax, both on the money they make, but they also have to pay taxes on the money that they pay their employees.
0.0	0.430015773298	It will create a manufacturing juggernaut in this country.
0.0	0.564660820948	There was nothing to this birther issue.
0.0	0.304183755551	Alzheimers, diabetes, heart disease and cancer.
0.0	0.434732111749	This issue now has to be about stopping ISIS entering the United States, and when I'm president we will.
0.0	0.427523720901	We've cut taxes, balanced budgets, changed the regulatory environment.
0.0	0.271246647373	It's time for real substance and real experience.
0.0	0.297671960664	What's crony capitalism?
0.0	0.37755059827	There'll be people here that will talk about what they're going to do.
0.0	0.328671561026	I am the only person in either campaign that's self-funding.
0.0	0.155446472558	I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.305029551592	We both agree that we have to get unaccountable money out of our political system and that we have to do much more to ensure that Wall Street never wrecks main street again.
0.0	0.172149902847	If that's not hypocrisy, I don't know what hypocrisy is.
0.0	0.310589648797	And so that was his explanation.
0.0	0.211881233863	That is absolutely not right.
0.0	0.298400110788	I just want to remind you, people paid their money.
0.0	0.640468212823	She actually ran against one of my friends and our head of public safety.
0.0	0.217209900074	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.390024213263	And you don't go tell Muslim nations you want them to be part of a coalition when you have a leading candidate for president of the United States who insults their religion.
0.0	0.223482799789	Thank you.

0.0	0.222561486805	No, no.

0.0	0.302733692013	That's was hard work.
0.0	0.276063647317	That could be the great Trojan Horse.

0.0	0.297774594312	We can do that in Washington.

0.0	0.238683175964	We can do a wall.
0.0	0.241716502093	It's not that complicated actually.

0.0	0.22819129396	This stuff is fantasy.
0.0	0.831706489332	In the same light, as the foreign leader, Winston Churchill's politics were not my politics.
0.0	0.280182426182	So, are we going to ban Muslims from India, from Indonesia, from countries that are strong allies -- that we need to build better relationships with?
0.0	0.533213956888	It appears that the same someone who has been whispering in old Marco's ear too.
0.0	0.783496586284	In 2011, the sequester was passed as a reform to slow down the rate of government.
0.0	0.246240031819	I mean, just think about a scenario like that.
0.0	0.285962422873	We have not provided them.
0.0	0.239552476459	I have fully endorsed those.
0.0	0.513639647939	So I not only had the opportunity to go through the Cold War struggles in Central America, and even after 9/11 to be involved.
0.0	0.700851308516	It has to be based on what skills you have, what you can contribute economically, and most important of all, on whether or not you're coming here to become an American, not just live in America, but be an American.
0.0	0.828615203597	The Children's Health Insurance Program, which I helped to create, which covers 8 million kids, is also a different kind of program.

0.0	0.190635576705	How do I know this?
0.0	0.304137053956	And I just couldn't agree -- disagree more with those kinds of comments.
0.0	0.516068237297	I think our country is tired of the politicians who simply read the polls and fail to lead.
0.0	0.605940471841	You see what the Saudi's -- deliver them a strong message but at the end of the day we have to keep our cool because most of the time they're going right with us.
0.0	0.351545558894	I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would.
0.0	0.600594629738	The statistics from Wisconsin are particularly troubling, because it is the highest rate of incarceration for African-Americans in our nation, twice the national average.
0.0	0.477384573194	So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States.
0.0	0.278193327368	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.226869037602	And at that point, it's a life that we have the right to protect, and I think we should protect.
0.0	0.314886200102	Let's talk about our campaigns.
1.0	0.847028006593	And by the way, when I left, there were over 1 million fewer people on welfare in New York state than when I took office...
0.0	0.657472656781	And that's why Ronald Reagan said that it was a blindfold.
0.0	0.215603278579	Let people play, who cares?
1.0	0.529508179568	Ted Cruz, you used to say you supported doubling the number of green cards, now you say that you're against it.
0.0	0.574114827593	But what happens if, God forbid, the next Barack Obama takes over, and the next Nancy Pelosi, and the next Harry Reid...
0.0	0.328133179075	You just don't make promises like this.
0.0	0.451198541752	I want to go back for a second thought on this issue of income inequality.
0.0	0.46029384757	We have work to do, and we now know a lot more than we ever did before.
0.0	0.337122670714	-- the issue is who is going to get it done.
0.0	0.2675923127	And I'll tell you, it was heartbreaking.
0.0	0.277152910998	I'm deadly serious about doing this job the right way.
0.0	0.237870935276	Yeah.
0.0	0.410225841704	Get over that one, OK?
0.0	0.544522103553	We have to do this in unison with the Arab world.
0.0	0.586649241658	I would like to take a hard look at every part of the federal government and really do the kind of analysis that would rebuild some confidence in people that we're taking a hard look about what we have, you know, and what we don't need anymore.
0.0	0.328772554403	They're off to China.
0.0	0.641173374457	I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King.
0.0	0.296423071838	You've got to have a clear vision of where you want to go.
0.0	0.207877039138	That's not right.
0.0	0.762343505447	All the way back to when Ronald Reagan signed a piece of legislation that basically allowed for amnesty for over 4 million people, and the border is still not secure.
0.0	0.413469066279	I say, yes, not only do we give them what they need, but we don't tie their hands behind their backs so that they can go ahead and get the job done.
0.0	0.507955743076	They're looking -- they're looking to manipulate our -- the visa waiver countries to get people into the United States.
0.0	0.455516578912	And we just got to make sure that every American has the tools, in K-through-12 and in vocational education, in higher education.
0.0	0.685650101538	I think they made the Second Amendment the second amendment because they thought it was just that important.
1.0	0.568052468323	And if you tax cuts -- if you cut taxes for corporations, and you cut taxes for individuals, you're going to make things move, particularly the corporate tax, which is the highest, of course, in the -- in the world.
0.0	0.143325043376	This is a remarkable and horrifying fact.
0.0	0.227269005248	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.438375738065	I would just say this, we've heard a lot of great ideas up here, and I agree with what Senator Rubio said.
0.0	0.675233232157	For 30 years this country has been baited with that.
0.0	0.620382310708	Nobody wants to watch three and a half, or three hours.
0.0	0.223482799789	Thank you.
0.0	0.211684709658	Can we stop?
0.0	0.255047375328	So let's start -- let's start with immigration.
0.0	0.349032352069	Let me tell you who Larry Tribe is.
0.0	0.275364817806	We have a lot of work to do with Iran before we ever say that they could move toward normalized relations with us.
0.0	0.210143753988	Well, let me just -- let me just say, once again...
0.0	0.541181583778	Somebody who is very fond of the president, agrees with him most of the time, I disagree with his recent deportation policies.
0.0	0.203518448656	And when they let me down, if they let me down, I never forgive.
0.0	0.346907259502	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.212840091481	Becky --
0.0	0.736041269448	When extraordinarily wealthy people make very large contributions to Super PACs, and in many cases in this campaign, Super PACs have raised more money than individual candidates have, OK?
0.0	0.225998004839	But now as I travel the country, people say what I feel.
0.0	0.385248601327	You know how many votes John McCain missed when he was carrying out that furious comeback that you're now modeling after?
0.0	0.236343396974	Just a little bit.
0.0	0.257053312362	And I'll tell you, I'm not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump.
0.0	0.33640507979	Well, it ain't Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.425621891682	Now, I find it rather amazing, because I happen to believe that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country.
0.0	0.228526340108	Actually a close friend.
0.0	0.223956684983	I know the Democrats have the ultimate SuperPac.
0.0	0.337817522644	Let's start with immigration and have a little bit of clarity.
0.0	0.378073276924	Why didn't they call the police?
0.0	0.344274045052	But, here is a pledge I've made throughout this campaign, and it's really not a very radical pledge.
0.0	0.420397846816	So if you're having Medicare for all, single-payer, you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing.
0.0	0.460362374924	I think America is just a few good decisions and a leadership change at the top away from the best years we've ever had.
0.0	0.2688186651	We're going to cut costs.
0.0	0.228016224836	They have a responsibility, as well.
1.0	0.61450259387	Secondly, I never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.479755765091	We're going to have a big, fat beautiful door right in the middle of the wall.
0.0	0.601234649734	... and here's the critical point, Maria -- the business flat tax enables us to abolish the corporate income tax, the death tax, the Obamacare taxes, the payroll taxes, and they're border-adjustable, so every export pays no taxes whatsoever.
0.0	0.375709834339	The question always is, what works better, the private marketplace or government?
0.0	0.427987783594	If they had guns, he wouldn't be around very long.
0.0	0.240715892176	Now, he's doing better.
0.0	0.328862803112	What have you got now?
0.0	0.382979092466	It's the New York Times, they are always wrong.
0.0	0.235420558568	We have Arab allies.
0.0	0.530644209762	I think Americans want someone to have a track record of showing them how to get this country back on record, someone who will stand up and every day project that best days of America are in front of us.
0.0	0.78746515633	This has gone on 50 or 60 years where the United States has been involved in overthrowing governments.
0.0	0.470666969697	I'll tell you, in my family there are a lot of single moms in my family.
0.0	0.361129076281	I choose him as my vice presidential candidate, and the Democrats sue because we can't take him along for the ride.
0.0	0.362665923643	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.298799209499	Community- based businesses and farms are getting crushed.
0.0	0.584673715408	No, not a comic book, and it's not a very nicely asked question the way you say that.
0.0	0.190242507293	And...
1.0	0.773568044743	I vetoed a statewide I.D. system for gun owners and I pardoned, six out-of-state folks who came through our state and were arrested for owning a gun legally in another state so they never have to face charges.
0.0	0.892498087235	I started as a secretary and became ultimately the chief executive of the largest technology company in the world, almost $90 billion in over 150 countries.
0.0	0.372100511481	The D.C. politicians continue to make things worse.
0.0	0.163025339064	So I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.299038242399	The guns don't pull the trigger.
0.0	0.27482919267	And -- and -- and the last piece of this, Maria, is this.
0.0	0.241018353508	And our adversaries continue to grow stronger.
1.0	0.705004837401	One out of five Americans can't even afford the prescriptions their doctors are writing.
0.0	0.714392450428	And when it began, we had no political organization, no money, and not much name recognition outside of the state of Vermont.
0.0	0.193555982425	They are more likely to know what's happening in their families and their communities, and they need to feel not just invited, but welcomed within the American society.
0.0	0.252313903189	You get the Congress.
0.0	0.617232534132	And when you do that, when you're in a position of managing regulations; when you reduce taxes; and when you have fiscal discipline, you see the job creators begin to get very comfortable with the fact that they can invest.
0.0	0.297112901453	That is what I could do for the country.
0.0	0.490163443016	Look, the -- the simple fact is that my plan actually gives the middle class the greatest break: $2,000 per family.
0.0	0.426578913832	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.448638258831	And guess what, in 2011, I got a deal...
1.0	0.769145258042	We're spending $80 billion a year locking up fellow Americans.
0.0	0.407646249905	Two points.
0.0	0.207320905995	And you know what?
0.0	0.423296856234	So we do as the United States have to support our friends, our allies in Europe.
0.0	0.783068435176	We'll tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money.
0.0	0.540835762121	Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well.
0.0	0.162208827245	Yes, I might feel more comfortable.
0.0	0.299403332727	I think President Obama has set a great example.
0.0	0.283074615377	They haven't done that.
0.0	0.192565017334	Well, I don't know.
0.0	0.229974834247	Total propaganda.
0.0	0.211920751551	What should we do?
0.0	0.180300178027	I'm going to keep making sure that everything I've done, everything that I stand for is going to be well known.
0.0	0.393482788489	That will never happen when I am president of the United States.
0.0	0.245584510238	First of all, yes, we've stolen.
0.0	0.232348886215	You know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money.
0.0	0.595801736792	Secretary Clinton has been going around the country saying Bernie Sanders wants to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, people are going to lose their MedicAid, they're going to lose their CHIP program.
0.0	0.397105573195	In other words, the very rich are getting richer, almost everybody is going -- getting poorer.
0.0	0.319027666846	You opposed him then.
0.0	0.510255085906	And as someone who's worn the uniform of the country, that's how we build our military back up.
0.0	0.21102287637	And let me say this also.
0.0	0.432677602706	This nation has been great to me, and that's the only way I know to pay you back.
0.0	0.433449492035	And I think this has become something that needs to be looked at in terms of regulation.
0.0	0.267233593664	And we're talking about fantasy football?
0.0	0.217500664363	You know why?
0.0	0.42891411886	But -- if for some reason, Neil, he beats the rest of the field, I already know the Democrats are going to be bringing a suit.
0.0	0.62524057349	What this campaign is about is creating a process for a political revolution in which millions of Americans, working people who have given up on the political process, they don't think anybody hears their pains or their concerns.
0.0	0.749017645646	I have the experience as a prosecutor, attorney general, governor, United States Army intelligence veteran, governor during the 9/11 attack, chairman of the Terrorism Commission for this country.
0.0	0.435253787326	ISIS came in, and now occupies significant territory in Libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold.
0.0	0.293840859612	We have gutted our ability to detect the next attack.
0.0	0.162977822609	I know this, I certainly am.
0.0	0.834898197012	If you look at a single mom buying groceries, she sees hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent.
0.0	0.185188090924	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.57816667522	But Iran is at the heart of most of the evil that is going on in the Middle East through their proxies.
0.0	0.510734679155	The rest of the world is moving away from us towards other alliances because we are weak.
0.0	0.203920107314	The answer is yes.
0.0	0.559653436369	But nobody can deny that as a wartime leader, he rallied the British people when they stood virtually alone against the Nazi juggernaut and rallied them and eventually won an extraordinary victory.
0.0	0.692980535468	Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns.
0.0	0.30090650046	I have worked for his re-election.
0.0	0.64337449692	But the best way to close this gap is to modernize higher education so Americans have the skills for those jobs.
0.0	0.223782794824	No.
0.0	0.361523840353	But you ought to acknowledge the government doesn't do a very good job at it.
1.0	0.737006691613	Well, the average small manufacturer, whatever they're manufacturing, drugs or anything, if they have less than 50 employees, the average cost in terms of regulations is $34,000 per employee.
0.0	0.444843852192	And by the way, it's not just on immigration, you used to support TPA, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.648139242181	Well, first of all, when we talk about the Import Export Bank, it's time to clean up corporate welfare.
0.0	0.856055183532	We even had warnings about the Boston Marathon bombers, and yet the dots weren't connected.
0.0	0.5	Well, listen, I've spent my entire life defending the Constitution before the U.S. Supreme Court.
0.0	0.571634359342	And if I am elected president, to every soldier and sailor and airman and marine, and to every police officer and firefighter and first responder who risk their lives to keep us safe, I will have your back.
0.0	0.394337900662	But I will tell you this, Atlantic City, you're using that, hundreds of companies that I have opened have thrived.
0.0	0.451896525987	As a senator, yes, I was a senator.
0.0	0.249198814193	Why is that?
0.0	0.368512101353	In my world, we'll focus on energy independence and a clean environment.
0.0	0.613426808737	Now, let me ask you a question everybody, and, this is for the guy, you know, who owns a landscaping business out there.
0.0	0.359224809151	You get the Congress, you get the Senate, you get together, you do legislation.
0.0	0.248140279717	That's the difference.
0.0	0.22828488965	No, it should be repealed.
0.0	0.240408455891	I agree with them.
0.0	0.241166417682	Right.
0.0	0.5	And somebody walked in and shot them, killed them.
0.0	0.544547483645	I've had my issues with Donald Trump.
0.0	0.189390550067	And I think the focus ought to be on making sure that we leave this nomination process, as wild and woolly as it's going to be -- this is not being bad.
0.0	0.187765883186	And believe me, Assad is not worth it.
0.0	0.403684131827	I will do so in a way that will bring people together.
0.0	0.805657131195	It's always a solution of the left to create more Government from the Federal Government.
0.0	0.166650160757	We don't need that.
0.0	0.839342709856	Well, they're the ones not listening to the scientists today, because doctors say that at 20 weeks that is a viable life inside the womb.
0.0	0.718563169896	In fact, it's the chief argument by democrats against many of the different flat tax proposals.
0.0	0.283525654066	We lose on trade.
0.0	0.478711258893	And I believe that not only Barney Frank, Paul Krugman, and others, have said that what I have proposed is the most effective.
0.0	0.588199886245	You know, some of these -- these engagement rules that the administration has -- "we're not going to bomb a tanker that's coming out of there because there might be a person in it" -- give me a break.
0.0	0.267663417835	We're going to cut Medicare and Medicaid, federal aid to education to help you, because the government is so terrible.
0.0	0.577806561552	That cost gets passed on to the people.
0.0	0.216759409994	We need to arm the Kurds the directly.
0.0	0.441400770277	Marco voted on the other side.
0.0	0.399172989762	You know, you had Herbert Hoover before that saying, no, we got to only worry about the deficit.
0.0	0.169632915464	No, that's -- you're wrong.
0.0	0.319509440551	I do, however, believe in Reagan's 11th commandment, and will not be engaging in awful things about my compatriots here.
0.0	0.608824219201	Then you have to get rid of Larry Kudlow, who sits on your panel, who's a great guy, who came out the other day and said, I love Trump's tax plan.
0.0	0.333910708645	Actually going to do something to help the American worker.
0.0	0.243142844325	My background is different.
0.0	0.19948931528	Well, it's interesting.
0.0	0.433748680699	They built the great wall of China.
0.0	0.305772929676	That's why I ask for your support for president.
0.0	0.428727883659	Today, I'm 60, I'm not married, I don't have any kids.
0.0	0.329183978693	It's not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.464764308294	Well, Neil, I'm glad we're focusing on the important topics of the evening.
0.0	0.542770065944	You're going to get it by paying your employees less and charging your customers more, that is a tax, the difference is, you don't see it on the bill.
0.0	0.697467468017	Now, the fact is, what this president has done is invited Russia to play an even bigger role, bring in Vladimir Putin to negotiate getting those chemical weapons back from Assad, yet what do we have today?
0.0	0.294658063579	And you think about the reasons that we're having such difficulty right now with our job market.
0.0	0.478284277844	You know, of the few questions I've got, the last one I need is to give him some more time.
0.0	0.46833474622	We elected someone as president who wants to change America, who wants to make it more like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.352705218305	We cannot elect somebody that doesn't know how to do the job.
0.0	0.697894327112	With respect to the United States, I think our role in NATO, our support for the E.U., as well as our willingness to take refugees so long as they are thoroughly vetted and that we have confidence from intelligence and other sources that they can come to our country, we should be doing our part.
0.0	0.195862602884	And that's why we must make sure we continue to frack.
0.0	0.32116591026	I was the architect.
0.0	0.584405922957	And the people who are often the most hard-hit are widows, because when their spouse dies, they can lose up to one-half of their Social Security monthly payment.
0.0	0.582862525442	Well, there is no question that some people go overboard when it comes to trying to make profits, and they don't take into consideration the American people.
0.0	0.184924805889	We need to tell folks who want to come here, they need to come here legally.
0.0	0.208619427854	And I want to just suggest to you.
0.0	0.611157844201	You have got to pick somebody who has experience, somebody that has the know-how, the discipline.
0.0	0.286381394488	I'm a Catholic, I believe life begins at conception.
0.0	0.434381118862	And I said, "well, if he wanted to play a song, maybe he could play, 'New York, New York'?"
0.0	0.728973577859	It increases the per child tax credit, because I didn't read about this in a book.
0.0	0.401769965865	But Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term, and you should be showing up to work.
0.0	0.724461754788	Well first of all, the idea that somehow we're better off today than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated president of the United States is totally an alternative universe.
0.0	0.516537958628	They worked hard to provide us the chance at a better life.
0.0	0.444436123568	Absolutely, they should fight to fund -- defund Planned Parenthood, and I don't think the president should shut down the government simply to send our taxpayer dollars to this group.
0.0	0.225742934342	My father used to say, "Johnny, we never -- we don't hate the rich.
0.0	0.478073405581	We've got a president who cannot bring himself to say the words "radical Islamic terrorism."
0.0	0.707196242075	And by the way, the attack he keeps throwing out on the military budget, Marco knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion.
0.0	0.265072027146	But we also need to reform Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.289081576163	It's like them getting mugged, and then us saying, well, we're going to mug you some more.
0.0	0.393527346135	The agreement on humanitarian relief now needs to be implemented, because there are enclaves that are literally filled with starving people throughout Syria.
0.0	0.303738077538	I hope Congress says no to this deal.
0.0	0.331440844957	I'll tell them that we're going to grow the economy so that we can give people better opportunities so they don't have to rely exclusively on benefit types of programs.
0.0	0.230303973684	We both want to get more revenue in.
1.0	0.852989343716	Not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama and the big government economy, the median wage for women has dropped $733.
0.0	0.448619573621	Bill, I defeated Mario Cuomo.
0.0	0.339650367805	We don't need to raise taxes to get this done.
0.0	0.523800579833	But Jeb is also right that, if we just impose a tariff, they'll put reciprocal tariffs, which will hurt Iowa farmers and South Carolina producers and 20 percent of the American jobs that depend on exports.
0.0	0.630610278533	And remember this -- I'm credible on this for this reason: Americans for Tax Reform says that I've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history.
0.0	0.340697158862	They said they'd shrink and balance the budget.
0.0	0.321677957777	Our rights come from God.
0.0	0.212840091481	Neil...
0.0	0.7775437019	Well, this is one of the reasons why Tom Perkins and I had disagreements in the boardroom, Becky.
0.0	0.545453937506	People lost their jobs, their homes, their life savings.
0.0	0.640126231774	It shifts it to the business, and it would allow middle class people to get a tax cut.
0.0	0.398972198227	And where we are right now is we have got to stand up to the Trumps of the world who are trying to divide us up.
0.0	0.354879361057	I just left Indonesia -- bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb.
0.0	0.1892714554	These...
0.0	0.394035114944	If you look at the numbers, there are actually as many, if not more white communities that are truly being left behind and left out.
0.0	0.431166918011	... the American middle class, and who are being attacked by ideologues, by demagogues.
0.0	0.332240595411	The only reason why you're doing it now is because we're running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.
0.0	0.800746118741	I was an Army intelligence agent and a veteran during the Cold War, assigned to West Germany.
0.0	0.379022717994	So there's a lot of balanced interests.
0.0	0.328062499162	The Koch Brothers have a very clear political agenda.
0.0	0.592492187046	In terms of Saudi Arabia, look, my biggest problem with them is they're funding radical clerics through their madrasses.
0.0	0.330314834311	And you had better get rid of them, because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.461904215418	That's what he talked about, the great threat of China.
0.0	0.166421530299	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.244235764362	Absolutely, we need to defund Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.427807911923	In fact, that's part of the problem.
0.0	0.405212839284	To repeal these unconstitutional illegal orders, whether it's amnesty or whether it's this president going around the Congress, whether it's in Obamacare, to restore the rule of law.
0.0	0.730243871949	I've heard them talk about deporting 10 or 11 -- people here from this country out of this country, splitting families.
0.0	0.307426774042	We're going to have people come in, but they're coming in legally.
0.0	0.427524950164	So you know the New York Times and I don't have exactly have the warmest of relationships.
0.0	0.234661695011	If that's a blind trust, I don't know.
0.0	0.237131053225	I'm just saying.
0.0	0.247455187394	You know, I think most people know exactly what New York values are.
0.0	0.467249290742	And it is a -- the kind of criticism that we've heard from Senator Sanders about our president I expect from Republicans.
0.0	0.625078316218	The result of that, you had the Iranian Revolution coming in, and that is where we are today.
0.0	0.688004501309	We have arrived at a point in our nation's history where the potential of this nation and too many Americans is being crushed by the weight, the power, the cost, the complexity, the ineptitude, the corruption of the federal government, and only someone who will challenge the status quo of Washington, D.C. can lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.452480364298	Secondly, a policy on recruiting and hiring, and then more resources for -- for training.
0.0	0.173829353206	We need to stop that.
0.0	0.166807227712	And, thank you everybody.
1.0	0.835996645799	They see more people in jail in the United States of America than any other country on earth, 2.2 million.
0.0	0.715169248298	What this campaign is not only about electing someone who has the most progressive agenda, it is about bringing tens of millions of people together to demand that we have a government that represents all of us and not just the 1 percent, who today have so much economic and political power.
0.0	0.491244016919	This is incredibly complicated, because we've got Iran as a big player, in addition to Russia.
0.0	0.290674508993	The fact of the matter is we're not going to have peace -- we are not going to have peace in Syria.
0.0	0.190201436164	And I have many great Muslim friends.
1.0	0.424426682614	And Iranian wise guys having guns to their heads.
0.0	0.645808748693	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.293064985406	Nobody can solve it like me.

0.0	0.308986668265	But judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.556375988866	There are a lot of training programs and education programs that I think can be streamlined and put into a much better format so that if we do continue them they can be more useful, in public schools, community colleges, and colleges and universities.

1.0	0.595709765165	You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don't agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements.
0.0	0.2123609336	...
0.0	0.835576046656	It was some of the most progressive members of the United States Congress who opposed it for that reason.

0.0	0.386971952592	That's not the role of the government.
0.0	0.417185831147	Never been done before, never been done since.
0.0	0.301997007159	We're against your policies.
0.0	0.51636805387	My tax plan enables you to fill out your taxes on a postcard so we can abolish the IRS.
0.0	0.372511747114	Let me -- let me answer your question on the Sun-Sentinel editorial today.
0.0	0.260609690187	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.472896651554	My four children have been able to receive a good Christian education, and I've been able to save for them to go to college so they never have to have the loans that I did.
0.0	0.382807289959	...I'm going to go to Washington to stop it...
0.0	0.655074111156	And I'll go back to something that had been mentioned just a few minutes ago.
0.0	0.696340277989	If you're a farmer, if you're a rancher, if you are small business owner, the death tax is gone.
0.0	0.598583880768	One of your colleagues interviewed me.
0.0	0.202396574728	I'm president -- look, I've done it once.
0.0	0.716441482393	I try to live by the rules, no matter what they are, and I was brought up that way as a kid.
0.0	0.695181871092	All of those things are important, and all those things would happen in a Christie administration.
1.0	0.269688056602	Believe me, that is why Ohio is doing well.
0.0	0.67892349062	Chris Christie wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.289093301413	And on this issue of the Medicare in particular, it's important because they're going to demagogue what we're saying here tonight.
0.0	0.412440024275	That's right, three pages.
0.0	0.700422118869	Planned Parenthood had better hope that Hillary Clinton wins this election, because I guarantee under President Jindal, January 2017, the Department of Justice and the IRS and everybody else that we can send from the federal government will be going in to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.735790887862	And I traveled the country and learned how people made jobs.
0.0	0.317463996116	So, I'm proud of Senator Sanders, and his supporters.
0.0	0.293052551357	And I also want to recognize the people in that church that showed the grace of God and the grace of forgiveness and the mercy that they showed.
0.0	0.223949575921	Somebody says "I'm a fighter."
0.0	0.162656582828	If people are promising they're going to take on Washington and cronyism, you need to look to who has been doing it.
0.0	0.39032864407	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.453625922008	We need a ground force in Iraq and Syria, and America has to be part of that ground force.
0.0	0.383769921481	But we stuck to our message.
0.0	0.607707387884	First, we should pass the Expatriate Terrorist Act, legislation I've introduced that says if an American goes and joins ISIS and wages jihad against America, that you forfeit your citizenship and you can not come in on a passport.
0.0	0.285957504456	I hope you will make a decision soon on this.
0.0	0.548155040944	OK. You know, you judge a nation not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how you treat, we treat, the most vulnerable and fragile people in our nation.
1.0	0.786092527421	You used to support a 500 percent increase in the number of guest workers, now you say that you're against it.
0.0	0.228958526535	But the leaders have come forward to realize that protest is fine, but violence is wrong.
0.0	0.277934262944	We're going to fight it as hard as we can, and we're going to fight whoever the Republicans nominate who will depend on the Koch Brothers, and others.
0.0	0.255387478842	So don't put people in there if you don't want them bombed.
0.0	0.331784050928	The matter is what orders exist now that shouldn't exist?
0.0	0.272092987974	I'm a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.446944937638	It turns out we knew something was wrong.
0.0	0.336266012451	We had Hamas.
0.0	0.181521456858	I think he would have been right.
0.0	0.23626539951	I mean, that's just the bottom line.
0.0	0.726231261812	I'll tell you this, the number one job of the president of the United States is to protect the safety and security of the American people.
0.0	0.857329517246	Every single time that there has been a Defense bill in the Senate, three people team up to vote against it.
0.0	0.689761572602	That's why we embraced individual liberty, and we became the freest people ever, and the result was the American miracle.
0.0	0.415855876525	We're not going to solve this problem with traditional politics.
0.0	0.280137113405	And what I have said is I will not throw us further into debt.
0.0	0.2123609336	...
0.0	0.223023887862	See?
0.0	0.237729178037	You don't have to.
1.0	0.671987876805	And in Libya, for example, the United States, Secretary Clinton, as secretary of state, working with some other countries, did get rid of a terrible dictator named Gadhafi.
0.0	0.211275841745	I mean, Chris will know about that.
0.0	0.295993119098	I know every one.
0.0	0.28211298339	It is Iran that's the expansionist power.
0.0	0.2289314687	Let me (inaudible).
0.0	0.488232507652	So what we do, though, is, if there is somebody who is price- gouging, we have laws for prosecutors to take that on.
0.0	0.321353853128	This is not some small scale group.
0.0	0.535452806575	If she gets elected, she's under investigation with the FBI right now.
0.0	0.21191138743	Our next president...
0.0	0.20115961859	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.179097751759	You know, that's so simple.
0.0	0.718137694681	I do not want to walk my five grandkids through the charred remains of a once great country called America, and say, "Here you go, $20 trillion dollars of debt.
0.0	0.25844549348	So, it's going to be my responsibility to make sure we move forward to solve these problems that are now out in the open.
0.0	0.629062388497	They have to have some legal basis and precedence for being able to follow the law instead of making the law up, and my goal is -- in appointing Supreme Court justices, would be to point -- to appoint justices who would follow the law.
0.0	0.393756949188	Well, let's go with three.
0.0	0.283176607938	They are employing themselves, they are potentially employing others.
0.0	0.271695859944	That will be my mission as president.
0.0	0.591881896716	When I was 21, my mom died.
0.0	0.227717190032	That's for sure.
0.0	0.419377415651	One thing I want to be clear about tonight.
0.0	0.31816145945	It's good to be with you.
0.0	0.352192752725	And if we can do that in Texas, that 12th largest economy in the world, we can do it in America.
0.0	0.53875467123	And I have the feeling you're going to find a lot of cost overruns there and a lot of waste and duplicative activities.
0.0	0.244222630154	That's my bill.
0.0	0.306738020329	We have Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view.
0.0	0.153164149701	I think you're --
0.0	0.719096291277	I'm the only person on this stage that actually was involved in the chief architect of balancing the Federal Budget.
0.0	0.233799258432	It is a complicated relationship.
0.0	0.220078272595	That's right.
0.0	0.5	Because I think we have to get to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.403436577243	ISIL is trying to create themselves into a new state.
0.0	0.330238603423	And unlike President Obama, where he refuses even to use the term of what's going on, he can't use the term for whatever reason.
0.0	0.31286239325	I am a conservative because I know our values, our principles and our policies --
0.0	0.293465027298	I am a 2nd amendment person.
0.0	0.417532559403	It's going to happen in this country, there are going to be further attacks.
0.0	0.207251516587	We need a unifier, not a cynical divider in chief, and that's exactly what I will do.
0.0	0.457903225458	We have to lead a coalition that will take back territory from ISIS.
0.0	0.219530620632	You bet they do.
0.0	0.730907307082	So what we have tried to do and what President Obama succeeded in doing was to build on the health care system we have, get us to 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.352528981289	Everybody's record's going to be scrutinized, and at the end of the day we need to unite behind the winner so we can defeat Hillary Clinton, because she is a disaster.
0.0	0.225366456809	I've laid out...
0.0	0.22828156646	And, let me now on Social Security because we were getting into a good substantive exchange, and I want to say I think both Chris, and Mike are right.
0.0	0.661448644949	And that's the reason that I've said under my presidency, we'll create jobs and make American the number one manufacturing country in the world.
0.0	0.559173120917	On the issue of Barack Obama, Barack Obama does not believe that America is a great global power.
0.0	0.226408392152	This isn't free money.
0.0	0.652911134768	If we elect Hillary Clinton, the next four years will be worse than the last eight, and our children will be the first Americans ever to inherit a diminished country.
0.0	0.453114129084	They shouldn't automatically assume that because you believe that marriage is between one man and one woman that you are a homophobe.
0.0	0.620824910663	And the reason is simple: because in 2008, we elected as president someone who wasn't interested in fixing America.
0.0	0.14037866694	But also, I can't fake anger.
0.0	0.391497277586	And the reasons why I've done is I don't believe we have a good process of being able to vet them.
0.0	0.294649901872	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.34334496398	If I become President because we'll have a Constitutional Amendment to require a federally balanced budget so they will do their job.
0.0	0.330441885764	We're going dark when it comes to detecting the next attack.
0.0	0.489858287298	For example, before you hire anyone from abroad, you should have to advertise that job for 180 days.
0.0	0.75509154537	We have seniors out there who are scared to death because this Congress -- this one that we have right now, just stole $150 billion from the Social Security retirement fund to give it to the Social Security disability fund.
0.0	0.443550052402	I think there is constitutional and legal authority for the president to have done what he did.
0.0	0.244268224333	It is why we have to simplify.
0.0	0.343068716555	We need to rebuild our military, and this president has let it diminish to a point where tinpot dictators like the mullahs in Iran are taking our Navy ships.
0.0	0.49495028004	... in addition to that, we go ahead and we take the oil from them, their source of revenue.
0.0	0.527064023501	Heck, find me a Republican in Congress that would cut spending ten dollars.
0.0	0.351419850469	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.393184174857	Those aren't Iowa values, but this is what we believe in New York."
0.0	0.515193362826	We were behind where we were today.
0.0	0.223482799789	Thank you.
0.0	0.294643237144	I will do that in Washington.
0.0	0.57392426928	You know, a lot of business activity in America is conducted like the guy that does my dry cleaning.
0.0	0.755612647994	I've got the backbone, I've got the band width, I've got the experience to get us through this.
0.0	0.651680885424	We need to elect someone who will stand with the American people, who understands its greatness, who understands what an open economy and freedom is all about, but at the same time, has a record of being able to get things done in Washington like we've never seen before.
0.0	0.287173916232	That's what I'm working towards.
0.0	0.243986507063	Maybe you haven't.
0.0	0.351199240649	And if you can't use the term, you're never going to solve the problem.
0.0	0.225510084169	Here's the problem.
1.0	0.710837654379	Americans haven't had a raise in 15 years.
0.0	0.189579518229	...Chris...
0.0	0.223782794824	No.
0.0	0.391309682293	You know, she only had a third-grade education, but -- you know, she knew how to stretch a dollar.
0.0	0.556495374108	And you combine that with a plan to make manufacturing -- this country number one in manufacturing, you've got someone who's going to help revitalize and give hope to America, the place -- the place is that is the most hopeless today.
0.0	0.220885639821	Now, we're going to blame the people.
0.0	0.831105494943	I was one of the original sponsors of the DREAM Act.
0.0	0.360457065974	Do people not care about all of our sacrifice?
0.0	0.310327931535	It's why you see the banks consolidating.
0.0	0.607588129575	Last I heard we lived in a democratic society.
0.0	0.139485256556	So we need new leadership -- yes.
0.0	0.624849841218	... Of course there will be a limit, but when today you have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, when the middle class is disappearing, you have the highest rate of child poverty of almost any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.226416426136	Big difference.
0.0	0.333002513328	I got that.
0.0	0.580730040119	Well, if that's the case, we're going to win every state, if Bernie Sanders is the nominee.
0.0	0.174827673531	They will -- some will follow.
0.0	0.365686124079	And this is one of the myths that the left perpetrates on our society, and this is how they frighten people and get people to shut up.
0.0	0.247717489652	Creativity.
0.0	0.342612849236	And people said "you can't win, you can't change the culture."
0.0	0.511399726842	It's "give me options on how I can make it harder for law-abiding people to buy guns."
0.0	0.183135930847	I want security.
0.0	0.185888891625	But I think to suggest that I have voiced criticism, this blurb that you talk about, you know what the blurb said?
0.0	0.196077432713	So here's this -- the situation, I think, Maria.
0.0	0.494837807215	And I have to tell you, that was a very insulting statement that Ted made.
0.0	0.284513168832	You know, I see a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist.
0.0	0.339471730459	My name was mentioned.
0.0	0.584605507544	They said they would repeal Obamacare if we gave them the majority.
0.0	0.397779358483	You know, every election we hear a lot of talk.
0.0	0.195880461819	This will end.
0.0	0.515312627098	You sit down and you work with people, you make demands of people, in this case demanding Iran stop the support of international terrorism.
0.0	0.514598069507	... you're not going to have peace in Syria with Assad in charge.
1.0	0.543188661909	Let's not have the most expensive business tax rate in the world.
0.0	0.321071449676	That's what I said.
0.0	0.223482799789	Thank you.
0.0	0.216067990205	It will be a long day.
0.0	0.734004348465	Every time he's got a chance, going all the way back to -- remember that Great Beer Summit he had after he messed up that time.
0.0	0.68967747384	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.300021871617	Now, what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next.
0.0	0.425920066084	I want to talk to the folks at home.
0.0	0.764778499578	And if I misrepresented those results or those projections in any way, I was held criminally liable.
0.0	0.448123089995	This is the only time I've had a chance, let me finish.
0.0	0.223782794824	No.
0.0	0.723033542893	But the greatest gains, percentage-wise, for people, are gonna be at the lower end of our plan, and here's why: because in addition to a general personal exemption, we are increasing the per-child tax credit for working families.
0.0	0.262725860669	That makes the world less peaceful, less safe.
0.0	0.261840973439	Divisive and with no vision.
0.0	0.242278431256	And we are not England.
0.0	0.546160058293	Yes, we've lied to the American people about Social Security, and Medicare.
0.0	0.353862961504	I never said that.
0.0	0.430611681851	But my wife is down here in the front, and I'm sure, if you'd like to talk to her later, she can give you more than you'll ever be able to take care of.
0.0	0.327541042015	Over time, we're going to become energy independent.
0.0	0.220080676438	How great is that?
0.0	0.347082110938	We are lowering taxes on small business.
0.0	0.30685472712	... they don't like the Wall Street Journal.
0.0	0.687146507617	And that's why I've offered a specific program to the people of America tonight to address the fundamental problem of getting our country growing again, getting our economy growing, wages up, opportunities for people.
0.0	0.368461481372	I don't know if people understand, but I spent a lifetime with my colleagues getting us to a federal balanced budget.
0.0	0.449206475624	And the fact is those jobs are critical, they're hard working members of the middle class and they need to be paid attention to because they're Americans and they carry the load.
0.0	0.469750143186	Trying to get Iran and Saudi Arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter.
0.0	0.5	Obama broke every rule of negotiation.
0.0	0.268471218369	I am a little skeptical about your governor actually caring enough about higher education to make any kind of commitment like that.
0.0	0.476132168623	Let me tell you what I would do immediately, day two in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.542167414684	We call that the American Dream, although, it's built on the universal dream of a better life.
0.0	0.813943158459	It comes from the right, from the left, from people on all sides of the political spectrum.
0.0	0.276375559449	Not the change we need at a time we need it.
0.0	0.548759570748	Truth is that far more blacks get stopped for traffic violations.
0.0	0.385728158104	We need to use our technological advantages, because what we've warned of is an international guerrilla movement that threatens this country.
0.0	0.5	We honest to god are here to get this country back on track.
0.0	0.150431626896	See, they don't like that.
0.0	0.304136553665	No, you did.
0.0	0.678290378985	But it was not on a second filing with FDIC and yes, I made a paperwork error disclosing it on one piece of paper instead of the other.
0.0	0.27684634224	The most mistreated people.
0.0	0.292731786151	It can not be someone that agrees with his agenda.
0.0	0.280485157722	But I think this is a worldwide -- that the entire world needs to come together to deal with this horrific refugee crisis we're seeing from Syria and Afghanistan, as well.
0.0	0.587506819921	If there's an act of violence in America, his immediate answer before he even knows the facts is gun control.
0.0	0.221081276877	I'm aware of that.
0.0	0.657571594773	Because they're recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees.
0.0	0.471690774701	This was a question on entitlements.
0.0	0.505272714919	And that free education of extraordinary accomplishment was from first grade to 12th grade.
0.0	0.793897083065	And we fought for statewide school choice, where the dollars follow the child, instead of the child following the dollars.
0.0	0.5	And the problem today is there's no confidence in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.225277053928	I can.
0.0	0.630106512996	I've set forth very specific plans about how to get costs down, especially prescription drug costs.
0.0	0.403611787833	We need someone with a steady hand being president of the United States.
0.0	0.602579444913	It just needs a corporate executive type at the top that's done it before.
0.0	0.224007874526	He undermines it.
0.0	0.398502124681	We have a $19 trillion bipartisan debt and it continues to grow as we borrow money from countries that do not like us to pay for government we cannot afford.
0.0	0.236714104079	This country is changing.
0.0	0.63511821129	It worked for Reagan and it works for our team in Ohio.

0.0	0.314800405528	Carl, are we really talking about getting government involved in fantasy football?
0.0	0.701300775172	And when it comes to the issues that are really on the front lines as to whether we're going to have equal pay, paid family leave, some opportunity for, you know, women to go as far as their hard work and talent take them, I think that we still have some barriers to knock down, which is why that's at the core of my campaign.

0.0	0.562747680686	We both believe there has to be more money going into the Social Security system.
0.0	0.233968495506	I'm not blaming Chris, by the way, but he will know about that.
0.0	0.217500664363	You know why?
0.0	0.351622327909	We now have some good models about how better to provide employment, housing and education.
0.0	0.546007597603	I laid out a plan at the Citadel to do just that and it starts with creating a "No Fly Zone" and "Safe Zones" to make sure refugees are there.

0.0	0.827134902227	Now, I for seven years was the U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.

0.0	0.240856676957	Let me tell you how that question...

0.0	0.209328843444	He's wrong.

0.0	0.575249244651	We have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9/11, and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks, yet we see the terrible attack in San Bernardino and know that we haven't done enough.
0.0	0.218919024373	You know, you look at what's going on, you see all the divisiveness and the hatred that goes on in our society.
0.0	0.334228148261	I got the briefings.

0.0	0.487653037239	I am, but people are upset, and they're upset for a reason about the future of this country.
0.0	0.170183142814	And finally, on health care, why don't we start treating -- keep giving...
0.0	0.185152760519	CRUZL But I will say --
0.0	0.740104744113	13 Hours -- tomorrow morning, a new movie will debut about the incredible bravery of the men fighting for their lives in Benghazi and the politicians that abandoned them.
0.0	0.224452545254	The answer is no.
0.0	0.302066102644	Well, let me -- let me first of all talk a little bit about my experience.
0.0	0.583679426548	I believe that we need to cut these taxes down, we need to be on a roadmap to balancing the budget, and we need to send power, money, and influence, the welfare department, the education department, job training, infrastructure, Medicaid, all of that out of Washington back to the states so we can run these programs from where we live to the top, not a one size fits all mentality that they have in Washington.
0.0	0.18354514873	I think he is right.
0.0	0.468673455818	It turns out some dot wasn't connected, and so the first thing we have to do is make sure that everyone and every responsible agency is attuned to all of these possibilities and symptoms.
0.0	0.516870279815	I have seen him appoint people to our courts not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.42351832131	Since he has changed his mind on amnesty, on health care and on abortion, I would just ask, what are the principles by which he will govern?
0.0	0.516682389956	In fact, I was all for you until you started doing that, because that's a misrepresentation, number one.
0.0	0.289600154234	Japan, the same thing.

0.0	0.276362392391	You've got to keep asking.
0.0	0.627444452979	Yes, does Wall Street and big financial interests, along with drug companies, insurance companies, big oil, all of it, have too much influence?
0.0	0.354215672057	It was a hard choice.
0.0	0.398073175379	... stirs up the demagoguery against American Muslims, that hurts us at home.
0.0	0.306207597344	When we do business with China, they tax us.
0.0	0.38724788815	I was not that candidate.
0.0	0.250937820292	Alright.
0.0	0.549071047683	But a great nation like ours should not be in a position where elderly people are cutting their pills in half, where they don't have decent nutrition, where they can't heat their homes in the wintertime.
0.0	0.659006430728	If we want to create jobs for the folks that you're talking about, who are having trouble getting off government benefits, primarily because of their low skill level, there is no better way -- it's worked for 100 years in America -- putting people back to work in manufacturing is it.
0.0	0.517046127279	You know, before it was called Obamacare, it was called Hillarycare.
0.0	0.274876291506	I have Ivanka, and Eric and Don sitting there.
0.0	0.536577381083	Well, first of all the -- the plan gives people the option of -- of opting out.
0.0	0.309639701952	I will run on my record all day long.
0.0	0.285350369875	Well, it's an interesting question because I'm very proud of my company.
0.0	0.316679264273	I may not be your dream candidate just yet, but I can assure you I am Hillary Clinton's worst nightmare.
0.0	0.527373372778	Bernie Sanders, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.
0.0	0.342827789917	Secretary Clinton, I do have a disagreement here.
0.0	0.406256783522	And let me tell you, ISIS and terrorists do not get their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.717840782142	I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators -- back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.
0.0	0.682122007056	What I said, and let me repeat it, I don't know what economists Secretary Clinton is talking to, but what I have said, and let me repeat it, that yes, the middle -- the family right in the middle of the economy would pay $500 dollars more in taxes, and get a reduction in their healthcare costs of $5,000 dollars.
0.0	0.266161096199	You see, folks, this is how socialism starts.
0.0	0.321038724874	Of course not.
0.0	0.353734003855	Now, you can support one now that's very low.
0.0	0.42710718982	You cannot make rash statements and expect the rest of the world to respond as though, well, it's just politics.
0.0	0.492025693803	Judy, if I can, there is no question, Secretary Clinton and I are friends, and I have a lot of respect for her, that she has enormous experience in foreign affairs.

0.0	0.450889684289	There is no money in the Medicare account.
0.0	0.697322897799	But view is those trade policies have enabled corporate America to shut down in this country, throw millions of people out on the street.

0.0	0.671257627283	In this particular moment of serious crises, saying to the American people don't give up on the political process.
0.0	0.416980835928	I believe that we have got to move toward a path toward citizenship.
0.0	0.420795373924	They like General Motors, so they give them a pass.

0.0	0.235028072939	I will stand firm.
0.0	0.582994995047	My program would move the 104 programs of the federal Department of Education into four block grants, and send them back to the states because income inequality is driven by a lack of skills when kids don't get what they need to be able to compete and win in this country.
0.0	0.210411699161	And meanwhile, small businesses are getting crushed.
0.0	0.434885681521	He has got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...

1.0	0.475506457049	I didn't have an involvement with them.
0.0	0.438495649287	And as Reagan demonstrated, if we cut taxes, we can bring back growth.
0.0	0.272542741005	Too often, they give up, they negotiate with themselves.
0.0	0.479664303923	One principle, for example, we've got to embrace is on immigration.
0.0	0.298173164024	This is 2016.
0.0	0.279811940807	Are you coming onboard a proposal?
0.0	0.196426196366	But the key thing that we're seeing now is serious challenges to this country that must change, the direction of this nation must change.

0.0	0.317198542326	You spend the money today and then you hope you're going to save money tomorrow.
0.0	0.231112001528	We have no borders.
0.0	0.322203628051	We need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources, but from sources overseas, that can be a real-time fusion effort to get information where it's needed.
0.0	0.263168911854	And make sure you enhance savings in the private market.
0.0	0.295822634524	No, not at all, absolutely not.
0.0	0.388590926737	You have to reform Social Security, and the simple way to do it is to make sure that the wealthiest don't receive the same benefits as people that are lower-income.
0.0	0.283963122219	So we need 1,000.
0.0	0.220804862501	So I'm doing great.
0.0	0.304830550477	They go to Harvard.
0.0	0.274915062926	They believe some are smarter than others, some are better than others, so some are going to need to take care of others.
0.0	0.437040226005	I want to speak to all of those maddened by political correctness, where Hillary Clinton apologizes for saying all lives matter.
0.0	0.5	That is a dramatic tax decrease for hard-working people who run their own businesses.
0.0	0.564162851732	You know, Obama has presented the American people with a false choice every time.
0.0	0.734212271187	But here's the best way that we're going to make America much more exceptional: it is to make sure we put someone on that stage in September who will fight Hillary Clinton and make sure she never, ever gets in the White House again.
0.0	0.265414931791	I'm interested in making sure we get the maximum amount of revenue from those who can well afford to provide it.
0.0	0.704465445531	The billionaire and the working man, no hedge fund manager pays less than his secretary.
0.0	0.250132776582	I'm never going to change my tune.
0.0	0.18402002401	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.243331639827	And not just green cards.
0.0	0.388645182902	I far prefer that and the chances we have to be successful there than trying to start all over again, gridlocking our system, and trying to get from zero to 100 percent.
0.0	0.764984526136	After the war we had all of these kids, Baby Boomers.
0.0	0.7222176912	Well, first of all, like many other very big businessmen, I could name them here, but I'm not going to do that for a lot of obvious reasons, but the biggest, and almost all of them, they've all used the chapter laws, the bankruptcy laws to their own benefit.
0.0	0.258941722082	We are not France.
0.0	0.285319290131	The world has changed.
0.0	0.506380551538	But in 2008, we elected a president that didn't want to fix America.
0.0	0.662126380658	Yes, the wealthiest people, the top 1.5 percent, will pay more in taxes.
0.0	0.564477433597	In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense.
0.0	0.566931272511	And we can take that message and that formula to Washington to lift every single American to a better life.
0.0	0.248694272607	We have Dodd-Frank.
0.0	0.649447916012	Barack Obama got his massive tax increase, and there was no spending cuts.
0.0	0.691756996353	Well, I believe that there are abuses, those companies should be permanently barred from ever using the program again and we should put strict standards in place to ensure that they're not being abused, like the prevailing wage requirement and like the advertising requirement.
0.0	0.466624080993	But we allowed people to keep health care.
0.0	0.250214373464	You're simply not.
0.0	0.485246158352	And there's a bunch of things my tax plan does to help them.
0.0	0.569640868622	We elected a president that is weakening America on the global stage.
1.0	0.898966312029	Later that year, in 2004, John Kerry ran for president missing close to 60 to 70 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.286746469498	We hear actually a lot of good intentions.
0.0	0.177453387874	It should be what are your substantive positions...
1.0	0.567221623098	The bad news is, we have 470,000 going out of business every year.
0.0	0.603091286437	I've had more calls on that statement that Ted made -- New York is a great place.
0.0	0.581779565978	And in fact, in Obama administration, we did not meet with anybody without conditions.
0.0	0.330396548126	What -- what -- you're from New York?
0.0	0.148381419399	All we need to do is protect them, they will be in their own country.
0.0	0.796527142593	The Democrats' answer to everything is more government control over wages, and more empowering trial lawyers to file lawsuits.
0.0	0.311529410486	Reforming entitlements, cutting taxes.
0.0	0.651617288834	We have to end crony capitalism in Washington, where the lobbyists and the powerful can get tax breaks and tax credits, and the American people don't get laws in their interest.
0.0	0.233789090576	We haven't.
0.0	0.363519315136	They're sick of politics as usual.
0.0	0.508320183984	Well, first of all, I'm 7 and 0 in my fantasy league.
0.0	0.192822839597	And we need to bring our debt under control, make our economy stronger.
0.0	0.307842266979	We're going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education.
0.0	0.216841322277	A rich person does not.
0.0	0.705855028848	And I would note the other individuals on this stage were nowhere to be found in that fight.
0.0	0.34734377929	How do we utilize our intellect rather than allowing the government to use its, quote, "intellect," in order to help us to be able to live healthier and better lives?
0.0	0.600653876743	So let's support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition.
0.0	0.484080368123	They are the ones who should respond to any questions.
0.0	0.295254271176	It has to be dealt with.
0.0	0.569955288924	Because we work with the private sector to make solar energy affordable and available to businesses and individuals in our state.
0.0	0.203361308375	You know, America doesn't owe me anything.
0.0	0.225882043482	No, he doesn't.
0.0	0.245824639923	We need a president who can solve our problems, bring us together.
0.0	0.630887763215	Not all of his top national security advisors agreed with that.
0.0	0.464332682392	And, we have a government and leaders in government that are completely out of touch, and that's why I'm running for president.
0.0	0.555885179666	Now, when it mattered, he stood up and took on Wall Street.
0.0	0.296926174231	We need a fighter for this country again.
0.0	0.375084399246	There is no money, it's a stack of paper.
0.0	0.483818546158	... on the issue of citizenship, Donald, I'm not going to use your mother's birth against you.
0.0	0.529510259563	... you had two 110-story buildings come crashing down.
0.0	0.790576198828	When CEO income has risen 90 percent above the average worker, when the bottom 90 percent of this country's economy has had stagnant wages for the past 40 years, somebody is taking it in the teeth.
0.0	0.216392046966	You have to ban radical Islamic jihadists.
0.0	0.30238200022	We have to shut down their internet capability.
0.0	0.205415982767	I would like to start with a basic.
0.0	0.362862736065	First, rather than expand benefits for everyone, I do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs.
0.0	0.433920932472	I mean, literally, the Senate -- what is it, like a French work week?
0.0	0.0844523520892	And I could say, oh, I'm not angry.
0.0	0.227670589192	Say again?
0.0	0.5	So I think the better approach, the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against China economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage Barack Obama is doing to this economy.
0.0	0.294838194797	But I would probably have my children run it with my executives and I wouldn't ever be involved because I wouldn't care about anything but our country, anything.
0.0	0.346855338358	You've got to bring people together.
0.0	0.697591951652	And by the way, as important as those two phone calls are, they are also very important because they say this.
0.0	0.464333598777	At that particular point in time, then Americans will believe that Washington is up to a conversation to deal with the millions of people that are here illegally, but not until.
1.0	0.815512701862	We're sitting up here talking about all these other things; 71 percent of federal spending today is on entitlements, and debt service.
0.0	0.150533632865	... he's really doing some bad...
1.0	0.682812663309	Look, I have an A plus rating in the NRA and we also have a reduction in gun violence because in Florida, if you commit a crime with a gun, you're going away.
0.0	0.710883465083	That debate reflected a debate between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks.
0.0	0.340657256932	And I think Ted Kennedy had a very clear idea about what needed to be done.
0.0	0.366405179603	We have to support the fighters on the ground, principally the Arabs and the Kurds who are willing to stand up and take territory back from Raqqa to Ramadi.
0.0	0.353385953384	You can't grow your way out of demographics.
0.0	0.647752147932	They discussed how -- how hard it is to sell tractors in China, because all the regulatory barriers.
0.0	0.247799983972	And I'm going to tell you, that it -- I'm going to suggest to you here tonight, that you can't do on the job training.
0.0	0.171024644544	Unless you are clinically insane...
0.0	0.284846582389	And, people are sick of believing that the government is never going to really address this.
0.0	0.603677379155	Those three things put together are going to give confidence to job creators and you will begin to see wages rise.
0.0	0.464006578992	Crony capitalism is alive and well, and has been so in Washington, D.C. for decades.
0.0	0.582410472474	And it is now being put into place everyplace across the state of Ohio.
1.0	0.741968537594	And I know this, because when I ran for governor of New York, one in 11 of every man, woman, and child in the state of New York was on welfare.
0.0	0.465141874355	I'm very proud that NARAL endorsed me because when it comes to it we need a leader on women's issues.
0.0	0.83847399915	I didn't get a phone call from Bill Clinton before I jumped in the race.
0.0	0.599143069415	The question was, would you meet with an adversary without conditions?
0.0	0.307307429436	But the poll numbers have.

0.0	0.251347245549	No accomplishment.
0.0	0.196370830579	It's not only offensive; it's dangerous.
0.0	0.255592958207	Obamacare, we're going to repeal it and replace it.
0.0	0.535448287127	There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies.

0.0	0.29862282738	Ben Carson, can you do math?
0.0	0.591969669813	The better way of dealing with this -- the better way of dealing with this is recognizing that there are people in, you know, the -- Islamic terrorists inside, embedded in refugee populations.
0.0	0.162340363463	But we need to understand that American Muslims are on the front line of our defense.
0.0	0.605372285096	First of all, John got lucky with a thing called fracking, OK?
0.0	0.261000956128	I've done it.

0.0	0.160066123875	Maria, I'd just like to say...
0.0	0.54452274668	I am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of Vermont from very significant majorities of women.

1.0	0.780021021109	And I've done it when I was in Washington when we had a balanced budget; had four years of balanced budgets; paid down a half-trillion of debt.
0.0	0.22635820961	You know that.
0.0	0.700924228989	We can save and preserve and strengthen Social Security by making no changes for seniors, but for younger workers gradually increasing the retirement age, changing the rate of growth so that it matches inflation, and critically allowing younger workers to keep a portion of our tax payments in a personal account that we own, we control them, we can pass on to our kids.
0.0	0.485223168659	The simple fact is that the plane that's being build here is being sold to China.

1.0	0.720400766196	I've used it three times, maybe four times.
0.0	0.466469721176	I'm going to get a response to that, Neil.

0.0	0.231515978071	I'm ready.
0.0	0.247997703704	They're a scam.
0.0	0.334445203205	Judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.662723426402	Both Democrats and Republicans have gotten us in the mess we're in -- $18 trillion of debt, a bad deal with Iran, we're not staying with Israel.
0.0	0.430861129553	I've watched to see people say that we should dismantle Medicare and Medicaid and leave the senior citizens out -- out in the -- in the cold.
0.0	0.637209798335	The government is not supposed to be in every part of our lives, and that is what is causing the problem.
0.0	0.446857344473	The cybersecurity challenges that we face, this administration failed us completely, completely.
0.0	0.654307095737	Well, and specifically to Medicare, Becky, because 85 percent of the cost of Medicare is chronic disease.
0.0	0.66346533367	You look at the kind of damage that two people that two people that got married, they were radicalized -- they got married, they killed 15 people in actually 15 -- going to be probably 16 but you look at that and you take a look -- a good strong look and that's what we have.
0.0	0.433578189684	Well, look, I think that she's been saying that for as long as I've known her, which is about 25 years.
0.0	0.647869011199	Why, for the life of me, I do not understand why did we stop doing vocational education in America, people that can work with their hands; people you can train to do this work while they're still in high school so they can graduate ready to go work.
0.0	0.582663816476	You know, I know to a lot of people in the media, this is just a great big game, and we're the players.
0.0	0.423381467847	The most powerful intelligence agency in the world is going to tell us where we are, the most powerful military in the world is going to destroy them.
0.0	0.47581556263	That is principally an American-led air campaign that we are now engaged in.
0.0	0.382648356259	But that's not an accurate description of the plan.
0.0	0.28968299014	Maria, Neil, thank you for a great debate tonight.
0.0	0.692629400118	And I will suggest to you nobody's done it like Rick Perry has done it over the last eight years.
0.0	0.217328890028	I suspect you may have.
0.0	0.330581954871	...10% flat rate...
0.0	0.291454298399	I am against the raids.
1.0	0.594275423398	The government stole it, and spent it a long time ago...
0.0	0.238776957274	I think he's tapped into an anger that people feel.
0.0	0.318614076359	And I appreciate greatly Senator Sanders' voting record.
0.0	0.283177279229	Where are you gonna clean it up?
0.0	0.406300914581	They were paid speeches.
0.0	0.253355873588	So we need to get on a different mindset.
0.0	0.740342652516	I think what President Obama did was to exemplify the importance of this issue as our first African American president, and to address it both from the President's office, and through his advocacy, such as working with young men, and Mrs. Obama's work with young women.
0.0	0.116405841942	I think we should be for free trade but I think fair trade.
0.0	0.642756912215	You think about it -- this is the president who said, along with his secretary of state -- drew a red line in Syria, said, if Assad uses chemical weapons against his people, that we're going to attack.
0.0	0.779061555757	I wanna tell you, in my state, we took Medicaid, the hardest program to control, and we took it from a 10 percent growth rate to 2.5 percent without taking one person off the rolls or cutting one single benefit.
0.0	0.323074179084	I have a slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially.
0.0	0.618400881361	We need to make the government run smarter and better, and reform this corporate tax system, bring that money back to the United States to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, and we need to use it also to protect our grid from terrorists.
0.0	0.303937532104	Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.549858979362	So count me in as somebody who will not be listening to Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.21475294269	I'm too trusting.
0.0	0.393615319419	It is why we have to reduce the size and power of government.
0.0	0.192845486228	Let me just -- just say this.
0.0	0.785389890271	And now after seven years of your policies, we have the biggest majority we've had since the 1920s in the House; a Republican majority in the Senate; and 31 out of 50 Republican governors.
0.0	0.865186664253	I have a proven record of success, 32 years in business, and 8 years as Governor of the state of Florida.
0.0	0.667463798427	Everytime they got a paycheck, the government reached in and took something out of it before they ever saw it.
0.0	0.766284735161	I would just say, I debated then Senator Obama numerous times on stages like this, and he was the recipient of the largest number of Wall Street donations of anybody running on the Democratic side ever.
0.0	0.291095493658	But we can give people better health care.
0.0	0.318750756756	And you can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.610410664733	... you know, the -- the -- the fact of the matter is -- you know, if we fix the taxation system, make it absolutely fair, and get rid of the incredible regulations -- because every regulation is a tax, it's a -- on goods and services.
0.0	0.493774118029	I do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination to succeed President Obama.
0.0	0.317193994683	But in addition to that, we have to have fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.564805180506	So we have no disagreement about the need to buttress Social Security, get more revenue into the program.
0.0	0.814452258261	Results count, and as governor, I pushed Florida up to the top in terms of jobs, income and small business growth.
0.0	0.370042955769	I'm proud that I gave him that advice.
0.0	0.356797023428	Hey, I'm in the United States Senate, and anyone who doesn't think that there is an enormous amount of waste and inefficiency and bureaucracy throughout government would be very, very mistaken.
0.0	0.579867003551	If elected president, I will do everything I can to expand Social Security benefits, not just for seniors, but for disabled veterans, as well.
0.0	0.790457713643	We've got 11 million undocumented people in this country.
1.0	0.417028026378	I have vetoed a reduction this clip size.
0.0	0.407287379897	Our legal immigration system from now on has to be merit-based.
0.0	0.262636200083	Yeah, they are unhinged.
0.0	0.742915377521	I have worked with President Obama for the last seven years.
0.0	0.578693281133	Nine months ago, our campaign began.
0.0	0.132084783516	They don't like NBC, but I like the poll.
0.0	0.556722075594	So, I would pass legislation outlawing abortion after 20 weeks.
1.0	0.776148216302	In fact, the largest after- tax gains is for the people at the lower end of the tax spectrum under my plan.
0.0	0.573771014838	That was before he was running against me.
0.0	0.180187826299	And -- and I guess I can -- can frame it another way.
0.0	0.290162012207	Makes it a whole lot easier for them to want to go somewhere else.
0.0	0.241396544937	Why?
0.0	0.299295507201	I propose to reverse that and get this economy moving again.
0.0	0.333126164032	I have a bill to fix Medicare.
0.0	0.522274131882	How about talking about the substantive issues the people care about?
0.0	0.414411945096	And, when I hear people talking about means testing, let's just remember what that means.
0.0	0.184459358219	And so it was (inaudible) his statement, which is why I'm asking him to consider changing his views.
0.0	0.17907912096	We need to reverse that.
0.0	0.189423874691	I know personally how extraordinary and unique this nation is.
0.0	0.404573418617	I am the man who can bring us together to do that, and I ask for your vote.
0.0	0.305735054603	We could do a whole show on that.
0.0	0.528672499834	I'm against the kind of inhumane treatment that is now being visited upon families, waking them up in the middle of the night, rounding them up.
0.0	0.318635198084	When -- when we put all the facts down, you'll be able to see that it's not true, it works out very well.
0.0	0.454072541802	These mythical Arab armies that my friends talk about that are going to protect us don't exist.
0.0	0.241348403078	No, absolutely not.
0.0	0.132386172318	You see, because if you really want to get to a balanced budget, you need to reduce your expenses and you need to grow your economy.
0.0	0.281140816398	Yesterday, the president stunningly admitted this.
0.0	0.268085365091	We have to put more money.
0.0	0.617275816746	I used the laws of the country to my benefit, I'm sorry.
0.0	0.446570073495	I think the last eight years in the private sector have allowed me to see government from the outside, and I think that is a positive thing.
0.0	0.756058438853	He was overthrown by British and American interests because he threatened oil interests of the British.
0.0	0.657267488249	We own a home four blocks away from the place that I grew up in.
0.0	0.427180709372	I want to tackle those barriers that stand in the way of too many Americans right now.
0.0	0.32034517097	And -- and -- and I -- you know, Ben is absolutely right in saying that what we don't need to do is to send more money to Washington, D.C. to fix this problem.
0.0	0.272495887378	Came out great.
0.0	0.452549526561	You have to ban the people who are trying to hurt us.
0.0	0.302772329295	Take it to the bank.
0.0	0.346230765414	And let's not let the secular progressives drive that out of us.
0.0	0.487351723823	China doesn't pay the tariff, the buyer pays the tariff.
0.0	0.651519848223	I will cut this government down to size and hold it accountable, simplify the tax code, roll back the regulations that have been spewing out of Washington, D.C. for 50 years.
1.0	0.790059971202	It is a simple flat tax where for individuals, a family of four pays nothing on the first $36,000.
0.0	0.568198160613	I'm in favor of people coming into this country legally.
0.0	0.463438150486	But like all of our problems, there isn't a single one that can't be solved with common sense if you remove the ego and the politics.
0.0	0.810986855983	I put together the coalition that imposed the sanctions on Iran that got us to the negotiating table to put a lid on their nuclear weapons program.
0.0	0.34988811968	It's harder to talk to your enemies.
0.0	0.37910393196	We'd rebuild infrastructure that would also create jobs in this country, and we'd work with the states to do it the right way, to do it more efficiently and more effectively.
0.0	0.5	She wouldn't just be a disaster, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being commander in chief of the United States.
0.0	0.269513511045	Let's allow companies to immediately expense.
0.0	0.762650351288	If you listen to the State of the Union the other night, he described them as a bunch of guys with long beards on the back of a pickup truck.
0.0	0.441760833331	And now we have to accept 2 percent, the new normal for economic growth.
0.0	0.211775652637	Now, let me just be clear, John.
0.0	0.665747080447	When I am president of the United States, I'm going to side with Ronald Regan on this and not Nancy Pelosi and we are not having a vat tax.
0.0	0.364507240271	That's gonna be the real growth engine.
0.0	0.675014683353	He needs to recognize that those kinds of things are in fact an existential threat to us.
0.0	0.694783054681	My father was born in Italy, and shortly after he was born my grandfather immigrated to this country.
0.0	0.834074322512	It was LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations in this country.
0.0	0.668057228528	I would take the fight to these guys, whatever it took, as long as it took.
0.0	0.125979802056	Our decision is, then, do we give them what we need.
0.0	0.384076678803	A lot of interesting issues have come together.
0.0	0.561429008223	This is a country that is of, for and by the people.
0.0	0.247836014158	Because that's what we'd get if it were Jeb -- I tell you what, we don't need that.
0.0	0.566012499628	But the issue for us is to have a Congress that stands up and says not only no, but "Hell no" to this money going to a regime that is going to use it for terror, Susan Rice has said that, and we need to stand up and strongly and clearly tell the ayatollah that -- whoever the next president of the United States is going to be, and I'll promise you, if it's me, the first thing that I will do is tear up that agreement with Iran.
0.0	0.721211414839	I started the Gang of Seven, and it led to the overtaking of the 40-year Democratic rule of Congress, because I didn't -- I stood up to the old-boy network in Washington, D.C. because I believed that Washington was not the solution, that Washington was the problem, just like Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.286237877324	We have a -- they say there's no bipartisanship in Washington?
0.0	0.448382384909	We're gutting our military, and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were.
0.0	0.317801085626	Well, I did.
0.0	0.247219539342	It ain't going to happen.
0.0	0.599478178971	And I've done it in the state of Ohio as the chief executive.
0.0	0.64574209946	They lost a lot of money, everybody said it couldn't be done.
0.0	0.18437657452	They get -- they steal them.
0.0	0.393363095483	There is a radical jihadist group that is manipulating our immigration system.
0.0	0.464394143294	We eliminate the payroll tax, we eliminate the Obamacare taxes.
0.0	0.57857935931	Our job has to be to recognize the conflict between the two.
0.0	0.591367606237	You know, coal miners and their families who helped turn on the lights and power our factories for generations are now wondering, has our country forgotten us?
0.0	0.724197154285	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, the slower the economy becomes.
0.0	0.321240866122	All right, look, this has been a great debate.
0.0	0.705847696644	You know, we have to stop this because, you know, if we manage to damage ourselves, and we lose the next election, and a progressive gets in there and they get two or three Supreme Court picks, this nation is over as we know it.
0.0	0.607417628082	So, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities.
0.0	0.302306108079	That sounds like a long time ago.
0.0	0.322179316925	No, I oppose it because you're taking money from the entitlement and then spending it immediately on other items.
0.0	0.777531484184	Our wages are growing faster than the national average, and I've cut taxes more than any sitting governor in this state -- $5 billion, including no taxes on small business and killing the death tax.
0.0	0.276790046988	They are -- they're in a position where they're smothering people.

0.0	0.353862961504	I never said that.
0.0	0.71953863034	The idea of 401(k)s. I have a small business that I set up.
0.0	0.470121969911	And that's why 2016 is a turning point in our history.
0.0	0.468499389768	And for the life of me, I have no understanding why the president thinks that everything is going well.
0.0	0.58256590431	I was a child of Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.424674728706	I think it was a mistake to expand Medicaid everywhere in Ohio and across the country.
0.0	0.471035289968	These attack ads are going to be part of life.
0.0	0.535307789032	Corporate inversion is one of the biggest problems we have.
0.0	0.345826042129	We have to find out what's going on.
0.0	0.690822485881	With grandiose language, the president talks about red lines and nothing to follow it up; talks about ISIS being the JV team, they form a caliphate the size of Indiana with 35 (thousand) to 40,000 battle-tested terrorists.
0.0	0.492289948776	There are a lot of people living paycheck to paycheck in Florida as well, they're looking for a senator that will fight for them each and every day.
0.0	0.669724647165	And they consorted with Barack Obama to steal from Social Security.
0.0	0.74819239614	Because so many people in my family worked in steel mills, and they didn't work with a white collar, they worked in a blue collar.
0.0	0.358238139926	I didn't inherit any money.
0.0	0.421954033984	They have got to quit trying to ship rockets into Gaza that can be used against Israel.
0.0	0.299400180465	It was.
0.0	0.511508516239	For example, all right, who in America denies that we have an infrastructure that is crumbling?
0.0	0.233151488324	And just thirdly, he was so nice.
1.0	0.735553676045	Think about it: six and a half million people working part-time.
0.0	0.190544241009	That's my view.
0.0	0.236138434641	So, also, we can stimulate the economy.
0.0	0.459032122969	You know, whatever your issue, your cause, the festering problem you hoped would resolved, the political class has failed you.
0.0	0.254885558928	Thank you, senator.
0.0	0.289237807425	Right there, right next to the plant.
1.0	0.51255578333	We borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.645092602623	I'm very proud of the fact that we have more than 750 thousand donors, and the vast majority of them are giving small contributions.
0.0	0.313010333046	Why didn't they call?
0.0	0.474826930213	Eradicate those and you fix Medicare and you've fixed America, its economy and you've made people's lives a heck of a lot better.
0.0	0.917316492927	We used to have 16 workers for one retiree, now you have three workers for one retiree.
0.0	0.2123609336	...
0.0	0.601658905496	So it's not just the government -- the private sector companies, it's also our own government that needs to raise the level of our game.
0.0	0.678579584432	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.368505518349	We will work with our Sunni allies.
0.0	0.522713870964	And that problem is too big regulations like the EPA, too much new taxes on business that we have seen and "Obamacare."
0.0	0.339752569928	And kind of -- that's what I see our campaign is about right now.
0.0	0.64738370703	You'll create a much better graduation rate at a lower cost, and you won't in debt the next generation with recourse debt on their backs.
0.0	0.233789090576	You get together.
0.0	0.361107233234	You know, I want to go back for a moment to what we were just talking about.
0.0	0.339825432904	Bill, here's the interesting position on this.
0.0	0.157962461367	But what he's touching -- talking about, I think has got merit.
0.0	0.514229459751	They recognize that people's actions don't always match their words.
0.0	0.660157108115	And clearly, what we need to do is get a group of experts together, including people from other countries, some of our friends from Israel, who have had experience screening these people and come up with new guidelines for immigration, and for visas, for people who are coming into this country.
0.0	0.311483735238	Here's the way you need to deal with it.
0.0	0.362665923643	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.411585925858	We have been talking about it for decades.
0.0	0.648082965035	(BELL RINGS) ... and there's a reason, when Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer came after our right to keep and bear arms, that I led the opposition, along with millions of Americans -- we defeated that gun control legislation.
0.0	0.473065543261	No Wall Street executive has been prosecuted.
0.0	0.361785767358	We're going to save Social Security, and we're going to save Medicare.
0.0	0.619001539501	We have $2.5 trillion outside of the United States which we want to bring back in.
0.0	0.492664108808	It would just -- you absolutely have to get involved with China, they are taking so much of what we have in terms of jobs in terms of money.
0.0	0.241166417682	Right.
0.0	0.450633748163	You're an American, as is everybody else on this stage, and I would suggest we focus on who's best prepared to be commander- in-chief, because that's the most important question facing the country.
0.0	0.258816575694	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.450087405391	And that's what I hear from some people, "we'll do nothing and it will just be fixed."
0.0	0.282813779482	I hope the Supreme Court upholds them.
0.0	0.235246698862	It is undermining American democracy.
0.0	0.207320905995	And you know what?
0.0	0.256460833585	But I think there has to be recognition that if we -- if we are too punitive, then you'll go to other -- other technology companies outside the United States.
0.0	0.351446260221	Are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the Assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire?
0.0	0.352322016683	And by those standards, we're not doing particularly well.
0.0	0.174584100469	I think that would have been right, as well.
0.0	0.51906341009	You'll see me on the floor of the Senate tomorrow filibustering this and saying enough is enough, no more debt.
0.0	0.285012329745	Our healthcare is a horror show.
0.0	0.67378901877	Putting Iranian troops right on the border of the Golan right next to Israel would be a nonstarter for me.
0.0	0.21471232722	And, folks, we will.
0.0	0.859354301004	On day one in the Oval Office, I would make two phone calls.
0.0	0.509973992935	And -- and I just want to take this opportunity to say, you know, in the 2012 election, you know, we -- and when I say we, Republicans -- tore themselves apart.
0.0	0.37272855409	We have to protect our 2nd amendment and you cannot do this and certainly what Barack Obama was doing with the executive order.
0.0	0.544057552721	We will invest in education, and jobs for our kids, not incarceration and more jails.
0.0	0.576481696637	The isolationist is the one who wants to continue to follow a foreign policy that has fewer democracies today than when Barack Obama came into office around the world.
0.0	0.349160035284	We have to stop the money flow.
0.0	0.280513792071	People are upset about it.
0.0	0.377304859373	Mr. President, we're not against you.
0.0	0.414483162794	Those jobs, in many cases, are now gone.
0.0	0.293463045256	And we have to take properly vetted refugees ourselves.
1.0	0.229167197495	It's not theirs anymore.
0.0	0.744188222691	But when we talk about Wall Street, you have Wall Street and major banks have paid $200 billion in fines since the great crash.
0.0	0.251709890284	Look, the -- the deal is already done.
0.0	0.466139448445	And when we live by those laws and we treat everybody equally under the law, that's when people feel good about being Americans.
0.0	0.756699073727	The main problem with Medicare right now is that the average person pays in taxes over their whole lifetime about $100,000.
0.0	0.316551068415	You don't have to guess about it, because I actually have a record.
0.0	0.718889050455	Please do not tell me that in this country, if -- and here's the if -- we have the courage to take on the drug companies, and have the courage to take on the insurance companies, and the medical equipment suppliers, if we do that, yes, we can guarantee health care to all people in a much more cost effective way.
0.0	0.356073309062	They don't buy their guns from a collector.
0.0	0.263769263208	The Kurds are our strongest allies.
0.0	0.335266708218	I -- I've been for pausing on admitting the Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.208487162784	But they can't get along.
0.0	0.289584913391	We have to eliminate the sequester, rebuild our military in a way that makes it clear that we're back in the game.
0.0	0.534713311774	I would a whole lot rather had Carly Fiorina over there doing our negotiation than John Kerry.
0.0	0.5	And sadly, in America today, in our economy, a whole lot of those poor people are African-American.
0.0	0.280053798773	And Mr. Trump is very focused...
0.0	0.185884355625	... so you don't actually want to hear the answer, John?
0.0	0.416361950476	So when somebody like Donald Trump and others...
0.0	0.491925998672	Listen, we -- this is the greatest country in the history of mankind.
0.0	0.190135230109	That's essentially what we have now, and we don't need that.
0.0	0.574969508568	I believe in the PTT because it's important those countries in Asia are interfacing against China.
0.0	0.35204328155	That is the thing that obviously makes sense, we can do that.
0.0	0.691661955527	A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to go on a congressional delegation.
0.0	0.209914501307	I'd like to jump in.
0.0	0.162183348722	That's what I think we need to do.
0.0	0.648317845752	If we're going to have a coalition, we're going to have to have a coalition not just of people in the western part of the world, our European allies, but we need the Saudis, we need the Egyptians, we need the Jordanians, we need the Gulf states.
0.0	0.37544948068	And I think the reason he did is because immigration is sort of an example of what's broken and what's wrong in Washington, D..C.
0.0	0.328152594085	We have to get back into looking at what's causing it.
0.0	0.809973276199	You know, the NASDAQ dropped 80 percent -- 80 percent -- and it took 15 years for the NASDAQ to recover.
0.0	0.56330114105	And remember, the Russians have not gone after ISIS or any of the other terrorist groups.
0.0	0.516801801312	Washington gets bigger, taxes get higher, and the American people feel more distance from our government.
0.0	0.227474231698	There are many lawyers.
0.0	0.233761887442	Look, we have to stop with political correctness.
0.0	0.508299176418	They didn't save enough money for us to go to school.
0.0	0.276792019155	Well, I am going to answer your question, Neil.
0.0	0.530824171988	Well, this goes to the question you were just asking.
0.0	0.549764694886	By the way, unlike our country where we're totally predictable and the enemy, whether it's ISIS or anybody else, they know exactly what we're doing because we have the wrong leadership.
0.0	0.222709472383	We can't do it.
0.0	0.231830946528	It goes away.
0.0	0.282620171165	... that's what you say in a primary.
0.0	0.797496465407	I worked hard with not only federal agents but with police officers and here's the problem, sanctuary cities is part of the problem in this country.
0.0	0.579117493153	And he stood before the American people and he said, "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself," a profound statement that gave the American people the courage to believe that, yes, we could get out of that terrible depression.
0.0	0.407036521615	Without China, North Korea doesn't even eat.
0.0	0.613484198028	And -- you know, all of this too big to fail stuff and picking and choosing winners and losers -- this is a bunch of crap, and it is really causing a great deal of -- great deal of problems for our society right now.
0.0	0.200982120085	Well, yes, indeed.
0.0	0.232140206989	Or somebody else.
0.0	0.471781127357	To talk about we're just gonna have a 10 percent tithe and that's how we're gonna fund the government?
0.0	0.373169190172	Well, gee, after the last debate, I was told that I didn't smile enough.
0.0	0.250999457234	No, it's your record.
0.0	0.935897313551	$19 billion of tax cuts, 1.3 million jobs created.
0.0	0.18885024783	I think America can only live up to its potential when we make sure that every American has a chance to live up to his or her potential.
0.0	0.179944070949	This is extraordinary.
0.0	0.576947001408	A lot has happened in nine months.
0.0	0.421986902826	I think there's a sense in this country today that somehow our best days are behind us.
0.0	0.720038430716	On top of that, there is a business flat tax of 16 percent.
0.0	0.254539637958	Everybody knows that.
0.0	0.327512950364	A law has been sitting -- languishing, sadly, on Capitol Hill and has not yet been passed, and it would help.
0.0	0.343006272005	Sometimes it's a complicated situation, but some things are black and white.
0.0	0.581875366849	Government causes a problem, and then government steps in to solve the problem.
0.0	0.323051526108	I am convinced that this president, if he could get rid of the Second Amendment, he would.
0.0	0.203490590957	They are refusing to...
0.0	0.896491220089	I went into Ohio where we had an $8 billion hole and now we have a $2 billion surplus.
0.0	0.563587589195	Had that actually -- that same columnist wrote a column comparing me to an evil demonic spirit from the move, "It Follows" that jumps apparently from body to body possessing people.
0.0	0.243048313004	I opposed and oppose legalization and citizenship.
0.0	0.25560171612	If you're a Washington lobbyist, if you make your money in and around Washington, things are doing great.
0.0	0.237870935276	OK?
0.0	0.412781274657	It's like a tariff, but here's the difference: if we impose a tariff, China responds.
0.0	0.234452324942	It's not working.
0.0	0.182384498495	... and I'll tell you why.
0.0	0.250923927923	... replacing dependency with opportunity.
0.0	0.61252184257	I've lived my whole life fighting -- fighting for things that I believe in, fighting for justice and to protect people from crime and terrorism, fighting to stand up for folks who have not had enough and need an opportunity to get more, and to stand up and fight against the special interests.
0.0	0.21474598307	I will not do that.
0.0	0.391326123568	But in 2015, we have a very different economy.
0.0	0.166518542221	We need somebody who can lead.
0.0	0.64709886229	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.390801441866	What we have to do is end over-policing in African- American neighborhoods.
0.0	0.206276214974	Well, this is what I would say.
0.0	0.558051184529	Terrorism is on the run, China, Russia is advancing their agenda at warp speed, and we pull back.
0.0	0.611713312272	You know, I listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas.
0.0	0.406960115055	I don't agree that we're going to occupy and spend another decade or a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.74628937245	We cannot afford four more years of on the job training.
0.0	0.375005049865	They've been beaten into submission.
0.0	0.244934234444	But I guess I'm supposed to come out great.
0.0	0.251466424282	And, the fact is, none of them.
0.0	0.247824495697	We are all frustrated with what China is doing.
0.0	0.600564652674	One of the great challenges that we have, $150 billion is fixing to go to a country that killed our Marines in Lebanon, that used their weapons to kill our young men in Iran.
0.0	0.271637629533	What would motivate me and what would be the guiding light for me in terms of immigration reform, Judy, is to bring families together, not divide them up.
0.0	0.700795146566	And they got a killer in San Bernardino in posing as a fiance.
0.0	0.374656275604	But I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost.
0.0	0.383909991638	Yes, they have to stop trying to destabilize the Middle East, causing even more chaos.
0.0	0.421882887592	I was governor on September 11th, and I'm proud of my leadership in bringing New York through that time.
0.0	0.715338943344	We've been the most pro-life state six years in a row.
0.0	0.389163752263	I think it's a mistake to create new and more expensive entitlement programs when we can't afford the ones we've got today.
0.0	0.81051506467	Well, let me tell you one thing that I am the only guy: The only guy that has consistently fought the Clinton machine every election I was ever in over the past 26 years.
0.0	0.161926064367	And you know, he's right.
0.0	0.580526500413	That sounds like people are afraid the president's going to take their guns away.
0.0	0.434418584991	Let's listen to them and let's not listen to our politicians.
0.0	0.517869750085	And it costs, with dynamic scoring, less than a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.25595581127	The government ought to wear a striped shirt and just make sure the game...
0.0	0.244418801622	Take it from your professors...
0.0	0.179948822625	I want to use that same up here, whatever it may be to make America rich again and to make America great again.
0.0	0.659309731824	But it is absolutely fair and necessary for Americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average American family?
0.0	0.388726168017	... and as president, I'm going to fight for the working men and women.
0.0	0.343259227633	He hit oil.
0.0	0.416146519614	We both have a lot of small donors.
0.0	0.42966992925	I believe we should be appointing Supreme Court justices who will follow the law and not try to make the law.
0.0	0.366796368922	Our friends no longer think we have their back and our enemies no longer fear us, and we're in a much difficult -- we're in a much different position than we should be.
0.0	0.229180992548	And why?
0.0	0.644642052819	That tells you right away where he was headed on all of this.
0.0	0.602127896889	Well, he appointed Eric Holder as attorney general.
0.0	0.231286865115	That's all I'm saying.
0.0	0.194562349482	And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word.
0.0	0.219849888911	Yes, it's very simple.
0.0	0.481939115025	And it's not the folks on Wall Street.
0.0	0.252861380382	That is not protected free speech.
0.0	0.209095680213	In all due respect...
0.0	0.410876750609	We're bringing corporate taxes down, bringing money back in, corporate inversions.
0.0	0.327689274527	Two quick responses.
0.0	0.286608255267	I'm going to prioritize those recipients who need the most help first.
0.0	0.591396081455	Imagine -- imagine -- if a politician were held to that standard of account.
0.0	0.227642988705	I want a government so small I can barely see it.
0.0	0.19442432077	This is a humanitarian catastrophe.
0.0	0.414249366669	And I ask everyone in America to call Congress tomorrow and say enough is enough; no more debt.
0.0	0.211447904979	We have to obey the laws.
0.0	0.257320596185	That's not even an issue.
0.0	0.425127943929	You know, we've got a lot of great talkers running for president.
0.0	0.389459402798	I've tried to be as specific to answer questions so that my proposals can be vetted, because I feel like we have to level with people for the very reason, Gwen, that you are mentioning.
0.0	0.734846285573	We took a loan against our assets to invest it in that campaign to defend ourselves against those attacks.
0.0	0.32190295971	-- work better to lift everyone up, men and women.

1.0	0.261962574299	He said, "we don't have leverage with China to get a better deal on Iran because we need them to lend us money to continue operating our government."
1.0	0.329790492088	There aren't enough good-paying jobs, especially for young people.
0.0	0.341510103016	And I agree about the role that he played both in war and in peace on the economy and defeating fascism around the world.
0.0	0.22539294551	I would hope that we could all agree that we are sick and tired of seeing videos on television of unarmed people, often African-Americans, shot by police officers.
0.0	0.268223678694	I mean, so don't -- so you can't -- you can't...
0.0	0.169761479438	That's what we need.
0.0	0.236774924112	We need somebody who can balance budgets, cut taxes...
0.0	0.16143507927	So I don't know if you would call that a weakness, but my wife said "let up."
0.0	0.348246384511	But we have to restore policing that will actually protect the communities that police officers are sworn to protect.
0.0	0.400627956536	We're going to cut Social Security to help you.
0.0	0.210478892071	I know we have a president who wants to do whatever he wants to do, and take his pen and his phone and just tell everybody what he thinks is best.
0.0	0.478284915924	But the reason America is a great country, the reason is because our compassion is in our laws.
0.0	0.455650474664	We have a huge mental health problem in this country.
0.0	0.329057992586	Why don't you wait in line?
0.0	0.308218570926	What we need now is a proven leader who has produced results.
0.0	0.632580375776	And in that interview, he explained his views on a whole host of issues that were very, very different from the views he's describing now.
0.0	0.813729004629	When I left the workforce, New York State had been reduced by over 15 percent.
0.0	0.240504745613	We will arm and train the Kurds.
0.0	0.458213049768	We have got to demilitarize local police departments so they do not look like occupying armies.
0.0	0.667718558879	We're going to have a three-bracket tax code, 10, 15 and 25 percent.
0.0	0.731536132385	Twenty-four months ago, 36 months ago, you did not have a group of radical crazies named ISIS who were burning people in cages and recruiting people to enter our country legally.
0.0	0.811308936234	I chaired the National Commission on Homeland Security Committee for United States.
0.0	0.292611837814	So, yes, we can talk about it as a racial issue.
0.0	0.463568067195	It's called the mainstream media who every single day...
0.0	0.720429387193	And that's what you'll hear from Hillary Clinton -- and I've already heard from her -- is that, send more money in Social Security, send more money in Medicare taxes, send more money for Medicaid, and that's gonna solve the problem.
0.0	0.342698103976	We're not -- the American people -- forget about anything else, they've already been lied to and stolen from.
0.0	0.441668226861	And that's what we should focus on is the violence in our communities.
0.0	0.842591672918	There have been more than 4,000 changes to the tax plan since 2001 alone.
0.0	0.626181140502	Almost every hotel in Atlantic City has either been in bankruptcy or will be in bankruptcy -- the biggest.

0.0	0.422649940626	You can trust me to do the following: that when I get on change with Hillary Clinton, we won't be debating about the science, we'll be debating about the solutions.
0.0	0.258990410895	Freedom is personal for me, and I will always keep my word and fight for freedom.
0.0	0.453528788004	The final observation, invoked Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.241241379828	That never works.
0.0	0.566678120006	We need to make sure that people understand, as Jeb said before, that if you've done extraordinarily well in this country, do you want them to take more out of your taxes now and think they're gonna give it back to you later?
0.0	0.675729982748	Well, let's just -- let's just follow up on this, because, you know, I've made it very clear that no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail, and because of Dodd-Frank, we now have in law a process that the president, the Federal Reserve, and others can use if any bank poses a systemic risk.
0.0	0.289998330904	But I also think that these are very serious times; 75 percent of the American people think the federal government is corrupt.
0.0	0.320855987429	We have the Russians and the Iranians working together, not to fight ISIS, but to prop up Assad.
0.0	0.696807299299	And in fact, Kissinger's actions in Cambodia, when the United States bombed that country, overthrew Prince Sihanouk, created the instability for Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge to come in, who then butchered some 3 million innocent people, one of the worst genocides in the history of the world.
0.0	0.184645579186	We need to get realistic about this.
0.0	0.407145688531	A healthy environment, a strong economy and energy independent America -- that would be the purpose of my presidency, is break the strangle hold that people enjoy on fossil fuels who hate our guts.
0.0	0.29250582329	So we have a disagreement on this.
0.0	0.261062401621	They pay tax once overseas.
0.0	0.891936537398	I built a net worth of way over $10 billion, and I have done it four times out of hundreds.
0.0	0.642381979133	Let me concur with the secretary, no question women's rights are under fierce attack all over this country.
0.0	0.679061580609	And some of them, I will say, not all, have called me and said, "Donald, thank you very much; you're exposing an unbelievable problem and we have to get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.840851051157	I voted against it because the Southern Poverty Law Center, among other groups, said that the guest-worker programs that were embedded in this agreement were akin to slavery.
0.0	0.388918927364	Nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with.
0.0	0.223482799789	Thank you.
0.0	0.168065831702	And, I also just want to thank the audience for being attentive, and noticing the questions, and the noticing the answers.
0.0	0.5	Yes, in my view, the government of a democratic society has a moral responsibility to play a vital role in making sure all of our people have a decent standard of living.
0.0	0.223482799789	Thank you.
0.0	0.488422587919	Why in God's name does Wall Street...
0.0	0.33536706075	And I've got to tell you, it sounded like everything in the world was going amazing, you know?
0.0	0.212779812317	That's a blessing.
0.0	0.291726747199	We need a leader who will lead the resurgence of this great nation and unlock its potential once again.
0.0	0.0816907093034	I frankly don't think there will be much change because I think what's going to happen is you're going to get more of the same.
0.0	0.5128214809	And that's what this economy needs to -- that's what this debate needs to be about.
0.0	0.742651831924	She admitted she had sent e-mails to her family saying, "Hey, this attack at Benghazi was caused by Al Qaida-like elements."
0.0	0.245572889328	That's fine.
0.0	0.42626996578	We're going to have too many people in the cart rather than pulling the cart.
0.0	0.524380779895	Look, it takes three things basically to grow jobs.
0.0	0.35531039036	And not only did I fight them and win, I lived to tell about it and I'm standing on this stage tonight as evidence of that.
0.0	0.575773514423	But I think a pause on Syrian refugees has been exactly right for all the governors that have called for it, and also, of course, for me as the governor of Ohio.
1.0	0.695943664731	But we have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977.
0.0	0.264445725544	We need someone to fight for the people.
0.0	0.705316857594	There is a bill sitting in the House that would actually pass and have us go to zero-based budgeting so we know where every dime of your money is being spent instead of only talking about how much more we're going to spend year after year after year.
0.0	0.206085176748	The fact is, the reason why...
0.0	0.235945917506	Bipartisan issue.
0.0	0.198243682995	We need to come together as a country because we have to realize that America is great, not from the top-down.
0.0	0.519789625063	I was invoked in that question, so let me just say -- in that answer -- let me say, the real question here, I hate to interrupt this episode of Court TV.
0.0	0.74957256474	Former elected prosecutor, attorney general, governor, I was elected to all of those offices.
0.0	0.344483279654	We used to win, we don't win anymore.
0.0	0.486573902057	So what I will tell you about our incentives -- our incentives are tight, and at the end of the day we make sure that we gain more from the creation of jobs than what we lose.
0.0	0.273691081302	The number of women --
0.0	0.283014629584	But you know, here's the real issue, is this America anymore?
0.0	0.244264726996	Now Maria, listen.
0.0	0.365086825803	Neil, I was mentioned too.
0.0	0.5	Half of them had tears pouring down their face.
0.0	0.548945086482	I believe that when real unemployment is close to 10%, and when our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, Flint, Michigan comes to mind.
0.0	0.492497000234	Because we can't just save the American Dream, we can expand it to reach more people, and change more lives than ever before.
0.0	0.663584822063	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you had better get rid of the super PACs, because they're causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that are being made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.801498797054	You know, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took the oath of office in 1933 at a time when 25 percent of the American people were unemployed, country was in incredible despair.
1.0	0.711493091128	If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world -- and we double tax, as you know.
0.0	0.469463820045	The more the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected are advantaged.
0.0	0.4304161539	But the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with Iran, maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world, yes, that is something I want to achieve.
0.0	0.140193664302	For once, let's do that, and stop trying to give them some kind of fantasy that's never going to come true.
0.0	0.234723337685	We're running.
0.0	0.338747385773	And that's why we're in the trouble that we're in now.
0.0	0.469963814354	And that was the state of Texas.
0.0	0.225257467849	I want to take off from that point and argue the same thing.
0.0	0.309840146834	Why weren't they vigilant?
0.0	0.238076584733	And for good cause.
0.0	0.248770545695	Probably, I don't know -- you people write the stuff.
0.0	0.275567320493	It's what I've done or not done, or it's war.
0.0	0.75624188728	And I'll tell you why, last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee, she admitted she had sent emails to her family saying, hey, this attack in Benghazi was caused by al Qaeda-like elements.
0.0	0.63928074711	So that is not by any stretch a pie in the sky.
0.0	0.301558341958	So conservatives actually do come out of Manhattan, including William F. Buckley and others, just so you understand.
0.0	0.403177680782	And we know of the tragic, terrible event that lead to the death of Dontre Hamilton right here in Milwaukee, a young man unarmed, who should still be with us.
0.0	0.601590107935	The big corporations have the scale to deal with all of this.
0.0	0.378288651187	Get it done, because our -- our children and grandchildren are counting on us to get it done.
0.0	0.165825415104	They say, " well, we don't really have control."
0.0	0.698994510497	So when you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration -- which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother -- clearly, we are looking at institutional racism.
0.0	0.805711284838	My 750,000 donors have contributed more than a million and a half donations.
0.0	0.422218670255	And I think when you give low-income kids -- African-American, white, Latino kids -- the opportunities to get their lives together, they are not going to end up in jail.
0.0	0.616912696503	Where did that spirit come from in America?
0.0	0.164348671973	They're tough, they're strong, they're great people.
0.0	0.346376931666	We need to be focusing on what fixes this country.
0.0	0.690055450819	So you don't get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.540325443542	You know, that's what the PC culture is all about, and it's destroying this nation.
0.0	0.365620497786	They don't believe in building walls and a pessimistic view of the future.
1.0	0.277322527291	It isn't there anymore, Mike.
0.0	0.644091650882	We are nineteen trillion dollars -- our country's a mess and we can't let all these people come into our country and break our borders.
0.0	0.68256490555	We have more Americans out of work or just Americans who quit looking for work for 40 years.
1.0	0.920692998093	When President Obama came into office we were losing 800,000 jobs a month, 800,000 jobs a month.
0.0	0.507320856516	And, you know the old inscription, if you save one life, you've changed the world.
0.0	0.586148467782	Well, first of all, under President Jeb Bush, we would restore the strength of the military.
0.0	0.712018670116	Because Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama.
0.0	0.621827281276	They will also have to pay 16 percent on the money they pay their employees.
0.0	0.638198324768	We have to get down to creating a country that's not going to have the kind of problems that we've had with people flying planes into the World Trade Centers, with the -- with the shootings in California, with all the problems all over the world.
0.0	0.73354568209	Well, one of us ran against Barack Obama.
0.0	0.300808353215	We're nowhere close to a balanced budget or fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.435089568998	A Republican Congress did that.
0.0	0.355476972588	If I'm president of the United States and Congress tries to cut the military, I will veto that in a millisecond.
0.0	0.257579452684	We need to have some coalitions in that part of the world to go after ISIS, but we also need to send a clear message.
0.0	0.260303522617	Look, here is the reality, folks.
0.0	0.224657256711	Divide that out.
0.0	0.342589630456	Just for the record.
0.0	0.5	But what happened is a political vacuum developed.
0.0	0.570338841492	I'm the only person on this stage who's done that and we will get it done as President of the United States.
0.0	0.43386943333	I am not a member of the political class.
0.0	0.550644469865	And aligned with a corrupt campaign finance system is a rigged economy.
0.0	0.233789090576	You're right.
0.0	0.659237913571	And I give you my word, if I am elected president, no service man or service woman will be forced to be on their knees, and any nation that captures our fighting men will feel the full force and fury of the United States of America.
0.0	0.675256886497	It took -- it took an arm and a leg to be able to set up a 401(k).
1.0	0.762065326989	Workforce participation rates lower than they were in 1977.
0.0	0.689992785373	I would note, just for a historic aside, somebody told me earlier today we've had like 200 presidential primary debates, and this is the first time there have been a majority of women on the stage.
0.0	0.725017220284	The issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24 months ago.
0.0	0.53868199755	It is time for Republicans in D.C. to fight.
0.0	0.767920982172	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.389287804431	There's no way he launches 11 attack --
0.0	0.249506222959	They're very, very badly wounded.
0.0	0.437071440783	You've got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.5	And it's a tax you find in many companies in Europe.
0.0	0.191358332601	It is a real horror.
0.0	0.262577268112	This would be devastating for the economy.
0.0	0.440862689732	It did not come from our Judeo-Christian roots, I can tell you that.
0.0	0.248868410212	So we've got some real work to do, and let's try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the Russians.
0.0	0.28519261078	You want to talk about what we're going to be up against next year?
0.0	0.204541706149	Again...
0.0	0.390600620714	And he was a managing general partner.
0.0	0.251028797545	I want to take care of women.
0.0	0.388269798888	I think he means somebody who hasn't been a career politician, and who's been out of office for awhile.
0.0	0.747881083266	And that's what I'll offer to the people of the United States in this candidacy for the presidency.
0.0	0.192801605546	I just want to thank all my colleagues here for being civil, and not falling for the traps.
0.0	0.692196739703	So if we want to pick and choose -- and I certainly do -- people I listen to, people I don't listen to, people I listen to for certain areas, then I think we have to be fair and look at the entire world, because it's a big, complicated world out there.
0.0	0.582922070627	You know, we could give you another example -- the Marines, the Army, these wonderful six soldiers that were killed.
0.0	0.48295317896	But yes, there is more collaboration required between private sector companies and the public sector.
0.0	0.239173220423	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.400867606684	Well, with respect to Syria, I really do appreciate the efforts that Secretary Kerry has made.
0.0	0.460980450023	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.330385349363	If we -- if we don't act now, we are going to be the first generation in American history that leaves our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.870731274705	We were one of two states to go to AAA bond rating, and our government spending was far less than the spending in people's income.
0.0	0.741493942793	Got 70 votes in the United States Senate.
0.0	0.752982433175	Imagine how hard it is for these people out there that are making 40, 50, $60,000 a year, and they're trying to provide for their families at a time when this economy is not growing.
0.0	0.409768205341	It's why you see Walgreens buying Rite Aid.
0.0	0.467791125949	It's a simple formula: common sense regulations, which is why I think we should freeze all federal regulations for one year, except for health and safety.
0.0	0.573397739797	The questions that are being asked shouldn't be trying to get people to tear into each other.
0.0	0.206299165194	I'll say this.
0.0	0.250868347117	And it's the most regressive tax there is.
0.0	0.310505114648	But many, many people did.
0.0	0.506429165608	I like Marco too, and two years ago, he called me a conservative reformer that New Jersey needed.
0.0	0.296076184965	We don't have to have refugees come to our country, but all Muslims, seriously?
0.0	0.672696815429	You see, all of my career, I've fought about giving voice to the people that I grew up with and voice to the people that elected me.
0.0	0.261488264677	We haven't done so.
0.0	0.419922334308	You just have to look today at Indonesia, bombings all over.
0.0	0.631846938066	The truth is that sentencing for blacks is higher than for whites.
0.0	0.307684616561	The people that Washington leaves behind.
0.0	0.636149528432	I don't think they dropped all the amendments into a hat and picked them out of a hat.
0.0	0.20312210223	Let me, you know, again, respectfully disagree with Secretary Clinton here.
1.0	0.828125929974	If you look at a single mom buying groceries, she sees hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent.
0.0	0.40356626325	Military action, Maria, would be used when it was absolutely necessary to protect American lives and protect American interests around the world.
0.0	0.195719566307	I'm angry because our country is a mess.
0.0	0.359829673169	He is undermining our standing in the world.
0.0	0.211107060533	He's a gifted politician.
0.0	0.424988710149	She voted for it.
0.0	0.410614054662	What are the rules on who gets to follow up.
0.0	0.230863268951	Or that we're just going to be great?
0.0	0.530338868483	The contrast with the Democratic debate, where every fawning question from the media was, "Which of you is more handsome and why?"
0.0	0.381046688375	So, we are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we have to root out in our society.
0.0	0.57669336512	While there are lots of good ideas for reform, we have never tackled the basics.
0.0	0.342934960594	You know, the Russians wanted to buy time.
0.0	0.716733345927	And then, after the war, this is the guy who, in fact, yes, you're right, he opened up relations with China, and now pushed various type of trade agreements, resulting in American workers losing their jobs as corporations moved to China.
0.0	0.455530858608	But guess who pushed for that regulation?
0.0	0.617315989543	And what a sad sight that was: Men, women, children forced out of their homes.
0.0	0.200326306175	That's good.
0.0	0.475453773258	The only way we're going to defund Planned Parenthood is have a pro-life president.
0.0	0.212682366522	Because, I've got to tell you the truth, even in New Jersey what you're doing is called rude.
0.0	0.28314336663	And we have to take on ISIS online.
0.0	0.636091307907	I'm going to be introducing a plan which I call the 2020 Perfect Vision for America.
0.0	0.234580332886	It's not fair trade.
0.0	0.367544719544	We do that, this country would be safe and secure again not only from criminals but from the terrorist who threaten us as well.
0.0	0.355482919065	The millionaires and billionaires are doing great under Obama.
0.0	0.665040182394	... that he tried to take credit for four years later.
0.0	0.633756847497	I can tell you, after spending seven years as a former federal prosecutor, right after 9/11, dealing with this issue.
0.0	0.896174532622	We cut taxes and we had a $5 trillion projected surplus when I left.
0.0	0.291837497819	We lose with ISIS.
0.0	0.265785794707	Not a very pleasant place to be.
0.0	0.339522983919	I'm asking people to support me because I think I'm the most qualified, experienced, and ready person to be the president and the commander- in-chief.
0.0	0.50533454943	And then in addition to that, the American people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.230258857656	It's not constitutional.
0.0	0.208935422434	But this is nothing new.
0.0	0.240977033502	Nobody -- I could stand up here all night.
0.0	0.186743455149	I absolutely would call on them to collaborate and cooperate, yes.
0.0	0.255117909389	You lead and you produce results.
0.0	0.397598247792	That is why there is massive despair all over this country.
0.0	0.252528496796	You know, I am by my nature impatient.
0.0	0.224209257539	I am deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.517293854146	And I spent my entire lifetime balancing federal budgets, growing jobs, the same in Ohio.
0.0	0.633962719506	Sometimes it's because the Federal Reserve kept interest rates so low that the wealthy were able to invest in -- in strong assets like the stock market when everybody else was left behind.
0.0	0.517794518839	We've cut 26 percent of our budget.
0.0	0.239061590137	Let the states do this.
0.0	0.571419274316	And they came back with 23 recommendations.
0.0	0.284103519822	Now, you've got Europe.
0.0	0.338820045414	I said, absolutely, you can still change the world.
0.0	0.670800973643	And when FDR said, "Yeah, it is," that we're going to use all of the resources that we have to create jobs, to build homes, to feed people, to protect the farmers, we are a nation which if we come together there is nothing that we could not accomplish.
0.0	0.310739213367	Not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.329781461966	This is about more than replacing a D with an R. We need a leader who will help us take our government back.
0.0	0.196427537902	Well, Gwen and Judy, thank you very much for hosting this event.
0.0	0.285998958598	You know, you look at women working.
0.0	0.249965738068	I like Marco Rubio.
0.0	0.476979841596	For both of them you have to gradually raise the age.
0.0	0.635610777423	But if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things, including corporate taxes, and including the capital gains taxes, you make that amount up pretty quickly.
0.0	0.571407833478	Businesses will now have to pay 16 percent on the money they make.
0.0	0.383034828556	If you looking at what happened with Boeing and if you look at what happened with so many companies that deal -- so we don't have an equal playing field.
0.0	0.237870935276	Okay.
0.0	0.369457877601	We bailed them out.
0.0	0.684820567031	Martha, we got a lot of politicians that will kiss babies, cut ribbons, do whatever it takes to be popular.
0.0	0.618780311528	He's a left-wing judicial activist, Harvard Law professor who was Al Gore's lawyer in Bush versus Gore.
0.0	0.17493562945	We need sound money.
0.0	0.189059469965	I'm too agreeable, easy going.
0.0	0.330305396239	It was a terrible sight.
0.0	0.511807036736	Because criminals don't buy their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.672535810059	Marco stood with Chuck Schumer and Barack Obama on amnesty.
0.0	0.272962974433	We have to offer a compelling alternative that is based on hope and optimism and grounded in serious policy, which I've laid out.
0.0	0.550106323074	Because when government gets big and powerful, the big feel like they need to get even bigger to deal with all that power, and meanwhile, the small and the powerless -- in this case, 1,590 community banks -- go out of business.
0.0	0.142931503847	And yes, I am angry.
0.0	0.829996816127	The biggest tax increase happened under the watch of Barack Obama, and spending's gone up.
0.0	0.344921324882	The entire system of legal immigration must now be reexamined for security first and foremost, with an eye on ISIS.
0.0	0.197598500174	Let me just -- let me respond.
0.0	0.208118344706	This is a great nation.
0.0	0.285401215784	It would not necessitate us raising any taxes.
0.0	0.348581164438	I'm asking folks not just to join my campaign, but join a cause.
0.0	0.617875344915	Mine is unique in the sense that my tax plan actually gets rid of the payroll tax as well.
0.0	0.444146703478	That's real moral authority that we need in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.555913462189	Well, we've gotta turn the economy around for people who are struggling.
0.0	0.799914574431	I was governor of New York on September 11.
0.0	0.233134332638	You know, they feel like if they don't have a lobbyist, if they're not wealthy, that somehow they don't get to play.
0.0	0.576974021317	Whether it's welfare reform and getting something back for the hard-earned taxpayers; whether it's engaging in Pentagon reform and taking on the big contractors that were charging thousands of dollars for hammers and screw drivers and ripping us off; or whether it's taking on the special interests in the nursing home industry in Ohio, so that mom and dad can have the ability to stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.
0.0	0.236470536508	But we are where we are right now.
0.0	0.339244437055	And everything is costing more money, and we are killing our -- our -- our people like this.
0.0	0.539526634126	Who actually has stood up not just to Democrats, but to leaders in our own party?
0.0	0.329915186821	But let's not -- but let's not -- let's not insult -- let's not insult the intelligence of the American people.
0.0	0.406803310126	And, they're always going to say, "Well, we're going to fix this one day."
0.0	0.289025254768	They look around for gun-free zones.
0.0	0.2280047595	It is a false choice.
0.0	0.559438945142	Why don't we just give a chicken in every pot, while we're, you know, coming up -- coming up with these fantasy tax schemes.
0.0	0.612813564964	And one more point, one more point.
0.0	0.529829465542	And when I'm president, we're not just going to have a president that gives a State of the Union and says America is the greatest country in the world.
0.0	0.286449685178	I think we're on the verge of the greatest time, and I want to fix the things to let people rise up.
0.0	0.237889732258	And wherever you are sitting Nikki, I'm a friend.
0.0	0.412130947232	There is a war against ISIS, not just against ISIS but against radical jihadists terrorists, and it is a war that they win or we win.
0.0	0.263031599026	But I think I'll go back to building buildings if it doesn't work out.
0.0	0.230547141669	I don't think it's a war on women for all of us as Americans to stand up and stop harvesting organs from little babies.
0.0	0.292933315967	Hardworking immigrant families living in fear, who should be brought out of the shadows so they and their children can have a better future.
0.0	0.345521034074	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.5	We're a country of laws, not of men, not of people who do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.223095350108	I think the times are different now.
0.0	0.421507157912	Let us actually go to zero- based budgeting so we know where the money is being spent.
0.0	0.274556102669	I like Chris Christie, but we can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports Common Core.
0.0	0.543573650999	As president of the United States, I will be a commander in chief that will have the back of the military.
0.0	0.457516032649	I don't remember you ever complaining about John McCain's vote record.
0.0	0.336838595754	China is ripping us on trade.
0.0	0.460676805671	Well, I think, Judy, what has to be appreciated is that, as a result of the disastrous and illegal behavior on Wall Street, millions of lives were hurt.
1.0	0.489954484413	And they've stolen from you because now they know they cannot pay these benefits and Social Security is going to be insolvent in seven to eight years.
0.0	0.38458942517	But, now for millions of Americans, it's slipping away.
0.0	0.424494594857	Well, first of all, if a company gets caught doing that, they should never be able to use the program again.
0.0	0.292343622001	Look, that's who I stand up for.
0.0	0.216421314056	And what we want to do is to control this.
0.0	0.555095069455	And the people who are getting hammered are small businesses, it's single moms, it's Hispanics.
0.0	0.271530612704	... tariffs that come against us.
0.0	0.251696512323	He is a good man.
0.0	0.172962903756	I think it's a good product.
0.0	0.479041800351	The worker's out of a job.
0.0	0.537716186574	Anybody who tells me that we need every penny and every one of those is in a fantasy world.
0.0	0.17460379525	What we need to do is destroy their ability to attack us here over there, and then get out.
0.0	0.177887044653	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.477388648019	I would choose Nelson Mandela for his generosity of heart, his understanding of the need for reconciliation.
0.0	0.308432069655	I will begin tomorrow to filibuster it.
0.0	0.378251853897	And Lehman Brothers started it all.
0.0	0.369035040031	You can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.577506236559	Part of the reason why it hasn't risen because sometimes we're not giving people the skills they need.
0.0	0.330703294239	Nothing has to change for current beneficiaries.
1.0	0.786658912947	We do what the American people want, to expand Social Security by $1,300 a year for people under $16,000, and we extend the life of Social Security for 58 years.
0.0	0.700196614408	Yes, I believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on Wall Street, that they are a Wall Street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession -- Great Depression.
1.0	0.418795596228	Everybody voted for it wanting to see Libya move toward democracy, of course we all wanted to do that.
0.0	0.66375351871	I voted for comprehensive immigration reform in 2007.
0.0	0.264898324007	They're never going to let it happen.
0.0	0.44268047998	John Harwood, there's a bigger issue here.
0.0	0.648032551938	So I'm going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of Americans fulfilling their potential, because I don't think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single American to live up to theirs.
0.0	0.378658902491	So I have nothing at all critical of him.
0.0	0.208144033737	Well, I want to know, did you win?
0.0	0.269883102194	No, I didn't care (inaudible).
0.0	0.28584276072	Let me say, I read that editorial today with a great amusement.
0.0	0.34078964691	The government has tried it their way.
0.0	0.369320248025	If you elect me president of the United States, I will secure that southern border.
0.0	0.266456302588	Let me translate that for you.
0.0	0.252022790085	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.333403554953	And I ended a federal entitlement.
0.0	0.597052692456	Meantime, wages have stagnated for 40 years.
0.0	0.411744262956	It's a problem all over the world.
0.0	0.335511187563	I've been passionate my whole life about the Constitution.
0.0	0.673645225303	They know that this country is pushing the middle class, the hardworking taxpayers, backwards, and they saw a president who doesn't understand their pain, and doesn't have any plan for getting away from it.
0.0	0.424276155292	Jeb Bush, why have your numbers fallen?
0.0	0.607555604618	We have to put the personnel on that border in the right places; you have to put the strategic fencing in place; and you have to have aviation assets that fly all the way from Tijuana to El Paso to Brownsville, Texas -- 1,933 miles looking down 24/7, with the technology to be able to identify what individuals are doing, and ID when they are in obviously illegal activities or suspicious activities, and quick response teams come.
0.0	0.517839042648	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the free enterprise system.
0.0	0.541656536211	And this president turns his back -- this president doesn't enforce the marijuana laws in this country because he doesn't agree with them.
0.0	0.345847249888	And you shouldn't have mentioned the polls because I would have been much...
0.0	0.274825888914	They are devaluing -- it's so impossible for -- you look at Caterpillar Tractor and what's happening with Caterpillar and Kamatsu (ph).
0.0	0.5	Well, Secretary Clinton, you're not in the White House yet.
0.0	0.730826984196	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.357899138844	And right now, I will be putting up a tremendous -- so far, I've put up less than anybody and I have the best results.
0.0	0.386397892327	Look, the Second Amendment is not an option.
0.0	0.542077428919	That's absurd, and I think people who don't want to fix it, really, or unwilling to take the chance to say, "something has to change," are missing the boat here.
0.0	0.555398891669	Because this president has consistently underestimated the threat of ISIS.
0.0	0.663678227466	In my case, whether it's health care, or getting us to debt-free tuition, or moving us toward paid family leave, I have been very specific about where I would raise the money, how much it would cost, and how I would move this agenda forward.
0.0	0.206993457059	We need to have stronger families.
0.0	0.747868917289	I did a couple of speeches for them, I do speeches for other people.
0.0	0.420835769034	... that, having been in the trenches fighting for this, I believe strongly we have to guarantee health care.
0.0	0.487693999664	Number one, we have to create better paying jobs.
0.0	0.442528901888	That's how you go from secretary to CEO.
0.0	0.346155108982	They are trying to attack us here in America.
0.0	0.39910616677	My Muslim friends, some, said, "thank you very much; we'll get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.661279418009	Really systemic racism in this state, as in others, education, in employment, in the kinds of factors that too often lead from a position where young people, particularly young men, are pushed out of school early, are denied employment opportunities.
0.0	0.476233582093	We know (ph) to go ahead and shut off the supply routes, and send in our special ops at 2:00 a.m. and attack them everywhere they go.
0.0	0.623509093643	The point I'm making is this, the Federal Government should not be in a lot of things.
0.0	0.279535092124	So why are the pharmaceutical companies consolidating?
0.0	0.209529144451	That has not been...
0.0	0.21298093894	What we need to do is destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.260023892768	I'll check for you.
0.0	0.364359066729	It is time to believe in America again.
0.0	0.414261173301	It was Countrywide Mortgage.
0.0	0.218644264109	And I would not support those.
0.0	0.245209958288	No, the new planes.
0.0	0.437579026874	If I have a weakness, it's that I try to live by the rules.
0.0	0.229690566353	They have infrastructure.
0.0	0.214987738457	It will never happen because they'll let their currency go up.
0.0	0.739249767336	That is like shouting "fire" in a crowded theater, and that is illegal, and I would do everything in our power not just to go after those who are here who we know who are here, before they can radicalize other Americans to carry out attacks, and it's not just the ones they've arrested.
0.0	0.679422964194	I was very honored to be asked to do that and very honored to serve with him those first four years.
0.0	0.564491950094	I think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether it's poison in the water of the children of Flint, or whether it's the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the LGBT community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, that's what I want to take on.
0.0	0.728030529659	Thousands of thousands -- you look at the number of companies and the number in terms of manufacturing of plans that we've lost -- 50,000 because of China.
0.0	0.381317503667	They have a sophisticated understanding of our legal immigration system and we now have an obligation to ensure that they are not able to use that system against us.
0.0	0.198279678944	You want to fix Medicare?
0.0	0.37426661025	But I promise you, in the state of South Carolina, they do.
0.0	0.269322519376	I want a government so small that the individual has a chance to thrive and prosper.
0.0	0.678720135427	In fact, Ronald Reagan's treasury, when Ronald Reagan's treasury looked at the vat tax, you know what they found?
0.0	0.576229601437	What I said was that I think that Dr. Carson's ideas are good ideas.
0.0	0.295320567258	And just to finish, people say, how will you get Mexico to pay?
0.0	0.349368143909	So let's demand open trade but fair trade in this country.
0.0	0.164229808685	No -- no...
0.0	0.355907267028	I know what it's like to owe that money, and we've worked hard.
0.0	0.433955646974	We ought to give them a little bit of a liability release so that they share data amongst themselves and share data with the federal government, they're not fearful of a lawsuit.
0.0	0.217110419081	Thank you all very much.
0.0	0.287828780613	They're not my ideas, and I don't necessarily agree with all of them.
0.0	0.232194477111	Sometimes you win a war by killing murderous, evil terrorists.
0.0	0.437216546206	And the fact of the matter is if we give them a mission and we don't tie their hands behind their back, they can get it accomplished.
0.0	0.232789614375	Can I tell you what?
0.0	0.395549631702	That is a bad deal and an evil situation, and presidents have looked the other way.
0.0	0.209062456772	Let me just say this.
0.0	0.691099799452	They see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on Wall Street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all.
0.0	0.214391212481	I don't care.
0.0	0.411581526165	We need to break the Washington cartel, and the only way to do it is to end all the subsidies and all...
1.0	0.651109198509	But I will -- but I will tell you this, the socialist says they're going to pay for everything and give you everything for free, except they don't say they're going to raise it through taxes to 90 percent to do it.
0.0	0.581208038916	...This is a matter not of math, this is a matter of morality.
0.0	0.526108770246	And I'll tell you one thing that we never talk about -- we haven't talked about it tonight.
