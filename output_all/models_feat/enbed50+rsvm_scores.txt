0.0	0.122954504011	We need to rebuild our families.
0.0	0.0223901772779	And you know what?
1.0	0.999999811644	But we have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977.
0.0	0.016344593788	OK?
0.0	0.249122668088	And people said "you can't win, you can't change the culture."
0.0	0.0127182595557	And guess what?
0.0	0.109795925631	We have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone.
0.0	0.271872362986	I've got a track record.
0.0	0.5	What happened with Atlantic City is very, very disgraceful.
0.0	0.18163634105	And yes, I am angry.
0.0	0.0998900259106	Well, I did.
0.0	0.675296083745	She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video.
0.0	0.17722737948	It's time for real substance and real experience.
0.0	0.210215785077	If you can encrypt messages, ISIS can, over these platforms, and we have no ability to have a cooperative relationship --
0.0	0.791822089179	And, it turns out that up until -- and this has blown me away, never in a million years would I have believed that I would be standing here tonight telling you that we have received three and a half million individual contributions from well over a million people.
0.0	0.55064962273	In fact, Ronald Reagan's treasury, when Ronald Reagan's treasury looked at the vat tax, you know what they found?
0.0	0.29752511288	I certainly agree with FDR for all the reasons Senator Sanders said.
0.0	0.534306311452	And then, after the war, this is the guy who, in fact, yes, you're right, he opened up relations with China, and now pushed various type of trade agreements, resulting in American workers losing their jobs as corporations moved to China.
0.0	0.486688036578	Senator Sanders, from a debate in 2008, quote what I said.
0.0	0.080641229564	But here's the best solution of all.
0.0	0.489899307749	I believe that we need to cut these taxes down, we need to be on a roadmap to balancing the budget, and we need to send power, money, and influence, the welfare department, the education department, job training, infrastructure, Medicaid, all of that out of Washington back to the states so we can run these programs from where we live to the top, not a one size fits all mentality that they have in Washington.
0.0	0.0342440310797	You know, I am by my nature impatient.
0.0	0.146751057767	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.242379461681	But let's be clear: Russia's aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO -- correctly, I believe -- are saying, you know what, we're going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action.
0.0	0.0897138494664	You count on it.
0.0	0.0438836842888	They're off to China.
0.0	0.159126965984	They look around for gun-free zones.
0.0	0.023331877265	And there should be some regulation.
0.0	0.106435157555	But we also need to reform Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.29605610675	And I believe that not only Barney Frank, Paul Krugman, and others, have said that what I have proposed is the most effective.
0.0	0.37437045357	As you know, he came to Vermont to campaign for me when he was a senator.
0.0	0.408836165816	It will lead to even greater war in this world.
0.0	0.142121261998	... an agreement with the...
0.0	0.226789430235	China is ripping us on trade.
0.0	0.288248534164	We do.
0.0	0.384962576594	Because what she will do is come in and she will raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.0561678877958	Well, it's interesting.
0.0	0.482546242722	I'm the only one on this stage that has a plan that would create jobs, cut taxes, balance the budget and can get it done because I'm realistic.
0.0	0.895933928241	The second point, it does not eliminate the corporate tax or the payroll tax.
0.0	0.153893694588	You know, of the few questions I've got, the last one I need is to give him some more time.
0.0	0.199880580454	We're running.
0.0	0.1590804847	I would hold a Camp David summit with our Arab allies, not to talk them into this lousy deal with Iran, but to say to them, "what is it that you need to defeat ISIL?"
0.0	0.713322204204	And we're going to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	0.0584875315309	I was a banker and I was proud of it.
0.0	0.142572403645	And I think Ted Kennedy had a very clear idea about what needed to be done.
0.0	0.343500947215	And, here's the difference between me and Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.246007087378	The people aren't dumb.
0.0	0.288248534164	I was not at all.
0.0	0.0789853040765	We also need a nominee, a candidate who will endorse our own principles.
0.0	0.0617832164527	It was a back sacrifice, and I have to hand it to Ben.
0.0	0.21991810107	I think he means somebody who hasn't been a career politician, and who's been out of office for awhile.
0.0	0.18059789889	Because -- because Donald's mother was born in Scotland.
0.0	0.110375797154	And -- and I guess I can -- can frame it another way.
0.0	0.273131997735	I changed that.
0.0	0.488881543234	We came back from the dead.
0.0	0.650645838119	I didn't get a phone call from Bill Clinton before I jumped in the race.
0.0	0.472028801952	I am a 2nd amendment person.
0.0	0.358222524643	Does he stand up for law enforcement?
0.0	0.941330933044	You can't get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year.
0.0	0.412577094189	I have a bill to fix Medicare.
0.0	0.167748277537	Well I want to comment on this.
0.0	0.246886302334	And -- and -- you know, the concept of New York values is not that complicated to figure out.
0.0	0.261454465086	Hardworking immigrant families living in fear, who should be brought out of the shadows so they and their children can have a better future.
0.0	0.542539652666	But I also think that these are very serious times; 75 percent of the American people think the federal government is corrupt.
0.0	0.396848684278	It will cause the economy to grow, to explode, to create more jobs.
0.0	0.406135688321	Companies should, if they want to attract the best workers, provide a good set of benefits.
0.0	0.316749298278	And I would not support those.
0.0	0.0722418810767	Reforms, everything from moral and cultural issues to economic issues.
0.0	0.657092327826	And I traveled the country and learned how people made jobs.
0.0	0.311062767502	But you ought to acknowledge the government doesn't do a very good job at it.
0.0	0.057290435977	They get -- they steal them.
0.0	0.454948170677	Yes, I believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on Wall Street, that they are a Wall Street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession -- Great Depression.
0.0	0.458506131902	We're going to bring jobs back from Japan, we're going to bring jobs back from China, we're going to bring, frankly, jobs back from Mexico where, as you probably saw, Nabisco is leaving Chicago with one of their biggest plants, and they're moving it to Mexico.
0.0	0.424666258518	And there's a bunch of things my tax plan does to help them.
1.0	0.875537176153	In 2008, Barack Obama missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes, and the same newspaper endorsed him again.
0.0	0.241459787808	The Europeans have moved on.
0.0	0.5	I've heard about tax schemes that don't add up, that put our kids in -- in a deeper hole than they are today.
0.0	0.21390383704	It was a coalition made up of Arabs and Americans and westerners and we're going to need it again.
0.0	0.016344593788	OK.
0.0	0.146424688036	I would just say this, we've heard a lot of great ideas up here, and I agree with what Senator Rubio said.
0.0	0.446123724104	We've laid out a national energy plan that says that we should invest in all types of energy.
0.0	0.0781178037468	How do we decide on who gets to follow up?
0.0	0.180080691518	Thanks for coming back to me, Maria.
0.0	0.0749541572665	You're right.
0.0	0.490070791998	This president, this president is more interested in funding -- less interested in funding the military, than he is in funding planned -- he's more interested in funding Planned Parenthood than he is in funding the military.
0.0	0.385089296107	What we have to do right now is bring our people together and understand that we must provide a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people.
0.0	0.721128550287	And we fought for statewide school choice, where the dollars follow the child, instead of the child following the dollars.
0.0	0.172824064303	I want a government so small that the individual has a chance to thrive and prosper.
0.0	0.193243949336	And also, I've been tested in a way no one else has.
0.0	0.255094861327	Now, we're going to blame the people.
0.0	0.836389654571	It increases the per child tax credit, because I didn't read about this in a book.
0.0	0.250743923937	Because, I've got to tell you the truth, even in New Jersey what you're doing is called rude.
0.0	0.178054395677	Now, what I think is that right now we have got to do our best in developing positive relations with Russia.
0.0	0.14695484954	... and sign an agreement that makes sure that the world knows that they will have technological superiority.
0.0	0.0948169247775	Well, John, I don't really have any weaknesses that I can think of.
0.0	0.0777869082224	I'd consider it.
0.0	0.359817241189	You know how many votes John McCain missed when he was carrying out that furious comeback that you're now modeling after?
0.0	0.639325459519	Eleven points, to be exact.
0.0	0.636952413275	When millions of Americans rose up against Planned Parenthood, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.082500595225	Maria, I assume that I can respond to that.
0.0	0.177963430358	I've got a very simple strategy as your president against ISIL.
0.0	0.261563145015	What I said was I don't believe that I would be president of the United States and have the same dysfunction that exists in Washington, D.C. now.
0.0	0.230050809178	And the reasons why I've done is I don't believe we have a good process of being able to vet them.
0.0	0.273422156915	And secondly, when you talk about me being on the board of Lehman Brothers, I wasn't on the board of Lehman Brothers.
0.0	0.0800951822325	And the idea that this negotiation -- I will tell you one thing.
0.0	0.0131839053468	That's what we need.
0.0	0.483708392569	We went after companies that were ripping off shareholders.
0.0	0.128344764997	I said right from the beginning that we should take no Syrian refugees of any kind.
1.0	0.265888259947	Now, on the floor of the Congress, the Washington establishment from both parties puts forward a bill that will explode the deficit.
0.0	0.221852839974	It's all about getting people to listen to one another's problems.
0.0	0.151369246688	It is why we have to simplify.
0.0	0.5	We can put America back on track on a growth level and a growth rate that we've never seen in the history of this country.
0.0	0.0353951314151	Look, here is the reality, folks.
0.0	0.205208150965	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.29380312708	The most powerful intelligence agency in the world is going to tell us where we are, the most powerful military in the world is going to destroy them.
0.0	0.850434450724	And by the way, the attack he keeps throwing out on the military budget, Marco knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion.
0.0	0.270646294357	I do not believe that we need to wholesale destroy every American citizen's privacy in order to go after those that we know are suspect or are -- are already a problem.
0.0	0.207220451074	I'm going to do it for America.
0.0	0.336778371066	I was on morning Joe at a town hall and a young student stood up and said, "Can I still be idealistic?"
0.0	0.466581120376	In fact, it's the chief argument by democrats against many of the different flat tax proposals.
0.0	0.337506884712	Well, let us level with the American people.
0.0	0.0385642826408	You can have him.
0.0	0.171480926853	If this all works out, I'm happy to consider naming you as V.P.
0.0	0.356160576835	My name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.335660493481	What this campaign is about is creating a process for a political revolution in which millions of Americans, working people who have given up on the political process, they don't think anybody hears their pains or their concerns.
0.0	0.447933690051	The most mistreated people.
0.0	0.263280654018	You know, America doesn't owe me anything.
0.0	0.178036933461	We need to be focusing on what fixes this country.
0.0	0.22733514383	And that's just not acceptable.
0.0	0.191762206646	It took -- it took an arm and a leg to be able to set up a 401(k).
0.0	0.166580322291	So I'm going to keep making that case.
0.0	0.0506471828702	But I guess I'm supposed to come out great.
0.0	0.505712573601	So what we do, though, is, if there is somebody who is price- gouging, we have laws for prosecutors to take that on.
0.0	0.836054085235	We will use those proceeds, a hundred billion a year, to invest in rebuilding our infrastructure.
0.0	0.784163685475	Businesses will now have to pay 16 percent on the money they make.
0.0	0.307649154032	But we're running for the presidency of the United States here.
0.0	0.229778018845	We have to continue to work with the Iraqi army so that they are better prepared to advance on some of the other strongholds inside Iraq, like Mosul, when they are able to do so.
0.0	0.417056209555	I'll tell you this, the number one job of the president of the United States is to protect the safety and security of the American people.
0.0	0.446753594518	Obamacare, we're going to repeal it and replace it.
0.0	0.134282685838	Well, I don't know if it's a blind trust if Ivanka, Don and Eric run it.
0.0	0.416754056942	I go further in the plan that I've proposed, which has been called the toughest, most effective, comprehensive plan for reining in the other risks that the financial system could face.
0.0	0.103868206211	I want a government so small I can barely see it.
0.0	0.466976497359	I would just say, I debated then Senator Obama numerous times on stages like this, and he was the recipient of the largest number of Wall Street donations of anybody running on the Democratic side ever.
0.0	0.0891110357503	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.00851543019341	Thank you.
0.0	0.0336050772692	That's an interesting question.
0.0	0.476284539759	This isn't the governments money.
0.0	0.239897949711	Big government favors the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected, and crushes the small and the powerless.
0.0	0.111406132343	I try to live by the rules, no matter what they are, and I was brought up that way as a kid.
0.0	0.460166295575	I think they made the Second Amendment the second amendment because they thought it was just that important.
0.0	0.169636560048	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.160747622481	You can't do nothing.
0.0	0.375661302351	Almost every hotel in Atlantic City has either been in bankruptcy or will be in bankruptcy -- the biggest.
0.0	0.26542207571	And that's why 2016 is a turning point in our history.
0.0	0.318927358552	It isn't law-abiding gun owners.
0.0	0.244702211328	We're going to create a border.
0.0	0.100439555148	And that's why Ronald Reagan said that it was a blindfold.
0.0	0.0683049342174	They're very concerned about it.
0.0	0.346281989221	The government is not supposed to be in every part of our lives, and that is what is causing the problem.
0.0	0.355892001798	If there's an act of violence in America, his immediate answer before he even knows the facts is gun control.
0.0	0.295449805601	And if I am president and we get our hands on him, he is standing trial for treason.
0.0	0.317702024646	He's a left-wing judicial activist, Harvard Law professor who was Al Gore's lawyer in Bush versus Gore.
1.0	0.963426022148	One, Senator Sanders voted in 1998 on what I think is fair to call a regime change resolution with respect to Iraq, calling for the end of Saddam Hussein's regime.
0.0	0.746333808605	The business flat tax, they already impose their taxes on us, so there's no reciprocal...
0.0	0.519518483384	I was very honored to be asked to do that and very honored to serve with him those first four years.
0.0	0.214013684881	It continues with regulatory reform.
0.0	0.0653802757341	We need to reform Social Security.
0.0	0.121764716552	It is a complicated relationship.
0.0	0.547896097848	But I'm not worried about my finances, I'm worried about the finances of everyday Americans who today are struggling in an economy that is not producing good paying jobs while everything else costs more.
0.0	0.166511984864	This is not entitlement, it's not welfare.
0.0	0.445235156238	I'm against the kind of inhumane treatment that is now being visited upon families, waking them up in the middle of the night, rounding them up.
0.0	0.63492908635	Last week, Secretary Carter announced that the Navy's going to be cut again.
0.0	0.268794348807	You can't do it with empty promised.
0.0	0.114456859557	I think you do have a humanitarian tragedy there, as I mentioned a moment ago.
0.0	0.275019600274	I mean the fact is, is that they need to put the pressure on and frankly we need to intercepts ships coming out of North Korea so they don't proliferate all these dangerous materials.
0.0	0.210026152089	And that's what I hear from some people, "we'll do nothing and it will just be fixed."
0.0	0.348929948544	And the world's financial system is on the verge of collapse.
0.0	0.165749880859	Lots of people will say lots of different things about me in this campaign and others, but the one thing they've never said about me is that I'm misunderstood.
0.0	0.385628259014	Well, that just wasn't -- that just wasn't the fact, Senator.
0.0	0.510566348734	Here's what I would do Neil, I would appoint an Attorney General and I would have one very brief conversation with that Attorney General.
0.0	0.214123497993	Look, the -- the deal is already done.
0.0	0.494067317849	In Louisiana, instead we're helping people getting better paying jobs so they can provide for their own health care.
0.0	0.0560190623722	This issue is not about that anymore.
0.0	0.117355614569	My parents in this country were able to give me the chance to do all the things they never did.
0.0	0.834760471544	Bring the money -- the $2 trillion -- back to the United States.
0.0	0.177590317237	And we have to take on ISIS online.
0.0	0.249202108518	And you think about the reasons that we're having such difficulty right now with our job market.
0.0	0.341027146367	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government in setting up -- retirement plans.
0.0	0.303228994353	That's why I've been leading the fight to stop it.
0.0	0.198581861858	So, are we going to ban Muslims from India, from Indonesia, from countries that are strong allies -- that we need to build better relationships with?
0.0	0.3413811878	But those kinds of personal assessments and charges are ones that I find particularly troubling.
0.0	0.174648093784	Where did that spirit come from in America?
0.0	0.38100836964	You know, you go to the internet, you start reading an article and you go to the comments section -- you cannot go five comments down before people are calling each all manner of names.
0.0	0.160324661706	Enough on fantasy football.
0.0	0.135748969268	Crony capitalism is what happens when government gets so big and so powerful that only the big and the powerful can handle it.
0.0	0.312924785937	But I would probably have my children run it with my executives and I wouldn't ever be involved because I wouldn't care about anything but our country, anything.
0.0	0.918966090367	This is a business flat tax.
0.0	0.244362902348	He wasn't my senator.
0.0	0.168649045642	We need to make sure that people understand, as Jeb said before, that if you've done extraordinarily well in this country, do you want them to take more out of your taxes now and think they're gonna give it back to you later?
0.0	0.895880077841	We've cut 26 percent of our budget.

0.0	0.375100311415	It's called the mainstream media who every single day...
0.0	0.178442838874	We have a lot of work to do with Iran before we ever say that they could move toward normalized relations with us.
0.0	0.0892084190664	Well, I want to know, did you win?
0.0	0.4384071124	I'd like to just mention something about my tax plan, and how it relates to the discussion...
0.0	0.153674518159	... who got us out of that...
0.0	0.34682959997	I want to speak to all our fighting men and women.
0.0	0.0395219523694	Right.
0.0	0.38086456597	I'm interested in making sure we get the maximum amount of revenue from those who can well afford to provide it.
0.0	0.283740594848	We need somebody ready to be commander-in-chief on day one, who understands there are no moderates in Iran, they've been killed a long time ago.
0.0	0.515382982269	Our country is being run by incompetent people.
0.0	0.127250633187	They don't want them made here.
0.0	0.377972213345	It requires tax cuts, because that sends a message to the job creators that things are headed the right way.
0.0	0.0200447011701	I like it.
0.0	0.792140853996	Where basically, businesses now will have to pay a tax, both on the money they make, but they also have to pay taxes on the money that they pay their employees.
0.0	0.629840529734	We inherited a system that was set up during World War II; 170 million Americans get health insurance right now through their employers.
0.0	0.0463182207813	Check it out.
0.0	0.757293191532	It enables us to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	0.151313569992	And I just couldn't agree -- disagree more with those kinds of comments.
0.0	0.5	Yes, I do believe that now after the American people bailed Wall Street out, yes, they should pay a Wall Street speculation tax so that we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.879179488961	and they decide, we're going to raise it to 30 percent, plus we're going to raise the income tax to 30 percent.
0.0	0.20085439447	And I'll tell you what a weakness is of this country: there are a lot of people who are sick and tired because Washington does not play by the same rules that the American people have to play by.
0.0	0.251893447979	You know, I think, again, both of us share the goal of trying to make college affordable for all young Americans.
0.0	0.0668306701696	It's never been that way in American politics before.
0.0	0.691522520539	Sometimes it's because the Federal Reserve kept interest rates so low that the wealthy were able to invest in -- in strong assets like the stock market when everybody else was left behind.
0.0	0.278996635927	We're going to be tough at the border, we're going to be tough on all of the illegal immigrants that everybody else in this field -- we're going to be different.
0.0	0.350391463189	We need to incent private savings and make sure that Social Security is protected for those that have it.
0.0	0.600213381245	... in addition to that, we go ahead and we take the oil from them, their source of revenue.
0.0	0.0109179260055	We need a doer, not a talker.
1.0	0.999999920912	We're spending $80 billion a year locking up fellow Americans.
0.0	0.0436076122242	And that's why I think these ideas up here are great, and that's what we should have is have more discussions like this and less gotcha.
0.0	0.269417610033	And if you can't use the term, you're never going to solve the problem.
0.0	0.230445941836	We need someone to fight for the people.
0.0	0.231040127512	The American people are never going to trust Washington, D.C., and for good reason.
0.0	0.30197661691	And they came back with 23 recommendations.
0.0	0.432691268677	The American people have rejected your agenda and now you're trying to go around it.
0.0	0.565733155383	We've been the most pro-life state six years in a row.
0.0	0.203780740034	And I think when you give low-income kids -- African-American, white, Latino kids -- the opportunities to get their lives together, they are not going to end up in jail.
0.0	0.541776755866	Because that person should not have gotten a gun, should not -- would not have passed a background check.
0.0	0.829962918775	No, it's your record.
0.0	0.214719242562	We are in a war against ISIS.
0.0	0.00851543019341	Thank you.
0.0	0.760645109354	That's my bill.
0.0	0.223334075349	But the facts and the law here are really quite clear.
0.0	0.219234471133	We used to win, we don't win anymore.
0.0	0.31967029146	America is back in the leadership business.

0.0	0.0867759563171	Let me be clear.
0.0	0.184579650663	Well, to start with, unlike President Obama, I'll actually name the enemy that we confront.
0.0	0.124104444771	And that's why, as president, I will look at communities that need special help and try to deliver that.
0.0	0.101774977231	The Republican Party is blessed to have 11 good candidates, (inaudible) 10 good candidates.
1.0	0.803737384113	1.5 million jobs created during the worst economic time this country has had since the Great Depression while the rest of the country lost 400,000 jobs.
0.0	0.116380234406	I look at Washington, and I hear the talk, and I see the promises and it seems nothing ever changes.
0.0	0.104920828423	We haven't.
0.0	0.174193770392	But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work.
0.0	0.470072954719	I don't remember you ever complaining about John McCain's vote record.
0.0	0.322128760203	And so everybody needs to discount some of the things you're going to hear in these ads, and discount the -- the back-and-forth here, because every person here is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.605310019601	The truth is that sentencing for blacks is higher than for whites.
0.0	0.414945973813	Run the company kids, have a good time.
0.0	0.611075772956	Yes, I thought about running four years ago.
0.0	0.268810742393	I believe this is still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.22027362697	We need to embed with -- with the Iraqi military.
0.0	0.0662229803769	Ever.
0.0	0.00653698805144	We have to be honest about it.
0.0	0.223821117649	I absolutely would call on them to collaborate and cooperate, yes.
0.0	0.258406395998	Now, let me just be clear, John.
1.0	0.528711812456	And they've stolen from you because now they know they cannot pay these benefits and Social Security is going to be insolvent in seven to eight years.
0.0	0.33347089112	We both agree that we have to get unaccountable money out of our political system and that we have to do much more to ensure that Wall Street never wrecks main street again.
0.0	0.288248534164	No -- no...
0.0	0.456960589593	Because so many people in my family worked in steel mills, and they didn't work with a white collar, they worked in a blue collar.
0.0	0.162146304507	When it comes to ISIS, we will not weaken them, we will not degrade them, we will utterly and completely destroy ISIS
0.0	0.310446519826	As a result of his efforts and the efforts of Joe Biden against unprecedented, I was there in the Senate, unprecedented Republican obstructionism, we have made enormous progress.
0.0	0.434255812785	And the last piece is this.
0.0	0.323539031131	And when countries violate trade agreements or dump product in this country, we need -- we need to stand up against those countries that do that without making them into an enemy.
0.0	0.251529397125	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.679342970047	After those four years of looking back and being prepared, the preparation to be the most powerful individual in the world requires an extraordinary amount of work: not just having been the governor of the 12th largest economy in the world, which I might add, we added 1.5 million jobs during that period of time over that 2007 through 2014 period, a period when America was going through the most deep recession it had been through since the Great Depression.
0.0	0.12919530705	He got lucky with fracking.
0.0	0.515341558954	Until we have a president of the United States that gets up every day and goes to the Oval Office with the intent purpose of securing that border, and there's not anybody on either one of these stages that has the experience of dealing with this as I have for over 14 years with that 1200-mile border.
0.0	0.124612252327	I think President Obama has set a great example.
0.0	0.311542969666	And, look, I think it's important to look at what the most important counterterrorism judgment of the first four years of the Obama administration was, and that was the very difficult decision as to whether or not to advise the president to go after bin Laden.
0.0	0.0646654924387	The Koch Brothers have a very clear political agenda.
0.0	0.295729267421	Let the states do this.
0.0	0.127444500219	I guess just for the fun of it; they want to throw money around.
0.0	0.249116389322	Well, if the law would change, yeah.
0.0	0.5	I'm in favor of people coming into this country legally.
0.0	0.458643734209	Well, as you know, I'm a former elected prosecutor, a former elected attorney general, trained at the University of Virginia in constitutional law, and I don't believe in litmus tests except this.
0.0	0.0705764877411	What I said was that I think that Dr. Carson's ideas are good ideas.
0.0	0.390117528652	They know that this country is pushing the middle class, the hardworking taxpayers, backwards, and they saw a president who doesn't understand their pain, and doesn't have any plan for getting away from it.
0.0	0.17642976433	Look, the truth is that a powerful nation like the United States, certainly working with our allies, we can overthrow dictators all over the world.
0.0	0.289341057615	I have worked for his re-election.
0.0	0.30773563674	We warned about the 9/11 attack before the 9/11 attack occurred.
0.0	0.550968855549	And as Reagan demonstrated, if we cut taxes, we can bring back growth.
0.0	0.680842590188	Right now, you don't have the -- you have taxes that are too high.
0.0	0.242612331689	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.267438979795	You didn't see these kind of ideas being batted around, and being batted around in a way that's civil and smart and that's trying to help to inform the voter out there.
0.0	0.253248945664	I think maybe my greatest weakness is that I trust people too much.
0.0	0.357588650723	Are you coming onboard a proposal?
0.0	0.233368590152	He is undermining our standing in the world.
0.0	0.458239201139	And this is one of the myths that the left perpetrates on our society, and this is how they frighten people and get people to shut up.
0.0	0.378975033169	I stood on the stage and watched Marco in rather indignantly, look at Governor Bush and say, someone told you that because we're running for the same office, that criticizing me will get you to that office.
0.0	0.510185357253	We have to obey the laws.
0.0	0.259281085269	Corporate inversion is one of the biggest problems we have.
0.0	0.189692968524	We've already got a great talker in the White House.
0.0	0.301357960678	And Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will say it's those evil rich people.
0.0	0.190248878544	Make our streets safe again.
0.0	0.187817844126	But I'm going to tell you the truth.
0.0	0.471217980504	This is the same old stuff since I left.
0.0	0.331939715143	I propose to reverse that and get this economy moving again.
1.0	0.999994491442	We have the highest rate of childhood poverty among almost any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.553550941205	That's not why I ran for office.
0.0	0.151886994376	My Muslim friends, some, said, "thank you very much; we'll get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.285268111934	If you're running for president of the United States and you don't understand that we need more American ground forces in Iraq and that America has to be part of a regional ground force that will go into Syria and destroy ISIL in Syria, then you're not ready to be commander in chief.
0.0	0.14943597947	It will be a way of life.
0.0	0.471638172348	I have Ryan Tannehill, Marco, as my quarterback, he was 18 for 19 last week.
0.0	0.486142392704	That's right, three pages.
0.0	0.78676091056	My tax plan enables you to fill out your taxes on a postcard so we can abolish the IRS.
0.0	0.146682169718	Why don't you wait in line?
0.0	0.708829048593	And I would note the Senate just a few weeks ago voted to suspend refugees from Middle Eastern countries.
0.0	0.0524256504858	Neil...
0.0	0.259367850479	First and foremost, this issue has to be now more than anything else about keeping America safe.
0.0	0.417621692588	When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York.
0.0	0.423271304096	What we need now is a proven leader who has produced results.
0.0	0.275412225334	Putting Iranian troops right on the border of the Golan right next to Israel would be a nonstarter for me.
0.0	0.422206434389	Well, Secretary Clinton, you're not in the White House yet.
0.0	0.1445437954	I think, actually, people are looking for that in Washington now.
0.0	0.313608137835	First of all, Nikki this afternoon said I'm a friend of hers.
0.0	0.0133991170049	Here's the thing.
1.0	0.955751963112	We borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.0620345394151	You know, everyone here talks about the need to take on Washington.
0.0	0.288798721889	So, let's stop fooling around about this, let's tell people the truth.
0.0	0.0619726639414	Next, we have to talk to our adversaries, and we have to make sure they understand the limits of our patience.
0.0	0.303467954697	Today, many of us picked up our newspapers, and we were horrified to see the sight of 10 American sailors on their knees, with their hands on their heads.
0.0	0.267581934901	I'm not anti-Wall Street, but I don't believe the government ought to wear a team jersey, pick winners and losers.
0.0	0.0712256172742	They go to Princeton.
0.0	0.253724638282	The simple fact is that the world has been torn asunder.
0.0	0.108588502107	That's gonna be the real growth engine.
0.0	0.370540658105	The simple fact is one of the ways, Maria, to solve the problem you described is narrow the number of people coming by family petitioning to what every other country has so that we have the best and the brightest that come to our country.
0.0	0.452293976905	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.253780790009	And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, because I've been a leader on these issues.
0.0	0.263505869907	I would also just say this.
0.0	0.0840849997668	I got that.
0.0	0.251529397125	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.130181891923	I'm not blaming Chris, by the way, but he will know about that.
0.0	0.306181995722	And you had better get rid of them, because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.146224443517	We had a decision to make early on, do we do a Super PAC?
1.0	0.999982108123	He put a 25 million dollar check up from his own pocket to fund that campaign and my wife Heidi and I, we ended up investing everything we owned.
1.0	0.352848000078	I didn't have an involvement with them.
0.0	0.476150488085	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.189592513022	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.220048318457	They say, " well, we don't really have control."
0.0	0.0751866438836	I mean, just think about a scenario like that.
0.0	0.0599969784884	You bet they do.
0.0	0.46015622546	A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to go on a congressional delegation.
0.0	0.528822400732	And I said, "Didn't you resent America for not letting you be with your father in those formative and very threatening years?"
0.0	0.0284031483032	But I know who the pessimist is.
0.0	0.296043196282	And finally, on health care, why don't we start treating -- keep giving...
0.0	0.425776259824	Guaranteeing that women's work finally gets the pay, the equal pay that we deserve.
0.0	0.268102650133	That is very different than talking about specific action for regime change, which I did not support.
0.0	0.420259289734	Are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the Assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire?
0.0	0.0761274914016	I will tell you that.
0.0	0.183161892821	Well, with respect to Syria, I really do appreciate the efforts that Secretary Kerry has made.
0.0	0.92153269546	Our average contribution is $27 dollars, I'm very proud of that.
0.0	0.348722063945	ISIL is trying to create themselves into a new state.
0.0	0.607421254102	The reality is four times as many blacks get arrested for marijuana.
0.0	0.0981954608437	So count me in as somebody who will not be listening to Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.129641925905	This is a great nation.
0.0	0.492919073499	And Senator Sanders's plan really rests on making sure that governors like Scott Walker contribute $23 billion on the first day to make college free.
0.0	0.664264014729	Now in terms of their really stunning hit piece, what they mentioned is when I was running for senate -- unlike Hillary Clinton, I don't have masses of money in the bank, hundreds of millions of dollars.
0.0	0.206260734624	You know, I sat down with the senior leadership of John Deere.
0.0	0.339893683296	I would sign an executive order protecting religious liberty, our first amendment rights, so Christian business owners and individuals don't face discrimination for having a traditional view of marriage.
0.0	0.219655756324	Number -- and that is important for you to know.
0.0	0.277133019445	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you had better get rid of the super PACs, because they're causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that are being made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.370507138584	You know, as I said already twice in this debate, we have a very serious problem in this country.
0.0	0.0902113757289	They don't like that.
0.0	0.288248534164	How about this?
0.0	0.18004864343	And I ask everyone in America to call Congress tomorrow and say enough is enough; no more debt.
0.0	0.226769108344	He doesn't meet -- here's the difference.
0.0	0.5	And I just want to say, you know, last week we released our tax plan.
0.0	0.0103650661443	A Republican Congress did that.
0.0	0.302267335707	John Kasich, will you insult two people over here?
0.0	0.258948923358	Ohio, one of the best growing places in the country -- I not only did it in Washington, I did it in Ohio, and I'll go back to Washington, and there will be no more silly deals...
0.0	0.142274114163	The truth is this, the big problem, we need a leader in Washington who understands how to get something done, not to talk about it, not to propose it, to get it done.
0.0	0.303545093291	I've a bill to fix Social Security.
0.0	0.307134869014	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.0862229592462	See, they don't like that.
0.0	0.346098758857	Let me tell you that, in this country -- in this country, people are concerned about their economic future.
0.0	0.280976013077	... they don't like the Wall Street Journal.
0.0	0.170490850975	And so when we talk to our allies and we give them our word, in a Christie administration, they know we're going to keep it.
0.0	0.0254512654394	I like Marco Rubio.
0.0	0.148933773609	They didn't do that either.
0.0	0.26612127943	That's the truth of the matter and you see it every time with this president.
0.0	0.611436476509	Both Democrats and Republicans have gotten us in the mess we're in -- $18 trillion of debt, a bad deal with Iran, we're not staying with Israel.
0.0	0.130859674045	I believe that we have got to move toward a path toward citizenship.
0.0	0.159256774359	I am a conservative; I can win this job, I can do this job, I need your help, I need your support.
0.0	0.190652319662	Good question, but I want to tell you, my great concern is that we are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job.
0.0	0.345238890717	And in that meeting, I suggested we had a problem with technology, and that I wanted to take people from Silicon Valley into the Pentagon to solve our most significant problems.

0.0	0.381142724432	But realistically, even if they do, the money is flowing.
0.0	0.45815486779	And what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice.
0.0	0.16961732149	And by those standards, we're not doing particularly well.

1.0	0.454466779943	Becky, it is the height of hypocrisy for Mrs. Clinton to talk about being the first woman President, when every single policy she espouses, and every single policy of President Obama has been demonstrably bad for women.

0.0	0.245020933523	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.131025840827	I believe in the PTT because it's important those countries in Asia are interfacing against China.

0.0	0.515130903003	We have a country of laws.
0.0	0.284661201569	You see, because if you really want to get to a balanced budget, you need to reduce your expenses and you need to grow your economy.
0.0	0.303380608947	And that's how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America.
0.0	0.895400547877	Let me just say, if you're talking about an $18 trillion economy, you're talking about a 15 percent tax on your gross domestic product.
0.0	0.492277593536	But all of my career, you know, having been raised in -- by a mailman father whose father was a coal miner, who died of black lung and was losing his eyesight; or a mother whose mother could barely speak English.
0.0	0.878061271429	So beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given -- bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money.
0.0	0.141438824038	My mother is on Medicare and Social Security.

0.0	0.422620842835	I started the Gang of Seven, and it led to the overtaking of the 40-year Democratic rule of Congress, because I didn't -- I stood up to the old-boy network in Washington, D.C. because I believed that Washington was not the solution, that Washington was the problem, just like Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.328195438985	None of these instances that the president points to as the reason why he's doing these things would have been preventive.
0.0	0.0112899405601	Yeah.
0.0	0.135438944847	Well, let me tell you this.
0.0	0.357948283837	It just needs a corporate executive type at the top that's done it before.
0.0	0.576731087763	So it's not just the government -- the private sector companies, it's also our own government that needs to raise the level of our game.
0.0	0.137608070178	Listen, I want to just comment.
0.0	0.645740799718	I can tell you, after spending seven years as a former federal prosecutor, right after 9/11, dealing with this issue.
0.0	0.514918395995	We have 30,000 fewer state bureaucrats than the day I took office.
0.0	0.203876491686	Every time he's got a chance, going all the way back to -- remember that Great Beer Summit he had after he messed up that time.
0.0	0.589328635609	I saw you on the Senate floor flip your vote on crop insurance because they told you it would help you in Iowa, and last week, we all saw you flip your vote on ethanol in Iowa for the same reason.
0.0	0.216881754687	And we need to do that throughout the country.
0.0	0.374244320464	I am, but people are upset, and they're upset for a reason about the future of this country.
0.0	0.483616425356	And if you're going to leave this to Hillary Clinton, the person who gave us this foreign policy, the architect of it, and you're going to give her another four years, that's why I'm speaking out as strongly as I am about that.
0.0	0.156795267167	So let's start -- let's start with immigration.
0.0	0.0769912977377	Look, I think we are readier than we used to be, but it's a constant effort that has to be undertaken to make sure we are as ready as we need to be.
0.0	0.45294825997	But I promise you, in the state of South Carolina, they do.
0.0	0.478568513545	They are much more than that.
0.0	0.347388812629	The agreement on humanitarian relief now needs to be implemented, because there are enclaves that are literally filled with starving people throughout Syria.
1.0	0.992508834313	Look, I have an A plus rating in the NRA and we also have a reduction in gun violence because in Florida, if you commit a crime with a gun, you're going away.
0.0	0.212841042985	That's what I said.
0.0	0.362945446292	You know, I have said -- I have said many times, you know, I'm not asking people to support me because I'm a woman.
0.0	0.164601596886	This president and John Kerry and Hillary Clinton all have made it harder for the next president to act, but he must act to confront the ambitions of Iran.
0.0	0.00851543019341	Thank you.
0.0	0.290272847176	It isn't "I put money in, I'm getting it back."
0.0	0.250000857549	And the fact of the matter is if we give them a mission and we don't tie their hands behind their back, they can get it accomplished.
0.0	0.23904092203	I think it's a mistake to create new and more expensive entitlement programs when we can't afford the ones we've got today.
0.0	0.517148699501	Change the Mexico City policy, not take one dime of taxpayer money to fund abortion organizations overseas, and restore the NSA that's been gutted.
0.0	0.12214761281	Here's the bottom line.
0.0	0.828523915626	There have been more than 4,000 changes to the tax plan since 2001 alone.
0.0	0.492061824677	They're working as hard as they ever have, everything costs more, and they haven't had a raise in decades.
0.0	0.924832612279	I built a net worth of way over $10 billion, and I have done it four times out of hundreds.
1.0	0.344339242079	And he says, the president's appointee, that crime is going up because of this.
0.0	0.400769794577	And just to finish, people say, how will you get Mexico to pay?
0.0	0.272924887023	... the best results, wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.572091768019	But for that Texas police officer, we could have had a mass murder.
0.0	0.368551518546	Here is where we are with public education.
0.0	0.490530327142	I do believe that in the year 2016 we have to look in terms of public education as colleges as part of public education making public colleges and universities tuition free.
0.0	0.119222906284	It's why you see the banks consolidating.
0.0	0.214947872527	You know, I have two sons.
0.0	0.162308294933	How can you run for the Republican nomination and be for single- payer health care?
0.0	0.00851543019341	Thank you.
0.0	0.0223901772779	And you know what?
0.0	0.211155588478	You know, I completely agree with Senator Sanders.
0.0	0.150357194913	It's not fair trade.
0.0	0.251066490823	Well, first of all, recognize it is a substantial problem.
0.0	0.363978745219	We have been talking about it for decades.
0.0	0.133530026302	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.128209583176	And we have to take properly vetted refugees ourselves.
0.0	0.314966618447	I have no clue whether the federal government is the proper place, my instinct is to say, hell no, just about everything about the federal government.
0.0	0.357837883761	America was worth the wait.
0.0	0.293688460679	Donald is right that China is running over President Obama like he is a child, President Obama is not protecting American workers and we are getting hammered.
0.0	0.156237183796	Thank you, senator.
0.0	0.239674985664	I mean, literally, the Senate -- what is it, like a French work week?
0.0	0.190436845359	No, they don't like he beats the rest of the field, because they want me.
0.0	0.5	I have yet to see a proposal that you're describing that the -- raising the cap would apply to passive income.
0.0	0.440400058521	Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the co-chair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat.
0.0	0.323424420422	We're a country of laws, not of men, not of people who do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.284510461436	It was some of the most progressive members of the United States Congress who opposed it for that reason.
0.0	0.191285344145	That's just a fact, and that's what Donald Trump taps into.
0.0	0.0380748026027	And this is not an endeavor that rewards that.
0.0	0.421360507639	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.0782887487383	They're protectionist.
0.0	0.271765469216	There's nobody out there looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.383904923282	A rich person does not.
0.0	0.227172587137	He is not the only one.
0.0	0.19556121854	Martha, religious liberty doesn't include encouraging a fellow American to engage in violent jihad and kill an American here.
0.0	0.310851232091	I'll tell them that we're going to grow the economy so that we can give people better opportunities so they don't have to rely exclusively on benefit types of programs.
0.0	0.134829456248	Can I just add one very quick thing?
0.0	0.11462415668	I will not shock anybody to suggest that in politics there is occasionally a little bit of hypocrisy.
0.0	0.198753827991	We don't have a health care crisis in America, we have a health crisis.
0.0	0.287575302137	They are -- they're in a position where they're smothering people.
0.0	0.0303430182373	It's a joke.
0.0	0.483547971745	Now, the proposal that I have outlined, you know, should be familiar to you, because it is what essentially Barack Obama campaigned on in 2008.
0.0	0.0932092508397	Good at email.
0.0	0.104186484623	I find -- I mean, it's just a very different, you know, historical perspective here.
0.0	0.158043718274	I never said that.
0.0	0.447399055056	That is the way we deal with global warming, climate change, or any of those problems, not through government intervention, not through government taxes, and for God's sake, don't send Washington another dime until they stop wasting the money they're already sending there.
1.0	0.999999999975	Median wages have stagnated.
0.0	0.0601750281673	I promise.
0.0	0.805731651924	When I was running for senate just about every lobbyist, just about all of the establishment opposed me in the senate race in Texas and my opponent in that race was worth over 200 million dollars.
0.0	0.474400528558	If I become President because we'll have a Constitutional Amendment to require a federally balanced budget so they will do their job.
0.0	0.41673921071	When I was 22, my dad died.
0.0	0.154283130485	No, I think the idea was that president -- then-Senator Obama was wrong for suggesting that it is a good idea to talk to your opponents.
0.0	0.467797861097	And frankly, it just came out, and in Iowa now, as you know, Ted, in the last three polls, I'm beating you.
0.0	0.427404115408	And just so -- if I could, because he insulted a lot of people.
0.0	0.223858737668	He just writes out an order, executive order.
0.0	0.139801509879	We are not the world's policeman, but we need to stand up and be ready.
0.0	0.271986138047	And some of them, I will say, not all, have called me and said, "Donald, thank you very much; you're exposing an unbelievable problem and we have to get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.00413362602821	Wait for what?
0.0	0.256344483028	We have to shut down, whether or not they're in prisons preaching or on -- in mosques preaching.
0.0	0.31989548575	You'll see me on the floor of the Senate tomorrow filibustering this and saying enough is enough, no more debt.
0.0	0.142636516838	For once, let's do that, and stop trying to give them some kind of fantasy that's never going to come true.
0.0	0.0734193936195	Maria, Neil, thank you for a great debate tonight.
0.0	0.394068165151	When I was in Washington, I fought to get the budget balanced.
0.0	0.203076513649	I'm running for president because there is no way we can elect Hillary Clinton to continue the policies of Barack Obama.
0.0	0.157064903512	And for the life of me, I have no understanding why the president thinks that everything is going well.
0.0	0.5	I don't know if people understand, but I spent a lifetime with my colleagues getting us to a federal balanced budget.
0.0	0.164596848102	Martha, we got a lot of politicians that will kiss babies, cut ribbons, do whatever it takes to be popular.
1.0	0.99999917718	When President Obama came into office we were losing 800,000 jobs a month, 800,000 jobs a month.
0.0	0.697639095788	He's got probably a four or five percent chance.
0.0	0.269487767353	People are waking up because it is going to be us who will determine the direction of our country.
0.0	0.255569387814	Why should we let their people be sitting there smoking their cigars, sitting in their comfortable chairs in Raqqa?
0.0	0.0559783914686	We need to get realistic about this.
0.0	0.127651305216	Work requirements and time limits.
0.0	0.137278931414	And I will go back to Washington with my plan.
0.0	0.182247479718	No, that's -- you're wrong.
1.0	0.952807491473	First of all, I didn't support Sonia Sotomayor.
0.0	0.407282884914	We have a president of the United States that is undermining this country's security and expanding the role of...
0.0	0.5429909339	The Egyptians have asked us to share intelligence.
0.0	0.478403200743	We can't just allow it to continue on its current path the way that Hillary Clinton wants to do because there'll be major reductions in benefits in the next decade if we do nothing.
0.0	0.0427551670771	So, you know, we'll take our progress wherever we can find it.
0.0	0.13002287227	Listen, we -- this is the greatest country in the history of mankind.
0.0	0.0908204521383	But let me say one more thing.
0.0	0.0118263381463	It is not a suggestion.
0.0	0.153795601198	Come with me to Iraq and Afghanistan, folks.
1.0	0.922727463156	Well, there's not question that we should be able to look at past president whether they're married to somebody who's running for president or not in terms of their past behavior and what it means.
0.0	0.147241530963	And by the way, Jeb you mentioned Boeing, take a look.
0.0	0.291623278425	We haven't done so.
0.0	0.0216132376232	About Medicare?
0.0	0.263218232056	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.164496087353	Now, the challenge we're seeing today is that the Supreme Court is being converted into some type of political body.
0.0	0.167160465239	And it's important that people really look hard at what the threats and dangers we face are, and who is best prepared for dealing with them.
0.0	0.992850380099	$19 billion of tax cuts, 1.3 million jobs created.
0.0	0.134705168475	So I know Secretary Kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease-fire up as quickly as possible.
0.0	0.0154493638128	So I have voiced criticisms.
0.0	0.0714069569507	I think if it doesn't...
0.0	0.517817616388	Absolutely, because what we will do is say, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so they're not hanging out on street corners.
0.0	0.218621358778	But they can't get along.
0.0	0.121946829098	I'll tell you how optimistic I am about America.
0.0	0.147999686734	There's something going on and it's bad.
0.0	0.243765387715	I've lived my whole life fighting -- fighting for things that I believe in, fighting for justice and to protect people from crime and terrorism, fighting to stand up for folks who have not had enough and need an opportunity to get more, and to stand up and fight against the special interests.
0.0	0.646629512308	Well, and specifically to Medicare, Becky, because 85 percent of the cost of Medicare is chronic disease.
0.0	0.165525762632	... you're not going to have peace in Syria with Assad in charge.
0.0	0.163510527816	is exactly the leadership we need in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.485292559031	We don't have procurement being done for refreshing the equipment.
0.0	0.128738792909	And I ask you to join me in truth and honesty and integrity.

0.0	0.0649429214075	Well, I would really appreciate that.
0.0	0.203473776911	You didn't see it for a minute.
0.0	0.0250543687581	I have no idea.
1.0	0.5	We have 400,000 small businesses forming every year in this country.
0.0	0.169636560048	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.255845032976	We have got to demilitarize local police departments so they do not look like occupying armies.

0.0	0.288248534164	No.
0.0	0.285772306401	Also, when you look at these videos, they are horrific and show just a hideous disrespect for life.
0.0	0.293093104363	Under that theory, not only would I be disqualified, Marco Rubio would be disqualified, Bobby Jindal would be disqualified and, interestingly enough, Donald J. Trump would be disqualified.
0.0	0.368038902829	Well, first of all the -- the plan gives people the option of -- of opting out.
0.0	0.329979123231	Because they're recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees.
0.0	0.0600118536894	That's how you make peace in the world.

0.0	0.254898731409	It's extraordinarily wrong.
0.0	0.406449751004	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.198766109729	You cannot make rash statements and expect the rest of the world to respond as though, well, it's just politics.
0.0	0.288248534164	We have Dodd-Frank.

0.0	0.927003829387	We pay federal taxes.
0.0	0.147310701553	You have got to pick somebody who has experience, somebody that has the know-how, the discipline.
0.0	0.624256812792	You know, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took the oath of office in 1933 at a time when 25 percent of the American people were unemployed, country was in incredible despair.
0.0	0.197836848153	But you know, we don't want to put everybody in the same category.
0.0	0.173076617519	If we don't stop them over there, they are coming here just as sure as I stand here in front of you.
1.0	0.447402079094	We stuck to the fact that Americans are tired of Washington corporate interests and Democrats who are interested in just politics and power and they're looking for someone who's going to fight for them; looking for someone who's going to grow manufacturing sector of our economy, so those 74 percent of Americans who don't have a college degree have a chance to rise again.
0.0	0.111766914261	But, let me tell you who not to blame.
0.0	0.473198310556	We used to have 16 workers for one retiree, now you have three workers for one retiree.
0.0	0.301312230768	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
1.0	0.990924145457	One out of five Americans can't even afford the prescriptions their doctors are writing.
0.0	0.42393561071	I know that we are at greater risk today than at any time since then of another attack.
0.0	0.189415631621	I looked at the evidence.
0.0	0.343749448253	You know, she only had a third-grade education, but -- you know, she knew how to stretch a dollar.
0.0	0.248326718703	I think now what I've called for is counsel for every child so that no child has to face any kind of process without someone who speaks and advocates for that child so that the right decision hopefully can be made.
0.0	0.27363909498	I will do everything I can to make certain that the United States and our brave men and women in the military do not get bogged down in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.
0.0	0.0933043855003	We hear a lot of good plans.
0.0	0.288248534164	No.
0.0	0.225353858492	It's got great people, it's got loving people, wonderful people.
0.0	0.488306334104	But I knew that good people who wanted to be a part of the American dream have become trapped in dependency because the federal government and the state government had made it in their economic interest not to take a job because the benefits that they didn't work were better.
0.0	0.5	And the people in New York fought and fought and fought, and we saw more death, and even the smell of death -- nobody understood it.
0.0	0.837179213595	...One more time, in Ohio, our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.134801955666	And, they're always going to say, "Well, we're going to fix this one day."
0.0	0.360346439525	And if you elect me president, we will bring incredible growth back to this country.
0.0	0.398748842731	You lead and you produce results.
0.0	0.158134790551	Do we have answer for that?
1.0	0.853591850249	You know, I left my medical practice and ran for office because I was concerned about an $18 trillion debt.
0.0	0.378782588047	This issue now has to be about stopping ISIS entering the United States, and when I'm president we will.
0.0	0.346826919482	That's why George Romney, Mitt's dad, was eligible to run for president, even though he was born in Mexico.
0.0	0.288248534164	No.
0.0	0.213256256357	You know, before it was called Obamacare, it was called Hillarycare.
0.0	0.336756340076	If I am president of the United States, we're going to send soldiers back to Iraq, back to Syria, to keep us from being attacked here and keep soldiers in Afghanistan because we must.
0.0	0.883957591105	It's a 20 percent flat rate tax, it'll take a blowtorch to the -- to the IRS.
0.0	0.288248534164	...
0.0	0.477268996644	Half of American seniors would be in poverty without a Social Security check.
0.0	0.288248534164	No.
0.0	0.0798727482137	You had only 21 Republican governors in this country.
0.0	0.208663611232	Let me (inaudible).
0.0	0.420567690752	But Maria, radical Islamic terrorism was not invented 24 months ago; 24 months ago, we had Al Qaida.
0.0	0.0590812691811	Not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.197941277586	But I think I'll go back to building buildings if it doesn't work out.
0.0	0.114057891726	Nobody can solve it like me.
0.0	0.234860760034	Our greatest days lie ahead if we are willing to do what it takes now.
0.0	0.236738532875	Maybe we would've gotten a deal where we didn't give everything away.
0.0	0.343615265974	Now I think an area in kind of a vague way, or not so vague, where Secretary Clinton and I disagree is the area of regime change.
0.0	0.805641193668	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.168113600813	We can take many of those same procedures, we can apply it to Medicare.
0.0	0.21777690597	It'll be a pretty busy day, but that Iran negotiation is going to be torn up on day one.
0.0	0.843983895217	So yes, I will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year pay zero, zero in federal income tax.
0.0	0.206013089681	Crony capitalism is alive and well, and has been so in Washington, D.C. for decades.
0.0	0.115698011361	Government causes a problem, and then government steps in to solve the problem.
0.0	0.273245300868	And I will have done it within 100 days, and it will pass.
0.0	0.211626353098	Terrorism is on the run, China, Russia is advancing their agenda at warp speed, and we pull back.
0.0	0.852611159942	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.138220370689	Maybe you haven't.
0.0	0.158500081369	And -- and -- you know, it goes back to the whole concept of regulations, which are in everything.
0.0	0.0590812691811	It's not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.181801878541	And it's not the folks on Wall Street.
0.0	0.0445790501364	I want to take off from that point and argue the same thing.
0.0	0.71920792309	I do not want to walk my five grandkids through the charred remains of a once great country called America, and say, "Here you go, $20 trillion dollars of debt.
0.0	0.559990846665	And in fact, Kissinger's actions in Cambodia, when the United States bombed that country, overthrew Prince Sihanouk, created the instability for Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge to come in, who then butchered some 3 million innocent people, one of the worst genocides in the history of the world.
0.0	0.218209158091	But, by the way, when it comes to a woman having to make a very personal choice, ah, in that case, my Republican colleagues love the government and want the government to make that choice for every woman in America.
0.0	0.0365072919624	You get the Congress.
0.0	0.0584097903963	They will -- some will follow.
0.0	0.561438432953	And I'm the only one up on this stage who back in April put forward a detailed entitlement reform plan that will save over $1 trillion, save Social Security, save Medicare, and avoid this -- avoid what Hillary Rodham Clinton will do to you.
0.0	0.0481977620017	I would change them.
0.0	0.0265962909591	John.
0.0	0.168609034681	Let me start -- I want to get to the substance of the question on jobs, but I want to start with something.
0.0	0.51134534088	Absolutely, they should fight to fund -- defund Planned Parenthood, and I don't think the president should shut down the government simply to send our taxpayer dollars to this group.
0.0	0.529915716346	Well, first of all, this is an issue that's been debated now for 30 years.
0.0	0.0527699880615	I love Donald Trump.
0.0	0.0477752149744	And Mr. Trump is very focused...
0.0	0.175904610753	The first thing is we have to strengthen our alliances around the world.
0.0	0.430794442572	The student loan problem has been created by government.
0.0	0.343001818712	We have got to destroy their training camps and recruiting centers.
0.0	0.223353575623	-- the governor's absolutely right.
0.0	0.260768550567	But the Democrats are going to bring a lawsuit, and you have to have certainty.
0.0	0.221944945622	That is not what America is supposed to be about.
0.0	0.157367548052	See, in Ohio, we've had some controversial decisions.
0.0	0.185233642274	But getting back to Martha's question about how we end dependency, do we have to have a cultural change?
0.0	0.130605678849	I'm the only guy on this stage -- you know, everybody has an "only guy" -- "I'm the only guy this; I'm the only guy that."
0.0	0.291101276303	Secretary Clinton, I do have a disagreement here.
0.0	0.274844375314	So yes, you're going to hear a lot of talk about tax reform --
0.0	0.457531033098	You have to deal with entitlements, you have to be in a position to control discretionary spending.
0.0	0.174121074815	It can not be someone that agrees with his agenda.
0.0	0.0284629961248	I'm too trusting.
0.0	0.123002042906	I was ready to lead, but I wasn't ready to run.
0.0	0.146133006175	Just ditto to that.
0.0	0.161917488701	And I'll allow putting that tariff or whatever he's saying here...
0.0	0.0742772100204	But I think they will see a very good option here.
0.0	0.255373339837	And said, well, she said you were angry and I said to myself, huh, she's right.
0.0	0.39888428045	Two points.
0.0	0.432843233836	We're closing hospitals, we're closing wards, we're closing so many because the states want to save money.
0.0	0.256323897762	They want a political revolution in which millions of Americans stand up, come together, not let the Trumps of the world divide us, and say, you know what, in this great country, we need a government that represents all of us, not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.
0.0	0.0606343518233	You've got a bit of experience, I would imagine.
0.0	0.176814979174	Fiscal discipline, know what you're doing.
0.0	0.0126782284999	Okay.
0.0	0.160650047835	We have to get the remaining 10.
0.0	0.429842758457	So why are the pharmaceutical companies consolidating?
0.0	0.176238897072	There are loads of great ideas, great conservative ideas from wonderful think tanks about how to reform the tax code.
0.0	0.571903466835	Back in 2004, one of my predecessors to the Senate by the name of Bob Graham, a Democrat, ran for president missing over 30 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.606603888309	If you're a farmer, if you're a rancher, if you are small business owner, the death tax is gone.
0.0	0.153269345209	This is why, fundamentally, we have to take our government back.
0.0	0.399900746998	And not only did I fight them, but I beat them.
0.0	0.067321406192	You gotta be -- stick with it, and all that.
1.0	0.9999923871	If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world -- and we double tax, as you know.
0.0	0.381931177289	I was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came.
0.0	0.190101779475	So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.227789130963	I would just say that...
0.0	0.359258092892	When the Social Security program was started in the 1930s, not very many women worked.

0.0	0.0743725815726	I mean, Chris will know about that.
0.0	0.369977715376	And I will assure you, as the governor of the state of Texas, and as those last four years have shown me, the preparation to be ready to stand on this stage and talk about those monetary policies, those domestic policies, and those foreign policies, Americans are going to see that I am ready to be that individual.

0.0	0.0953991533465	Their family is waiting for them.
0.0	0.0223901772779	And how do I know it?
0.0	0.343710373906	I don't know if any of us could have done what they did, one after another, within 48 hours of that tragedy taking place.
0.0	0.110739161044	That's what I'm working towards.
0.0	0.0964039460878	It is an agenda, in my view, that would do great harm to our country.
0.0	0.0912614266313	What are the rules on who gets to follow up.
0.0	0.190405560553	I -- I've been for pausing on admitting the Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.668951404991	There is one major country -- the United States -- which ends up spending almost three times per capita what they do in the U.K. guaranteeing health care to all people, 50 percent more than they do in France guaranteeing health care to all people, far more than our Canadian neighbors, who guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.238124771719	And Carl -- Carl, I'm not finished yet.
0.0	0.270955286834	Well, first off, what we don't do is do what Hillary Clinton and John Kerry and Barack Obama want us to do, which is their solution for everything, put more taxes on it, give more money to Washington, D.C., and then they will fix it.
0.0	0.140022012203	Those are two leaders that I admire very much.
0.0	0.519356270551	And so he undermines the Constitution, and he undermines free enterprise by expanding government, and he betrays our allies and cuts deals with our enemies and guts our military.
0.0	0.136577747192	You've got to keep asking.
0.0	0.279265753704	That sounds like a long time ago.
0.0	0.510403840395	Two of them were among the most highly decorated -- they weren't allowed on a military base to have guns.
0.0	0.620392776994	So they soybean sales from Iowa, entire soybean production goes -- the equivalent of it goes to China.
0.0	0.263975214825	Everytime they got a paycheck, the government reached in and took something out of it before they ever saw it.
0.0	0.5	What you need to do is free up interest rates.
0.0	0.183783986194	I think what our campaign is indicating is that the American people are tired of establishment politics, tired of establishment economics.
0.0	0.367424668084	The reason all of us are here is we believe we should be fighting for the working men and women of this country, and not Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.120531573576	Socialist and government dependent.
0.0	0.193183958727	I mean, let me be honest with the people who are watching at home.
0.0	0.235531924911	If I'm president, there won't be stupid deals anymore.
0.0	0.0681997752605	And, you know, we have a whole variety of things that they can do and they can do these things simultaneously.
0.0	0.595724471005	It would bring the money back into the United States to help build jobs by American companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about.
0.0	0.520457896288	But view is those trade policies have enabled corporate America to shut down in this country, throw millions of people out on the street.
0.0	0.272511779225	We've worked hard our whole life to provide a better family -- a better life for our family.
0.0	0.204669490995	We will arm and train the Kurds.
0.0	0.254825242632	I'm very proud that NARAL endorsed me because when it comes to it we need a leader on women's issues.
0.0	0.44604074863	They come from another country and they're immediately sent out.
0.0	0.236549170529	We had Iran putting operatives in South America and Central America.
0.0	0.151357613567	It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are.
1.0	0.992409420902	I would note that Art Laffer, Ronald Reagan's chief economic adviser, has written publicly, that my simple flat tax is the best tax plan of any of the individuals on this stage cause it produces economic growth, it raises wages and it helps everyone from the very poorest to the very richest.
0.0	0.15004928233	We don't need to add new rules, we need to make sure the FBI does its job.
0.0	0.349434930201	I'm not running against Governor Bush, I'm not running against anyone on this stage.
0.0	0.216824947575	You're not going to even allow them to come to our country?
0.0	0.238999081271	The government has tried it their way.
0.0	0.183300153239	And as president of the United States, it's all about communication, folks.
0.0	0.0654890913562	They're not my ideas, and I don't necessarily agree with all of them.
0.0	0.629333636153	For example, all right, who in America denies that we have an infrastructure that is crumbling?
0.0	0.288248534164	And...
1.0	0.925701221968	Everybody voted for it wanting to see Libya move toward democracy, of course we all wanted to do that.
0.0	0.369175790235	He was overthrown by British and American interests because he threatened oil interests of the British.
0.0	0.0957388290066	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.351899613677	I was a person who has dealt extensively with these homeland security issues.
0.0	0.671985410138	Low income people who are not involved in the political process.
0.0	0.589234651335	In 2011, the sequester was passed as a reform to slow down the rate of government.
0.0	0.313275154001	We don't represent Wall Street, we don't represent the billionaire class, so it ends up I'm the only candidate up here of the many candidates who has no Super PAC.
0.0	0.20913178882	We can use it to break up the banks, if that's appropriate.
0.0	0.375773359099	And with respect to the 2007 bill, this was Ted Kennedy's bill.
0.0	0.0568815606624	I'll say this.
0.0	0.141881120209	...I'm going to go to Washington to stop it...
0.0	0.157476369606	That could be the great Trojan Horse.
0.0	0.133912719876	And the problem, Maria, is that the military is not ready, either.
1.0	0.406687803897	But I will -- but I will tell you this, the socialist says they're going to pay for everything and give you everything for free, except they don't say they're going to raise it through taxes to 90 percent to do it.
0.0	0.0217781797104	And that's what I intend to do.
0.0	0.274929496286	I strongly support the president's executive actions.
0.0	0.0905633082314	They need to learn English, adopt our values, roll up their sleeves and get to work.
0.0	0.308843461313	It's always a solution of the left to create more Government from the Federal Government.
0.0	0.208088433208	But here's the best way that we're going to make America much more exceptional: it is to make sure we put someone on that stage in September who will fight Hillary Clinton and make sure she never, ever gets in the White House again.
0.0	0.138349441863	Neil, Neil -- can I say one thing about this.
0.0	0.394486800519	Why don't we just give a chicken in every pot, while we're, you know, coming up -- coming up with these fantasy tax schemes.
0.0	0.321164708232	And as someone who's worn the uniform of the country, that's how we build our military back up.
0.0	0.171399365812	But also, I can't fake anger.
0.0	0.138465036682	You know, I listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas.
0.0	0.15872433347	We were wrong.
0.0	0.865326669141	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.33490167842	But in the interim, in the absence of that, what's happening is some of these tech companies are taking those -- those centers (ph) to Canada because they can get people to go over there instead of here.
0.0	0.140200649871	We lose on trade.
0.0	0.277193820083	They are refusing to...
0.0	0.219219684773	You know, back in September, my friend Donald said that he had had his lawyers look at this from every which way, and there was no issue there.
0.0	0.306527888305	You know, a lot of business activity in America is conducted like the guy that does my dry cleaning.
0.0	0.381923259415	So, let's not in anyway imply here that either President Obama or myself, would in anyway not take on any vested interested, whether it's Wall Street, or drug companies, or insurance companies, or frankly, the gun lobby to stand up to do what's best for the American people.
0.0	0.380986222245	The fact is, there's a number of things that the next president is going to have to do to clean up this mess.
0.0	0.695341966609	We will invest in education, and jobs for our kids, not incarceration and more jails.
0.0	0.0902113757289	I don't like that.
0.0	0.237095178848	What would motivate me and what would be the guiding light for me in terms of immigration reform, Judy, is to bring families together, not divide them up.
0.0	0.271519041028	You sit down and you work with people, you make demands of people, in this case demanding Iran stop the support of international terrorism.
0.0	0.13621999746	We will win on everything we do.
0.0	0.166776881528	Nobody can deny them.
0.0	0.20883782199	OK, just so you understand -- I know so much about trading about with China.
0.0	0.272974574237	Bernie Sanders has already said it.
0.0	0.130385984454	You ought to just be able to get over it, get used to it...
0.0	0.320605154833	They get them on the black market.
0.0	0.214157688148	This is incredibly complicated, because we've got Iran as a big player, in addition to Russia.
0.0	0.368144341688	When I'm president of the United States, we are going to win this war on ISIS.
0.0	0.826292983201	That's 13,000 miles.
0.0	0.521144594928	Not all of his top national security advisors agreed with that.
0.0	0.106748495362	Government is the enemy.
0.0	0.490554563854	And this deal is giving him a pathway to a bomb, a missile to deliver it, and money to pay for it all.
0.0	0.284590526297	They're looking -- they're recruiting people that enter this country as doctors and engineers and even fiances.
0.0	0.179406954379	And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word.
0.0	0.0970587068579	He needs to recognize that those kinds of things are in fact an existential threat to us.
0.0	0.303468558436	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.182770952588	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.90379001024	... the mandates and have a simple flat tax.
0.0	0.274053371285	It was a terrible sight.
0.0	0.0526644777456	Hey look, he never had a chance.
0.0	0.240205332948	... on the issue -- on the issue of citizenship, Donald...
0.0	0.443057332233	I deployed the National Guard after I stood on the ramp in Dallas, Texas and looked the president of the United States in the eye and said, "Mr. President, if you won't secure the border, Texas will," and that's exactly what we did.
0.0	0.231801183686	Well, I was pleased that NATO announced just this week that they're going to start doing patrols in the Mediterranean, in the Aegean, to try to interdict the smugglers, to try to prevent the kind of tragedies that we have seen all too often, also to try to prevent more refugees from coming to the European Union.
0.0	0.477847817059	We'd rebuild infrastructure that would also create jobs in this country, and we'd work with the states to do it the right way, to do it more efficiently and more effectively.
0.0	0.19143971372	And this big powerful, corrupt bureaucracy works now only for the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected.
1.0	0.793294322318	In Florida, we have the lowest in-state tuition of any state, because there's accountability, just as John said.
0.0	0.104392485044	They do celebrate more dependence on the government.
0.0	0.152499911872	This is the only time I've had a chance, let me finish.
0.0	0.101872366496	Let me say on that...
0.0	0.588365162975	And somebody walked in and shot them, killed them.
0.0	0.250240567317	Well, one of us ran against Barack Obama.
0.0	0.275746912959	Well, this is going to be a show me, don't tell me election.
0.0	0.288248534164	I have.
0.0	0.230504838535	And I have a road map and a plan right now to get us to balance.
0.0	0.175309455545	I looked at the intelligence.
0.0	0.493309235682	You know, 200 years ago, America was founded on this powerful principle that our rights don't come from government.
0.0	0.162294095291	Lawrence Tribe and (inaudible) from Harvard -- of Harvard, said that there is a serious question as to whether or not Ted can do this.
0.0	0.457447956867	Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well.
0.0	0.490229703109	The president of the United States admitting that he's weakening our government's position, our foreign policy standing, because he can't control spending in D.C..
0.0	0.138324658145	And that is that one of the things you're watching tonight are 11 quality candidates debating an important issue.
0.0	0.302091257744	It's you see the health insurance companies getting together.
0.0	0.126065696426	You know what he said to me?
0.0	0.0800001435388	(APPLAUSE) This is not a cage match.
0.0	0.926122619437	You know, the annual Medicare budget is over $600 billion.
0.0	0.752056253879	We're up 347,000 jobs.
0.0	0.0242368020195	I think you're --
0.0	0.523395906431	We went after companies that were doing things that were against the law.
0.0	0.0479303978793	And, you look at the questions -- "Donald Trump, are you a comic-book villain?"
0.0	0.0767585493811	But I was born here.
0.0	0.424509622591	And you put me on that stage against her next September, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.283711167151	And he allows states to go ahead and do whatever they want on a substance that's illegal.
0.0	0.536371914918	I've heard a lot of hot rhetoric here tonight, but I've got to tell you, as somebody that actually passed a budget; that paid down a half-a-trillion dollars of our national debt, you can't do it alone.
0.0	0.581079802001	So what we have tried to do and what President Obama succeeded in doing was to build on the health care system we have, get us to 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.361061481514	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.924156624715	We now have a 73,000-page tax code.
0.0	0.102521777367	We have to get back into looking at what's causing it.
0.0	0.0707797589138	Recognize that the caliphate is what gives them the legitimacy to go out on a jihadist mission, so we need to take that away from them.

0.0	0.292655107957	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you better get rid of the SuperPacs because they causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that have been made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.295937845523	But you know what, you can make a middle class wage, you have decent health care, decent benefits.
0.0	0.346450731171	Why didn't they call the police?
0.0	0.242852699154	Well, first of all, let's understand why we are even having this debate and why Donald tapped in to some of that anger that's out there about this whole issue.
0.0	0.0848311056001	Do people not care about all of our sacrifice?
0.0	0.128768150189	And I believe that the best way to do that is to be aggressive, to be principled, but to have the goal of trying to improve relations.
0.0	0.113426523701	If I have a weakness, it's that I try to live by the rules.
0.0	0.43440622568	I want to find out why those two young people -- those two horrible young people in California when they shot the 14 people, killed them -- people they knew, people that held the wedding reception for them.

0.0	0.227409990112	And we're letting them get away with it and we can't let them get away with it.
0.0	0.0867759563171	And let me be clear.
0.0	0.177219822273	And by the way, I hope we can end the trade embargo with Cuba as well.
0.0	0.296887422107	But we're not gambling.
0.0	0.436735311519	What we need to do is take the rest of the federal entitlements, not just welfare, but food stamps and Medicaid and housing programs and do the same thing we did with welfare.
0.0	0.200588663465	Imagine -- imagine -- if a politician were held to that standard of account.

0.0	0.124209315953	Let me tell you who Larry Tribe is.
0.0	0.0591538230124	We need to stop that.

0.0	0.606100222894	You think about the regulatory cost and the tax cost -- that's why small businesses are closing, rather than being formed in our country right now.
0.0	0.167294845172	It could be people that are going to do great, great destruction.
0.0	0.281499458865	It's actually evidence of the bias that exists in the American media today.
0.0	0.694752437263	Mine actually cuts the payroll tax, and I think it would spread the tax cut across all socioeconomic levels, and would allow then it to be something that would be broadly supported by the public in an election.
0.0	0.121904346838	I don't know where you...
0.0	0.397667343639	They know we will be committed to victory.
0.0	0.14748385619	They know that this country is not respected around the world anymore.
0.0	0.161925285902	For a start, the secretary and I disagree -- and I think the president does not agree with her -- in terms of the concept of a no-fly zone in Syria.
0.0	0.392431891876	You can -- if you -- you flew in with your 767, didn't you?
0.0	0.141931759123	Makes it a whole lot easier for them to want to go somewhere else.
0.0	0.288248534164	No.
0.0	0.187671974478	It's not only offensive; it's dangerous.
0.0	0.20999187765	That's all I'm saying.
0.0	0.670923763151	And that's an economy where ordinary Americans are working longer hours for low wagers.
0.0	0.207839773783	You know why three?
0.0	0.297534577772	If you listen to the State of the Union the other night, he described them as a bunch of guys with long beards on the back of a pickup truck.
0.0	0.0878698750935	Not my kind of guy.
0.0	0.309185864864	And by the way, as important as those two phone calls are, they are also very important because they say this.
0.0	0.102287527036	But the real -- but I think we have to get back to what this election has to be about.
0.0	0.0852026647621	They're never going to let it happen.
0.0	0.26597052976	Nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with.
0.0	0.202133842632	I'm going to prioritize those recipients who need the most help first.
1.0	0.485574907937	The Oregon study showed this.
0.0	0.253381074105	Now we're having smaller families.
0.0	0.241830629673	But what happened is a political vacuum developed.
0.0	0.369854895173	Their kids come out of college, they have high debt and they can't get a good job.
0.0	0.305584146231	They don't provide any abortions in Louisiana.
0.0	0.131319390897	Now, on to your substantive question.
0.0	0.188056613558	This is the fantasy that I talked about in the beginning.
0.0	0.318605068844	And it's available on paperback, if you're interested in buying my book.
1.0	0.570539923858	All that's in that trust fund is a pile of IOUs for money they spent on something else a long time ago.
0.0	0.269747049474	I have a slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially.
0.0	0.0377819505521	They can have it anyway you want.
0.0	0.100932129977	We have work to do, and we now know a lot more than we ever did before.
0.0	0.346742760933	So yeah, someone who makes more money...
0.0	0.19244968263	They are devaluing -- it's so impossible for -- you look at Caterpillar Tractor and what's happening with Caterpillar and Kamatsu (ph).
0.0	0.091049433718	Not a very pleasant place to be.
0.0	0.351683024034	Why are there five even bigger Wall Street banks now, instead of the ten we used to have on Wall Street?
0.0	0.084777540352	I'll suggest a part of that was his celebrity.
0.0	0.928745791341	And if you make $40,000 a year, a family of four, you don't pay any income tax at all.
0.0	0.462589569902	It needs to be repealed and replaced.
0.0	0.348551686836	He might not take my phone call, but he would get the message, and the message is this: Until you open every nuclear and every military facility to full, open, anytime/anywhere, for real, inspections, we are going to make it as difficult as possible for you to move money around the global financial system.
0.0	0.482176225045	This is a country that is of, for and by the people.
0.0	0.315662692963	Both Donald and Jeb have good points, and there is a middle ground.
0.0	0.150749510106	You see, you have one side, the Democrats, and with immigration, all they care about is votes.
0.0	0.40614878491	Well, I'll tell you something: you can take everything from the top 1 percent, and you apply it to our fiscal gap, and you won't even make a dent in it.
1.0	0.989397894145	As I understand it, the African-American community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse.
0.0	0.0658797986849	Big difference.
0.0	0.675296083745	She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video.
0.0	0.292029411564	And why I am a staunch supporter of President Obama's principal accomplishment -- namely the Affordable Care Act -- is because I know how hard it was to get that done.
0.0	0.0596993913443	Well, it ain't Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.978796455953	And there are 48 million people involved -- 40 million, 65 and over, and 8 million other.
0.0	0.515574936839	It is why we have to reduce the size and power of government.
0.0	0.649552563211	I tried (ph), early in my marriage, explaining to my wife why someone named Sallie Mae was taking $1,000 out of our bank account every month.
0.0	0.199102529236	And he said, oh, I'm never going to attack.
0.0	0.319982273735	We are borrowing money from China today.
0.0	0.90224287899	But the average person takes out about $350,000.
0.0	0.434255812785	And here's the last piece...
0.0	0.258102421474	This is a remarkable and horrifying fact.
1.0	0.944409460182	I'll tell you what else they're upset about: you're 50 or 51 years old, and some kid walks in and tells you you're out of work, and you don't know where to go and where to turn.
0.0	0.582634184317	Look, I am deeply concerned about what's happening in every community in America, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths.
0.0	0.243430754641	He wants to change America.
0.0	0.322136928345	And I have the feeling you're going to find a lot of cost overruns there and a lot of waste and duplicative activities.
0.0	0.755312592507	We've got 11 million undocumented people in this country.
0.0	0.517923917362	They are employing themselves, they are potentially employing others.
0.0	0.245852255524	We need someone with a steady hand being president of the United States.
0.0	0.00851543019341	Thank you.
0.0	0.425057679184	I just want to remind you, people paid their money.
0.0	0.124224867554	That's not the role of the government.
1.0	0.650730075052	The government stole it, and spent it a long time ago...
0.0	0.343588923502	I happen to believe that Putin is doing what he is doing because his economy is increasingly in shambles and he's trying to rally his people in support of him.
0.0	0.799849674351	President Obama's preparing to send $100 billion or more to the Ayatollah Khamenei.
0.0	0.541613585693	This isn't free money.
0.0	0.0673608478412	I used the tithing analogy.
0.0	0.0308910708669	There are politics in the boardroom as well.
0.0	0.296084478048	So, yes, I do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white Americans -- particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have -- you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is.
0.0	0.354982421406	The age will have to gradually rise, there is no question.
0.0	0.171537484465	And if I were the prosecutor, that is exactly where they would be.
0.0	0.362628049541	Now, since September, the Constitution hasn't changed.
0.0	0.29007905064	Look, in addition to what Donald was saying is we also need to talk about the legal immigration system for permanent residents.
0.0	0.184805633674	And if we want to try to rebuild the coalition, as Governor Kasich was saying before, then what we better do is to get to the Arab countries that believe that ISIS is a threat, not only to them, but to us and to world peace, and bring them together.
0.0	0.225610462981	Absolutely.
0.0	0.255139937682	And he stood before the American people and he said, "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself," a profound statement that gave the American people the courage to believe that, yes, we could get out of that terrible depression.
0.0	0.237225450308	The Emanuel AME church killings.
0.0	0.294723580399	... wants to face Donald Trump in the general election.
0.0	0.329192461637	But I agree with Jeb, you can't just do this by growing the economy.
0.0	0.00822443726193	Maria...
0.0	0.281459701943	If I could just respond.
0.0	0.514706561858	Why aren't we talking about -- instead of cutting benefits for old people, cutting benefits for sick people -- why don't we say, "let's cure the four big cost-driving diseases...
0.0	0.335675232903	-- work better to lift everyone up, men and women.
0.0	0.0466048131827	I did a couple of speeches for them, I do speeches for other people.
0.0	0.0395219523694	Right.
0.0	0.18595367957	That has to be enforced absolutely with consequences for Iran at the slightest deviation from their requirements under the agreement.
0.0	0.126868721483	And the politicians always say it is so complicated, nobody but a politician can figure it out.
0.0	0.5	And now after seven years of your policies, we have the biggest majority we've had since the 1920s in the House; a Republican majority in the Senate; and 31 out of 50 Republican governors.
0.0	0.330082268962	We cannot be the world's policeman.
0.0	0.259606520072	We need to have stronger families.
0.0	0.723122293054	I don't agree that we're going to occupy and spend another decade or a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.344304066954	We need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources, but from sources overseas, that can be a real-time fusion effort to get information where it's needed.
0.0	0.133372557889	Well, Neil, I'm glad we're focusing on the important topics of the evening.
1.0	0.920491790109	You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don't agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements.
0.0	0.0192762792777	She was a great CEO.
0.0	0.553152628758	And what distributes goods better?
0.0	0.173232162808	And I was proud to stand with him and support it.
0.0	0.02860406284	So we have a disagreement on this.
0.0	0.363207359022	But also the biggest people (ph) -- now I've used that to my advantage as a business man, for my family, for myself.
0.0	0.263218232056	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.452023307413	The first speech I gave in this campaign back in April was about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration.
0.0	0.0531485077195	You've got to have a clear vision of where you want to go.
0.0	0.374751180792	I think the last eight years in the private sector have allowed me to see government from the outside, and I think that is a positive thing.
0.0	0.119395154365	We feel like we're being left behind and left out.
0.0	0.487563076165	No Wall Street executive has been prosecuted.
0.0	0.166133194927	And when we -- and when we do that, we don't do what the Republicans want, which is to cut Social Security.
0.0	0.90068257447	We eliminate the payroll tax, we eliminate the Obamacare taxes.
0.0	0.100136247651	(LAUGHTER) And he got nasty.
0.0	0.251719795001	I don't recall them calling for his resignation --
0.0	0.0105558258175	Alright.
0.0	0.303599906112	But I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost.
0.0	0.0957388290066	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.429964415757	Last I heard, a United States senator had the right to disagree with the president, including a president who has done such an extraordinary job.
0.0	0.852611159942	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.213732590599	If this country that does not keep its promise to seniors then what promise can this country hope to be trusted to keep?
0.0	0.138382395727	Professional politician that can't be trusted.
0.0	0.406395670625	But if I become president, I couldn't care less about my company.
0.0	0.26333199068	It has to be based on what skills you have, what you can contribute economically, and most important of all, on whether or not you're coming here to become an American, not just live in America, but be an American.
0.0	0.288248534164	And here's why.
0.0	0.0786104611917	It's a hard problem.
0.0	0.963708984698	On top of that, there is a business flat tax of 16 percent.
0.0	0.0411786649385	Play by the rules.
0.0	0.255197830669	We have people out of work.
0.0	0.135256562632	What we need to do is destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.0276361617549	We have to stand with them.
0.0	0.148728338983	That's the end of the conversation.
0.0	0.2818714937	Neil, my name was mentioned as well.
0.0	0.229470322584	Those three things put together are going to give confidence to job creators and you will begin to see wages rise.
0.0	0.289125055834	So let's set the facts straight.
0.0	0.0959800612672	The problem is we never get it done.
0.0	0.0596970473443	I'm prepared.
0.0	0.21679887717	You know, you had Herbert Hoover before that saying, no, we got to only worry about the deficit.
0.0	0.0327348054146	I will do that.
0.0	0.421360507639	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.250512381244	... his answer -- you name it.
0.0	0.314732435342	But Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term, and you should be showing up to work.
0.0	0.85652386636	Our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.0779949233473	I get to respond, right?
0.0	0.369875813832	I'm also going to take a bottle of White-Out with me to get started on all those executive orders that Mr. Obama has put his name to.
0.0	0.364292569843	He is -- this president is undermining the constitutional basis of this government.
0.0	0.208838925862	You know, the Security Council finally got around to adopting a resolution.
0.0	0.178324527296	Bill, I want to say one more thing about...
0.0	0.219858493468	So listen, this is the difference between being a governor and a senator.
0.0	0.0361001885988	He's a gifted politician.
0.0	0.892410265465	And therefore, they don't get the income tax break, but their prices are going to be higher, because the vat tax is embedded in both the prices that business that are charging and in the wages they pay their employees.
0.0	0.438117158738	Now that he is, he's changed his tune.
0.0	0.16575700889	I mean, I ask that with all due respect.
0.0	0.220801657571	They're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.494463466731	Our legal immigration system from now on has to be merit-based.
0.0	0.169859601674	That's not even an issue.
0.0	0.41960954296	The fact that it's happened for so many people here throughout our history, that's what makes us special.
0.0	0.0670972779608	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.65722987053	For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses closing than starting.
0.0	0.224445351401	Our country doesn't win anymore.
0.0	0.133728357427	Let me, you know, again, respectfully disagree with Secretary Clinton here.
0.0	0.960221581199	We'll tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money.
0.0	0.140647910341	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.128296781382	So there are people watching tonight in business.
0.0	0.0186896773651	And we are not England.
0.0	0.162291219333	Let me translate that for you.
0.0	0.123223217493	I talked about Donald Trump from the standpoint of being an individual who was using his celebrity rather than his conservatism.
0.0	0.0784512674022	Here is the one thing I'm not going to do.
0.0	0.48744951844	So, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities.
0.0	0.474766436003	But I do hope that in years to come, just as occurred with Cuba, 10, 20 years ago, people would say, reach normalized relations with Cuba.
0.0	0.288248534164	...
0.0	0.354943781655	That is absolutely inaccurate.
0.0	0.131916842993	A brief response.
0.0	0.401125415255	Well, this goes to the question you were just asking.
0.0	0.0397690214487	We can do that in Washington.
0.0	0.479514407678	So we have no disagreement about the need to buttress Social Security, get more revenue into the program.
0.0	0.217911080409	So conservatives actually do come out of Manhattan, including William F. Buckley and others, just so you understand.
0.0	0.344682561917	You don't have seven children and bring them into this world if you're not optimistic about the future of this country.
0.0	0.391278635928	And to expand on Mr. Carson's -- or Dr. Carson's question, let's face it, we have laws already.
0.0	0.352658845022	Well, first of all, if a company gets caught doing that, they should never be able to use the program again.
0.0	0.579240929334	And I'll tell you why, last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee, she admitted she had sent emails to her family saying, hey, this attack in Benghazi was caused by al Qaeda-like elements.
0.0	0.530790123559	So it wasn't just me who opposed it.
0.0	0.51276252034	He pushed through, and he passed the Dodd-Frank regulation, the toughest regulations since the 1930's.
0.0	0.416614937193	This campaign is not just about electing a president.
0.0	0.343931360299	In other words, the very rich are getting richer, almost everybody is going -- getting poorer.
0.0	0.0438713255828	It has to be dealt with.
0.0	0.370524946987	And in fact, in Obama administration, we did not meet with anybody without conditions.
0.0	0.182686030113	That is the appropriate approach in order to get the results that you are seeking.
0.0	0.262664636245	We're going to be actually out there trying to create a better life for hard-working Americans.
0.0	0.770160481951	That cost gets passed on to the people.
0.0	0.11025275415	Well, that's a real question.
0.0	0.111443872958	And so that was his explanation.
0.0	0.314253089453	If i were the president of the United States, I would go and look at every executive order that exists right now and determine which ones want to be voided, because the president shouldn't be legislating: not through that vehicle or any other.
1.0	0.986188150022	And let us be clear that every proposal that I have introduced has been paid for.
0.0	0.698015894783	And the entire New York times attack -- is that I disclosed that loan on one filing with the United States Senate, that was a public filing.
0.0	0.360112789683	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.345336099267	So we have a good group of people.
0.0	0.15872433347	He's wrong.
0.0	0.927946411063	Our wages are growing faster than the national average, and I've cut taxes more than any sitting governor in this state -- $5 billion, including no taxes on small business and killing the death tax.
0.0	0.0175372721694	We had Boko Haram.
0.0	0.240670221495	Well, gee, after the last debate, I was told that I didn't smile enough.
0.0	0.399962208342	Have you ever disagreed with a president?
0.0	0.113129309776	And wherever you are sitting Nikki, I'm a friend.
0.0	0.541037177334	It was the first time we did it since man walked on the moon.
0.0	0.266478909245	Well, they're the ones not listening to the scientists today, because doctors say that at 20 weeks that is a viable life inside the womb.
0.0	0.396066218259	At the same time, law enforcement understands there are people in the community who not only think that the system doesn't work for them, but works against them.
0.0	0.158043718274	I never said that.
0.0	0.397271486044	With Saudi Arabia and oil production, first of all, it's so critical for us to be energy independent, and we're getting there because of fracking and we ought to explore because, see, energy independence gives us leverage and flexibility, and secondly, if you want to bring jobs back to the United States of America in industry, low prices make the difference.
0.0	0.243562261658	Now, the fact is, what this president has done is invited Russia to play an even bigger role, bring in Vladimir Putin to negotiate getting those chemical weapons back from Assad, yet what do we have today?
0.0	0.288248534164	Again...
0.0	0.143989579737	It goes in the right direction.
0.0	0.370486681361	Well, listen, I've spent my entire life defending the Constitution before the U.S. Supreme Court.
0.0	0.322404957481	Any connection to the fact that not one Republican candidate for president thinks and agrees with the scientific community that climate change is real and that we have got to transform our energy system?
0.0	0.392541155486	Whether it's welfare reform and getting something back for the hard-earned taxpayers; whether it's engaging in Pentagon reform and taking on the big contractors that were charging thousands of dollars for hammers and screw drivers and ripping us off; or whether it's taking on the special interests in the nursing home industry in Ohio, so that mom and dad can have the ability to stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.
0.0	0.286035866704	But we allowed people to keep health care.
0.0	0.255559078041	You can't grow your way out of demographics.
0.0	0.623094485506	If you send a tie or a shirt made in China into the United States and an American goes to buy it at the store and there's a tariff on it, it gets passed on in the price to price to the consumer.
0.0	0.179158976735	It's very important we focus on the threats we face today, and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in.
0.0	0.58832867454	What this campaign is not only about electing someone who has the most progressive agenda, it is about bringing tens of millions of people together to demand that we have a government that represents all of us and not just the 1 percent, who today have so much economic and political power.
0.0	0.262879353934	In my administration, we will help to make sure we bring people together in the Middle East, and we will fight ISIS and defeat them.
0.0	0.130755720316	All we need to do is protect them, they will be in their own country.
0.0	0.397443396244	Yes, does Wall Street and big financial interests, along with drug companies, insurance companies, big oil, all of it, have too much influence?
0.0	0.595092751869	And what a sad sight that was: Men, women, children forced out of their homes.
0.0	0.0795148059088	And he got nasty.
0.0	0.260580776922	The fact is, the reason why...
0.0	0.0388421073819	This is extraordinary.
0.0	0.590926424556	We're going to cut Medicare and Medicaid, federal aid to education to help you, because the government is so terrible.
0.0	0.158959843323	I think we're on the verge of the greatest time, and I want to fix the things to let people rise up.
0.0	0.412213122301	We should put the NSA in charge of the civilian side of this as well.
0.0	0.158295747786	If you make your president, I'm going to put the country ahead of the party.
0.0	0.345639424607	It was never intended that the government should be in every aspect of our lives.
0.0	0.167901480777	I want to speak to all of those maddened by political correctness, where Hillary Clinton apologizes for saying all lives matter.
0.0	0.193883286065	I know personally how extraordinary and unique this nation is.
0.0	0.279356780435	He consistently underestimates it but I do not.
0.0	0.0763737419981	But here's the real key.
0.0	0.139964051605	If there was a -- and you know I'm not bringing a suit.
0.0	0.396949261942	As we all remember, Senator Obama, when he ran against me, was against the war in Iraq.
0.0	0.660274214893	I believe that when real unemployment is close to 10%, and when our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, Flint, Michigan comes to mind.
0.0	0.190894767217	Wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.331136120143	If they had guns, he wouldn't be around very long.
0.0	0.0967969421392	Freedom is personal for me, and I will always keep my word and fight for freedom.
0.0	0.0385642826408	I can.
0.0	0.327848288441	And, that will get to the nub of opportunity for our children, and an ability to see wages rise.
0.0	0.642149740139	It's now half the size of what it was prior to Operation Desert Storm.
0.0	0.245962208381	And that's what this economy needs to -- that's what this debate needs to be about.
0.0	0.112096547511	I've been there 35 times.
0.0	0.227342230922	I think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether it's poison in the water of the children of Flint, or whether it's the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the LGBT community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, that's what I want to take on.
0.0	0.293490718348	And we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid.
0.0	0.374451603135	That's why John McCain, even though he was born in Panama, was eligible to run for president.
0.0	0.132447050077	You see, folks, this is how socialism starts.
0.0	0.24561703448	And, that's why tonight I'm asking you for your vote.
1.0	0.999999937654	And again, paid for.
0.0	0.214134178029	Well, you know, I think, from a historical point of view, somebody with my background, somebody with my views, somebody who has spent his entire life taking on the big money interests, I think a Sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment, as well.
0.0	0.15230014098	That's why I've entered this race, and I think I have the experience to do it.
0.0	0.546639907182	It was an investment bank, Lehman Brothers, that contributed to our collapse.
0.0	0.587603711288	We're going to cut costs.
0.0	0.341716101484	We're going to suspend -- I've -- I've said this for four years.
0.0	0.179910976232	I think I'm going to win fair and square (inaudible) to win this way.
0.0	0.41560718909	We have to provide financial support to them.
0.0	0.602294217527	I've said I'm looking at a couple of different ways, one which you mentioned, Senator, but also trying to expand the existing tax to passive income that wealthy people have so that we do get more revenue into the Social Security Trust Fund.
0.0	0.706296730694	And I used it to pay off my loans.
0.0	0.257131210249	And right now, I will be putting up a tremendous -- so far, I've put up less than anybody and I have the best results.
0.0	0.276714732201	If even in Paris, if they had guns on the other side, going in the opposite direction, you wouldn't have 130 people plus dead.
0.0	0.988319597955	We are at 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.0719505845767	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.264091953661	There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies.
0.0	0.39876333317	The president tried to paint a rosy picture of jobs.
0.0	0.454779523262	But a great nation like ours should not be in a position where elderly people are cutting their pills in half, where they don't have decent nutrition, where they can't heat their homes in the wintertime.
0.0	0.375405204107	Why didn't they turn those two people in so that you wouldn't have had all the death?
0.0	0.814905343205	I have a proven record of success, 32 years in business, and 8 years as Governor of the state of Florida.
0.0	0.636679121227	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.210821864753	They want those planes made in China.
0.0	0.813766143519	This is money that people have confiscated out of their paychecks.
0.0	0.114549346011	I think it's a good product.
0.0	0.431397128865	Well, I was a conservative governor of Virginia, I governed that way, and that's my track record.
0.0	0.243589221122	I was invoked in that question, so let me just say -- in that answer -- let me say, the real question here, I hate to interrupt this episode of Court TV.
0.0	0.182147561612	I lead the opposition against it.
0.0	0.478815220078	And it troubles me that people are rewarded for tearing down our country.
0.0	0.223304907973	And it is a -- the kind of criticism that we've heard from Senator Sanders about our president I expect from Republicans.
0.0	0.519427362874	Really systemic racism in this state, as in others, education, in employment, in the kinds of factors that too often lead from a position where young people, particularly young men, are pushed out of school early, are denied employment opportunities.
0.0	0.612833945501	And it's a tax you find in many companies in Europe.
0.0	0.874048839955	I'm putting up 100 percent of my own money.
0.0	0.171299289903	But I recall when Secretary Clinton ran against then-Senator Obama, she was critical of him for suggesting that maybe you want to talk to Iran, that you want to talk to our enemies.
0.0	0.320726139499	I'm asking people to support me because I think I'm the most qualified, experienced, and ready person to be the president and the commander- in-chief.
0.0	0.0936277813155	Take it to the bank.
0.0	0.483488412874	I have the opportunity not just to run, but to win in the deep blue state of New York three times.
0.0	0.0283958773608	I think we need to do a lot more than we're doing.
0.0	0.655343920844	You just see the recent deal announced today or yesterday, more spending, more tax increasing, more regulation.
0.0	0.232953088532	What a president of the United States has got to do -- and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility -- is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe, that we work with allies around the world to protect...
0.0	0.574691382274	And everything is costing more money, and we are killing our -- our -- our people like this.
0.0	0.0614936598164	Well, when you look at the celebrity of Donald Trump, then I think that says a lot about it.
0.0	0.136650032007	And -- and I just want to take this opportunity to say, you know, in the 2012 election, you know, we -- and when I say we, Republicans -- tore themselves apart.
0.0	0.446148038955	And we're going to just fix everything with waste, fraud, and abuse?
0.0	0.596510000169	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, the slower the economy becomes.
0.0	0.164004508408	There is a radical jihadist group that is manipulating our immigration system.
0.0	0.348039128454	We lose with one of the worst deals I've ever seen negotiated of any kind, that's our recent catastrophe with Iran.
0.0	0.248381297976	It's "give me options on how I can make it harder for law-abiding people to buy guns."
0.0	0.423551475951	And when it began, we had no political organization, no money, and not much name recognition outside of the state of Vermont.
0.0	0.0142694677715	That's who's in my mind
0.0	0.15152927385	So, yes, we can talk about it as a racial issue.
0.0	0.122368977172	The second will be to the supreme leader of Iran.
0.0	0.12602568112	If that's not hypocrisy, I don't know what hypocrisy is.
0.0	0.273411899975	So I'm going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of Americans fulfilling their potential, because I don't think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single American to live up to theirs.
0.0	0.662872398019	So let's start by knowing where your money is being spent by the federal government.
0.0	0.276040673569	I just don't believe that this country's days are going to be deeply -- you know, going down.
0.0	0.72126997653	Doesn't hurt rich people if their bar of soap goes up ten cents, but it hurts the poor and the middle class.
0.0	0.108267568383	Well, I've learned the rules on this.
0.0	0.1053201079	It's a problem all over the world.
0.0	0.931316668358	If you just cut their income tax, there isn't much income tax to cut.
0.0	0.688145554971	We called Ben, he was with me 100%.
0.0	0.0440095496506	... and I'll tell you why.
0.0	0.1304504915	They believe some are smarter than others, some are better than others, so some are going to need to take care of others.
0.0	0.424942999993	I ask for your support to build, together, a safer and stronger America.
0.0	0.222292988691	You are working at McDonald's?
0.0	0.138720426899	And, I'll do that with the country.
0.0	0.364405803979	It's a -- it's absolutely disgraceful that Secretary Kerry and others said in their response to what's going on in Iran that this was a good thing; it showed how the relationship was getting better.
0.0	0.177673201962	I think our country is tired of the politicians who simply read the polls and fail to lead.
0.0	0.254043126123	It's not that complicated actually.
0.0	0.101586249282	And I want to just suggest to you.
0.0	0.328173364901	The second thing I said is we need to add reforms, not just increase the numbers, but add reforms.
0.0	0.248514733236	... tariffs that come against us.
0.0	0.318585600711	And we need to bring our debt under control, make our economy stronger.
0.0	0.274351765632	Governor Huckabee's exactly right, we need to honor the promises made to our seniors, but for younger workers -- look.
0.0	0.458272579053	We're one of the fastest growing states in the country.
0.0	0.287047446356	The natural next question is who actually has done so.
0.0	0.443224232907	And the people who are getting hammered are small businesses, it's single moms, it's Hispanics.
0.0	0.296143770469	Hopefully after the 2016 election, some of the Republicans will come to their senses and realize we are not going to deport 11 or 12 million people in this country.
1.0	0.970071951758	That's wrong.
0.0	0.203521081519	I'm tested.
0.0	0.33938775547	When you look at raising the debt limit, it should be leverage to try to reform government.

0.0	0.180477890202	Well, look, I think that she's been saying that for as long as I've known her, which is about 25 years.
0.0	0.00851543019341	Thank you.
0.0	0.191462095784	That tells you right away where he was headed on all of this.

0.0	0.0489001898812	You have to ban radical Islamic jihadists.
0.0	0.5	In my family, my dad fled oppression in Cuba to come to America.
0.0	0.344058043117	And that problem is too big regulations like the EPA, too much new taxes on business that we have seen and "Obamacare."
0.0	0.0561761229238	Just know where you want to go, stick to your guts.
0.0	0.364110217371	Americans are tired of hearing this debate -- want to go to, what are you going to do about illegal immigration?
0.0	0.367217824805	We are looking at an economy in which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.
0.0	0.147597126909	Unless you are clinically insane...
0.0	0.322142609949	Let me concur with the secretary, no question women's rights are under fierce attack all over this country.
0.0	0.224818320711	Nobody -- I could stand up here all night.
0.0	0.150105389173	Sometimes it's a complicated situation, but some things are black and white.
0.0	0.203180287767	And Bernie Sanders will tell them that it's because of the rich.
0.0	0.0731260267077	No one is a socialist.
0.0	0.130996671304	I mean, so don't -- so you can't -- you can't...
0.0	0.383331684795	You know, Obama has presented the American people with a false choice every time.
0.0	0.256096612437	And, when I hear people talking about means testing, let's just remember what that means.
0.0	0.0197858742813	How great is that?
0.0	0.0877756557667	Well, I'm glad you asked that, Maria.
0.0	0.410854208481	You know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in America.
0.0	0.310690037148	I have proposed there be a Middle East NATO so that we can combine our allies there to stand up to Iranian expansion, and at the same time join together to begin to stop and this ISIL thing before it becomes an actual state.
0.0	0.761732770511	Why does the fossil fuel industry pay -- spend huge amounts of money on campaign contributions?
0.0	0.394294049338	And that's the reason that I've said under my presidency, we'll create jobs and make American the number one manufacturing country in the world.
0.0	0.150772291603	No, not a comic book, and it's not a very nicely asked question the way you say that.
0.0	0.373345681527	Look, it takes three things basically to grow jobs.
1.0	0.949868506797	They were watching the humiliation of our young ten sailors, sitting on the floor with their knees in a begging position, their hands up.
0.0	0.622367216345	We're talking about a state that moved graduation rates forward from 27th in the nation to second-highest.
0.0	0.155608704732	And I could say, oh, I'm not angry.
0.0	0.205855923247	We need a leader who will lead the resurgence of this great nation and unlock its potential once again.
0.0	0.167502480597	They hit us with a cyberattack simultaneously and dirty bombs.
0.0	0.719845805934	So what if mass unemployment exists?
0.0	0.688481041868	Any connection maybe to the fact that our people pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs?
0.0	0.48083443509	And if you go to my Web site, berniesanders.com, what you find is not only going to help lead the opposition to that war, but much of what I feared would happen when I spoke on the floor of the House, in fact, did happen in terms of the instability that occurred.
0.0	0.0419751988006	OK, good.
0.0	0.11855061228	If you want someone to grab a beer with, I may not be that guy.
0.0	0.125124629265	But, you know what we're not telling them?
0.0	0.165114128951	Mr. President, we're not against you.
0.0	0.463199593206	It's a simple formula: common sense regulations, which is why I think we should freeze all federal regulations for one year, except for health and safety.
0.0	0.280372310001	The better way of dealing with this -- the better way of dealing with this is recognizing that there are people in, you know, the -- Islamic terrorists inside, embedded in refugee populations.
0.0	0.274053371285	A terrible sight.
0.0	0.181360078651	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.0893999828734	I win.
0.0	0.111889899482	Alzheimers, diabetes, heart disease and cancer.
0.0	0.274358369629	But our goal is, in fact, to try over a period of time to, in fact, deal with our enemies, not just ignore that reality.
0.0	0.20894118216	And here in Wisconsin, I want to reiterate: We've got to stand up for unions and working people who have done it before...
0.0	0.140862815041	It turns out we knew something was wrong.
0.0	0.689962727336	Mine is unique in the sense that my tax plan actually gets rid of the payroll tax as well.
0.0	0.747666701644	We're going to do a tax cut for all Americans.
0.0	0.151780073114	And I think once I'm in the White House we will have enough political capital to be able to do that.
0.0	0.286363377053	And I went to one of these Turkish refugee camps right on the border of Syria.
0.0	0.195667500953	Their kids are having a hard time finding any work at all.
0.0	0.228264452891	I am not a single- issue candidate, and I do not believe we live in a single-issue country.
0.0	0.00851543019341	Thank you.
0.0	0.208328973961	First of all, John got lucky with a thing called fracking, OK?
0.0	0.310746603389	...you wrote a story on it, and you had to go back and correct it.
0.0	0.0242878002307	You know, I see a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist.
0.0	0.255284043955	What we ought to do is tighten up our efforts to deal with the entry visa program so that a citizen from Europe, it's harder if they've been traveling to Syria or traveling to these other places where there is Islamic terrorism, make it harder -- make the screening take place.
0.0	0.0499600727939	The Syrians should stay in Syria.
0.0	0.247384396861	At the end of the day, ladies and gentlemen, our best days are ahead of us only if we work together, and I intend to put this country on a path of success by working together and doing the hard things that should have been done a very long time ago.
0.0	0.431471205474	I had to borrow money to go to school.
0.0	0.0740670821476	You want to fix Medicare?
0.0	0.0898277979162	They go to Harvard.
0.0	0.0882496857051	It is undermining American democracy.
0.0	0.323448350218	Well, first of all, I'm 7 and 0 in my fantasy league.
0.0	0.160970647076	But we need to understand that American Muslims are on the front line of our defense.
0.0	0.377247445122	That's exactly what we saw.
0.0	0.367503715636	There's a reason the NRA gave me their Carter Knight Freedom Fund award...
0.0	0.392038498088	There is no president, in my view, not Hillary Clinton, not Bernie Sanders, who has the capability or the power to take on Wall Street, large campaign donors, the corporate media, the big money interests in this country alone.
0.0	0.0557298153124	...before I go.
0.0	0.35434110201	... that's what you say in a primary.
0.0	0.361495908509	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.124741280897	We both have a lot of small donors.
0.0	0.236667567131	Look, under President Obama and Secretary Clinton, they're working hard to change the American dream into the European nightmare.
0.0	0.191110890529	Well, let me just -- let me just say, once again...
0.0	0.256546812322	I know some people like to say, "well, this is free money."
0.0	0.290129936563	And it has been a remarkable situation in our state.
0.0	0.753502479552	Now, I for seven years was the U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.187509663887	And sending that signal makes it impossible for us to be serious about taking out ISIS and restoring democracy in Syria.
0.0	0.0317920580348	I agree with my colleagues.
0.0	0.215661282453	So I believe that working with Europe -- and, by the way, you know, we've got some very wealthy countries there in that part of the world.
0.0	0.514196853812	In fact, what that hurts is hurt hardworking taxpayers.
0.0	0.0223901772779	And you know what?
1.0	0.700371754994	Not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama and the big government economy, the median wage for women has dropped $733.
0.0	0.0904109372933	I've got one more question for you then.
0.0	0.206774066277	No Jeb, I don't remember -- well, let me tell you.
0.0	0.300335677549	I've had more calls on that statement that Ted made -- New York is a great place.
0.0	0.175532727228	Yes, in my view, the government of a democratic society has a moral responsibility to play a vital role in making sure all of our people have a decent standard of living.
0.0	0.13038706147	You want to see a war on women?
0.0	0.310354106736	We know (ph) to go ahead and shut off the supply routes, and send in our special ops at 2:00 a.m. and attack them everywhere they go.
0.0	0.850641365511	And it's the most regressive tax there is.
0.0	0.0494739352406	I mean, you know...
0.0	0.0624298113359	I want to be in -- I want America to be the best...
0.0	0.191625404769	We call that the American Dream, although, it's built on the universal dream of a better life.
0.0	0.316640171725	I don't think anybody should expand Medicaid.
0.0	0.101432379532	Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.39992073268	So I not only had the opportunity to go through the Cold War struggles in Central America, and even after 9/11 to be involved.
0.0	0.137901374993	But I think to suggest that I have voiced criticism, this blurb that you talk about, you know what the blurb said?
0.0	0.330590252696	And you combine that with a plan to make manufacturing -- this country number one in manufacturing, you've got someone who's going to help revitalize and give hope to America, the place -- the place is that is the most hopeless today.
0.0	0.441231780828	The fact is if we don't address what's costing so much, we can't throw enough money at this.
0.0	0.121313470994	And I'll tell you, I'm not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump.
0.0	0.402311321208	Here's my promise, at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country.
0.0	0.198398731792	In this particular moment of serious crises, saying to the American people don't give up on the political process.
0.0	0.295897289022	Donald Trump actually seized on it when he talked about immigration.
0.0	0.530760255777	And this is what we have to -- I -- I've got to tell you, when wages don't rise -- and they haven't for a lot of families for a number of years -- it's very, very difficult for them.
0.0	0.150783154131	John, I'd like to address this?
0.0	0.538455373489	But in terms of shutting down the government, I don't think President Obama should choose to shut down the government simply to send taxpayer dollars to this group that has been caught, I believe, breaking the law, but also offending our values and our ethics.
1.0	0.999999850338	I have vetoed a reduction this clip size.
0.0	0.517885108123	I have the largest bank in the world as a tenant of mine.
0.0	0.220583669036	I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators -- back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.
0.0	0.574809187067	It would not necessitate us raising any taxes.
0.0	0.664444929377	When he meets with the attorney general in the White House, it's not "how can we protect the Second Amendment rights of Americans."
0.0	0.136327205036	And we can no longer continue to sweep it under the rug.
0.0	0.356821826403	One of them being that if you don't have some agreement within the system from states and from families and from students, it's hard to get to where we need to go.
0.0	0.059123725657	... the fact is, Neil, let's think about -- let's think about -- and I want to maybe -- I hope the president is watching tonight, because here's what I'd like to tell him.
0.0	0.163061858487	So let's support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition.
1.0	0.805534531497	I am tired of sending $300 billion overseas to buy oil from people who hate our guts.
0.0	0.854495683875	Health savings accounts are something that we introduced.
0.0	0.528570959858	And, you know, there are a number of programs that I think are duplicative and redundant and not producing the results that people deserve.
0.0	0.721844474411	I voted for Dodd-Frank, got an important amendment in it.
0.0	0.21471537074	That is who I'm fighting for.
0.0	0.454923382127	It worked for Reagan and it works for our team in Ohio.
0.0	0.755266954687	Meantime, wages have stagnated for 40 years.
0.0	0.15962647477	Someone who's going to stand up, and be very clear with our enemies as to the lines their going to draw and stand with them.
0.0	0.480110856431	This is a group of people that burns people in cages, that is conducting genocide against Christians and Yazidis and others in the region.
0.0	0.1606949537	Folks, we have a problem here with the leadership in Washington, but I'll tell you another problem.
0.0	0.479353910689	The simple fact is that the plane that's being build here is being sold to China.
1.0	0.94126490816	We have the world's best military, even though he's done everything he can to diminish it.
0.0	0.472378683696	I don't think the founders put the Second Amendment as number two by accident.
0.0	0.104920828423	You don't have to.
0.0	0.164139038573	Do we still have values and principles?
0.0	0.629692155054	Because, first of all, you may rename the IRS but you are not going to abolishes the IRS, because there has to be some agency that's going to collect your vat tax.
0.0	0.0395219523694	Right.
0.0	0.518976020797	Well, let me tell you one thing that I am the only guy: The only guy that has consistently fought the Clinton machine every election I was ever in over the past 26 years.
0.0	0.116624910396	And in your heart of hearts, you cannot wait to see a debate between Hillary Clinton and Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.307134869014	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.440070384002	And nobody, nobody on either one of these stages has done more than I've done and the people of the State of Texas to deal with securing that border.
0.0	0.0509168098857	I'm very proud.
0.0	0.0648776441001	They're Muslim.
0.0	0.869562352833	Mine is the only plan that saves over $1 trillion and that's why I'm answering your question.
0.0	0.180972232727	They shouldn't be going to Europe.
0.0	0.158217501803	In the same light, as the foreign leader, Winston Churchill's politics were not my politics.
0.0	0.0297117243058	I think it's -- yeah, I think it's a one-two punch.
0.0	0.196687105078	That never works.
0.0	0.0682336455095	And I have many great Muslim friends.
0.0	0.842376939304	Or we're going to ship 10 million Americans -- or 10 million people out of this country, leaving their children here in this country and dividing families?
0.0	0.0202790967832	What's crony capitalism?
1.0	0.980648711886	It is also the case that that Rubio-Schumer amnesty bill, one of the things it did is it expanded Barack Obama's power to let in Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.174490920107	I think there's a sense in this country today that somehow our best days are behind us.
0.0	0.359736596661	There are other attorneys that feel, and very, very fine constitutional attorneys, that feel that because he was not born on the land, he cannot run for office.

0.0	0.187222506303	MACCALLUM: Thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.296276889549	So what we're going to have to start doing instead of, you know, picking on this group or this group, is we're going to have to have a major reduction in the regulatory influence that is going on.
0.0	0.586586150625	I am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of Vermont from very significant majorities of women.

0.0	0.581968678949	I was the chairman of the National Commission on Homeland Security and Terrorism for the United States for five years.
0.0	0.215709675356	But the issue for us is to have a Congress that stands up and says not only no, but "Hell no" to this money going to a regime that is going to use it for terror, Susan Rice has said that, and we need to stand up and strongly and clearly tell the ayatollah that -- whoever the next president of the United States is going to be, and I'll promise you, if it's me, the first thing that I will do is tear up that agreement with Iran.
0.0	0.168609790182	We must insist on assimilation -- immigration without assimilation is an invasion.
0.0	0.261318889938	They're looking -- they're looking to manipulate our -- the visa waiver countries to get people into the United States.
0.0	0.648650855973	In fact, I was all for you until you started doing that, because that's a misrepresentation, number one.
0.0	0.205915881578	Not bad.
0.0	0.144761443187	So we've got some real work to do, and let's try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the Russians.
0.0	0.276435705976	Community banks are going out of business.
0.0	0.0744444605926	You know, we've got a lot of great talkers running for president.
0.0	0.594807816903	Now that applies universally to giant corporations that with lobbyists right now are not paying taxes, and as small business.
0.0	0.367833607669	On day one in the Oval Office, I would make two phone calls.

0.0	0.113694116878	But, here is the truth.

0.0	0.286584440477	Bad by those in the Senate who voted for it and if I'm president, we'll make our intelligence community strong, and won't have to keep everybody out, we're just going to keep the bad folk out and make sure they don't harm us.
0.0	0.165832258357	I will change the culture in Washington, just as I changed the culture in Tallahassee.

0.0	0.491759788738	Our waste water plants, our rail, our airports, in many places are disintegrating.
0.0	0.384804186448	They didn't save enough money for us to go to school.
0.0	0.679262702191	They see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on Wall Street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all.
0.0	0.281088613907	I'd also go after these sanctuary cities, do everything we can to make sure that we are not -- that we are actually prosecuting and cutting off funding for cities that are harboring illegal aliens, and then finally making sure the IRS is not going after conservative or religious groups.
0.0	0.303181469092	Why, for the life of me, I do not understand why did we stop doing vocational education in America, people that can work with their hands; people you can train to do this work while they're still in high school so they can graduate ready to go work.
0.0	0.355598071742	Those are the hard numbers.
0.0	0.896468842028	Yeah, we can create 13 million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure at a cost of a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.0251933999015	I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.128928354146	This is the unholy alliance that people need to know about between right and left.

0.0	0.062146197596	(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
0.0	0.0678322864554	We need to reverse that.
0.0	0.11898781808	I do not think we should promise or even look toward normalizing relations because we have a lot of other business to get done with Iran.
0.0	0.193913243305	We need to control the border, we need to do all of this in a comprehensive way, not just going back and forth and talking about stuff --
0.0	0.033039884621	Yeah, they are unhinged.
0.0	0.282200240838	But let me also tell you, one of the issues has got to be the integration of both community and police.
0.0	0.234812274802	Well, Maria, I'm glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what's going on in the world.
0.0	0.375228576204	The agreement on a cease-fire, though, is something that has to be implemented more quickly than the schedule that the Russians agreed to.

0.0	0.169656012211	We don't need newer (ph) laws.
0.0	0.288248534164	You do.
0.0	0.260096982915	All over this country we have Republican candidates for president saying we hate the government.
0.0	0.520678160609	And I would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country.
0.0	0.154030379243	Such a nasty -- such a nasty question, but thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.334708054143	I've watched to see people say that we should dismantle Medicare and Medicaid and leave the senior citizens out -- out in the -- in the cold.
0.0	0.238476655033	My heart has not changed, because I've always been appalled by abortion.
0.0	0.0727054898975	At least he's honest enough to call himself a socialist.
0.0	0.173411367239	Well, that's easy to answer.
0.0	0.0223901772779	So you know what?
0.0	0.204693349786	That we work with allies around the world to protect democratic values.
0.0	0.310250870175	We need leadership, someone who has a backbone and sticks with things, rather than just talks about them as though anything matters when you're talking about amendments that don't even actually are part of a bill that ever passed.
0.0	0.682171702702	For 30 years this country has been baited with that.
0.0	0.193477504553	If that's a blind trust, I don't know.
0.0	0.226161808635	He undermines it.
0.0	0.123837332626	The question was, would you meet with an adversary without conditions?
0.0	0.0332390378343	It's not constitutional.
0.0	0.38132271075	We don't need Hillary Clinton's price controls for -- again, does anybody out there think that giving Washington, D.C., the opportunity to run the pharmaceutical industry is a good idea, given how well they have done running the government?
0.0	0.248671798851	The point I'm making is this, the Federal Government should not be in a lot of things.
0.0	0.413103845501	Jeb Bush says we've got to be willing to lose the primary in order to win the general.
0.0	0.278453358394	I would give up some Social Security to save a system that Americans are going to depend on now and in the future.
0.0	0.330048509282	To talk about we're just gonna have a 10 percent tithe and that's how we're gonna fund the government?
0.0	0.261857508938	He's penalized -- and doesn't understand.
0.0	0.314653339977	... that, having been in the trenches fighting for this, I believe strongly we have to guarantee health care.
0.0	0.762958317633	Senator Sanders voted against it at that time.
0.0	0.299768930279	Watching this broadcast tonight are millions of people that are living paycheck to paycheck.
0.0	0.413427234664	You have to ban the people who are trying to hurt us.
0.0	0.361819527553	And when you do that, when you're in a position of managing regulations; when you reduce taxes; and when you have fiscal discipline, you see the job creators begin to get very comfortable with the fact that they can invest.
0.0	0.050062990171	It's a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.469674709434	And for 30 years, the issue of immigration has been about someone who's in this country, maybe they're here illegally, but they're looking for a job.
0.0	0.185882517227	We have ISIS and al Qaeda attacking us.
0.0	0.302383867093	This is about people's lives, and we should level with the American people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare.
0.0	0.514515093451	He has never defended...
0.0	0.375918530833	I want to go back to what we were talking about earlier, this budget deal in Washington.
0.0	0.0594715528392	We'll go to the Congress.
0.0	0.0589022580108	A lot of interesting issues have come together.
0.0	0.195000972373	And our adversaries continue to grow stronger.
1.0	0.906437022532	But I want to -- I want to follow up on something having to do with leadership, because, you know, today Senator Sanders said that President Obama failed the presidential leadership test.
0.0	0.18056184124	He's a good guy, a smart guy, and he would be a heck of a lot better president than Hillary Rodham Clinton would ever be.
0.0	0.717466609843	Just for the record.
0.0	0.178466950987	Most importantly, I think I understand leadership, which sometimes requires a tough call in a tough time.
0.0	0.427831183348	We would still have sexism preventing women from getting equal pay.
1.0	0.551853834412	I don't recall the Sun -- in fact, the Sun-Sentinel endorsed him.
0.0	0.00851543019341	Thank you.
0.0	0.111638085661	So, it's going to be my responsibility to make sure we move forward to solve these problems that are now out in the open.
0.0	0.316008876535	I put together the coalition that imposed the sanctions on Iran that got us to the negotiating table to put a lid on their nuclear weapons program.
1.0	0.96529183235	I think under President Obama we have seen a lot of advances, the Affordable Care Act has helped more African Americans than any other group to get insurance, to be taken care of, but we also know a lot more than we did.
0.0	0.302192706452	And we would still have governors like Scott Walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions.
0.0	0.0825113361198	I hope the Supreme Court upholds them.
0.0	0.289421444209	We agree that Wall Street should never be allowed to wreck Main Street again.
0.0	0.307716102883	All I'm saying is our next president has to be someone that undoes the damage Barack Obama has done to this country.
0.0	0.170240478588	But I like to be unpredictable so that people don't know exactly... (LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.274374649372	It's the New York Times, they are always wrong.
0.0	0.296924453408	That is like shouting "fire" in a crowded theater, and that is illegal, and I would do everything in our power not just to go after those who are here who we know who are here, before they can radicalize other Americans to carry out attacks, and it's not just the ones they've arrested.
0.0	0.291465592758	-- fix America, this is the formula.
0.0	0.221258543347	There is a better way to provide health care.
0.0	0.523634846783	China doesn't pay the tariff, the buyer pays the tariff.
0.0	0.113796392501	That is beyond unspeakable.
0.0	0.248945854055	And our economy was growing like crazy.
0.0	0.00786209605103	Edward Snowden is a traitor.
0.0	0.0766372833688	If we do that again, we will lose again, we will deserve to lose again.
0.0	0.100941923674	You know, I want to go back for a moment to what we were just talking about.
0.0	0.0088003498254	Think about it.
0.0	0.349733312597	ISIS came in, and now occupies significant territory in Libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold.
0.0	0.167467793553	And they must be part of our coalition to destroy ISIS and I believe we can get that done.
0.0	0.255753048719	That's fine.
0.0	0.886371827527	92 percent -- 92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama's first term belonged to women.
0.0	0.230892136742	Today, I'm 60, I'm not married, I don't have any kids.
0.0	0.0216560727984	I think he is right.
0.0	0.445941850123	People are upset about it.
0.0	0.27408473054	You also have to some strategically cutting in several places.
0.0	0.0200447011701	I like that.
0.0	0.45115883874	If elected president, I will do everything I can to expand Social Security benefits, not just for seniors, but for disabled veterans, as well.
0.0	0.412653256832	You find me a Democrat -- you find me a Democrat that will cut spending ten dollars?
0.0	0.0405430142	It's harder to talk to your enemies.
0.0	0.304712115976	And I'll tell you what Hillary Clinton has said: Hillary Clinton says she agrees with the dissenters -- the Supreme Court dissenters in the Heller case.
0.0	0.265681589531	They're a scam.
0.0	0.585871764936	I was an Army intelligence agent and a veteran during the Cold War, assigned to West Germany.
0.0	0.441575805795	Drugs is one of the greatest scourge in this country, and I spent five years of my administration working with my team to do a whole sort of things to try to reign in the problem of overdoses, and it goes on and on.
1.0	0.99999895218	Twenty-nine million people have no health insurance today in America.
0.0	0.179226028593	We have a huge mental health problem in this country.
0.0	0.193333534889	Let me tell you, if we don't get this election right, there may be no turning back for America.
0.0	0.572630212156	The Kurds have been asking us to arm them for three years.
0.0	0.185917824659	And for the sake of me, I can't figure out which one is which.
0.0	0.100613064596	ON the other side, you have so many Republicans, and what do they care about?
0.0	0.459341731269	We're going to bring jobs and manufacturing back.
0.0	0.276119484629	I'm angry because our country is a mess.
0.0	0.754700811932	We raised the military spending, took from entitlements, and raised domestic spending and the deficit will explode under this.
0.0	0.143797722085	We also want to dominate this from a commercial side.
0.0	0.0063149105421	That's my view.
0.0	0.153489139286	But it doesn't change my view that we need to empower everyone, women and men, to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make.
0.0	0.142298625208	I suspect you may have.
0.0	0.433325353399	She wouldn't just be a disaster, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being commander in chief of the United States.
0.0	0.177177777662	Why didn't they call?
0.0	0.28421602482	It is a false choice.
0.0	0.222015048911	We have to offer a compelling alternative that is based on hope and optimism and grounded in serious policy, which I've laid out.
0.0	0.0223901772779	How do I know this?
0.0	0.0375218927167	My point is this.
0.0	0.146751057767	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.139380442862	What we need to do is destroy their ability to attack us here over there, and then get out.
0.0	0.802017502411	But if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things, including corporate taxes, and including the capital gains taxes, you make that amount up pretty quickly.
0.0	0.0212982558785	I have Ivanka, and Eric and Don sitting there.
0.0	0.174599448573	So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives.
0.0	0.180514954981	Thank you all very much.
0.0	0.102869260163	And kind of -- that's what I see our campaign is about right now.
0.0	0.14124842529	So I'm going to come up with the best way forward.
0.0	0.140743689752	And not just green cards.
0.0	0.289317113954	I'd say, "General, enforce the law against everyone justly, fairly, and aggressively.
0.0	0.449783105151	You don't know it, they tax us.
0.0	0.163991188237	That sounds like people are afraid the president's going to take their guns away.
0.0	0.411789280261	I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would.
0.0	0.330090875405	If you take donations from Wall Street, you can't be independent.
0.0	0.190749129715	We're going to have a big, fat beautiful door right in the middle of the wall.
0.0	0.245780362184	By the way, unlike our country where we're totally predictable and the enemy, whether it's ISIS or anybody else, they know exactly what we're doing because we have the wrong leadership.
0.0	0.0623389981352	Why weren't they vigilant?
0.0	0.244203062066	What kind of signal does that send to the rest of the world that the United States is a serious player in creating peace and security?
0.0	0.386509395907	The chances of any litigation proceeding and succeeding on this are zero.
0.0	0.0331214515721	So we need to get on a different mindset.
1.0	0.999996561601	They don't want to pay 35 percent tax on the way back.
0.0	0.788996311853	If you look at a single mom buying groceries, she sees hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent.
0.0	0.315546263658	I'm a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.288248534164	No, no.
0.0	0.100587929335	I believe in it but we have to be smart and we have to use smart people to negotiate.
1.0	0.772931994367	Becky, if you want a 10 percent flat tax where the numbers add up, I rolled out my tax plan today, you can find it on line at tedcruz.org.
1.0	0.996265952579	We do what the American people want, to expand Social Security by $1,300 a year for people under $16,000, and we extend the life of Social Security for 58 years.
0.0	0.153535624952	We're becoming Greece if we don't work together.
0.0	0.485216646829	I have a debt to America I'll never repay.
0.0	0.408970071574	This is a guy who just believes that law enforcement are the bad guys.
0.0	0.36095650919	I will run on my record all day long.
0.0	0.285046430038	Well first of all, the idea that somehow we're better off today than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated president of the United States is totally an alternative universe.
0.0	0.23917240684	Let me just -- let me respond.
0.0	0.137933062041	And, let me now on Social Security because we were getting into a good substantive exchange, and I want to say I think both Chris, and Mike are right.
0.0	0.181550985569	Well, Gwen and Judy, thank you very much for hosting this event.
0.0	0.165569425976	They're concerned that Washington is so dysfunctional it is holding them back.
0.0	0.0249224425783	... on Larry Tribe.
0.0	0.145404297208	We need to bring people together in Washington.
0.0	0.802514773651	Last time I was elected governor, won a record margin in my state.
0.0	0.370845210366	There are a lot of people living paycheck to paycheck in Florida as well, they're looking for a senator that will fight for them each and every day.
0.0	0.352736655085	Maria, I'd like to interrupt this debate on the floor of the Senate to actually answer the question you asked, which was on entitlements.
0.0	0.383677491799	The planes are older than the pilots.
0.0	0.00851543019341	Thank you.
0.0	0.132275939434	...This is a matter not of math, this is a matter of morality.
0.0	0.219720621508	Every election we talk about Medicare and Social Security reform.
0.0	0.0406342045907	I know the Democrats have the ultimate SuperPac.
0.0	0.5	What you need to do is free up interest rates.
0.0	0.238222645789	We can get back in the game to restore order and security for our own country.
0.0	0.192977478248	You see what the Saudi's -- deliver them a strong message but at the end of the day we have to keep our cool because most of the time they're going right with us.
0.0	0.442669132546	We both want to get more revenue in.
0.0	0.378517621221	But as Bill said earlier, Roe v. Wade, it's has been the law for 42 years, and I don't think we should continue to try to change it.
0.0	0.195140461804	Let me -- let me answer your question on the Sun-Sentinel editorial today.
0.0	0.252386388989	You have a big lawsuit over your head while you're running.
0.0	0.603653067128	And it's why I've continued to focus on the fact that we need to declare war on the four big cost drivers because 80 percent of all medical costs in this country are chronic disease.
0.0	0.365530916063	Well, the deal was done.
0.0	0.076262032499	You have to have certainty.
0.0	0.234932880659	But Iran is at the heart of most of the evil that is going on in the Middle East through their proxies.
0.0	0.168701536493	How about talking about the substantive issues the people care about?
0.0	0.810866707739	The main problem with Medicare right now is that the average person pays in taxes over their whole lifetime about $100,000.
0.0	0.016344593788	OK?
0.0	0.159331416967	We will renew America if we work together, and I am totally confident that we will.
0.0	0.0527639341976	It is a real horror.
0.0	0.123290438554	You've got to bring people together.
0.0	0.568604262761	Marco leaves the IRS code in with all of the complexity.
0.0	0.0192305673197	Divide that out.
0.0	0.232440582598	And I can do it regardless of what the makeup of Congress is because I did it in New York state.
0.0	0.249658803494	Because Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama.
0.0	0.202078827182	And, the fact is, none of them.
0.0	0.193861782181	Secondly, as it relates to Iran, we need to confront their ambitions across the board.
0.0	0.120809693752	But let me go back to something that's very important.
0.0	0.234325785409	I think we have achieved a great deal with the Iranian nuclear agreement to put a lid on the Iranian nuclear weapons program.
0.0	0.397929310436	But mostly, the highest calling of leadership is to challenge the status-quo and unlock the potential of others.
0.0	0.134413255733	Folks, we've got to wake up.
0.0	0.221760986153	If we do not know who you are, and we do not know why you are coming when I am president, you are not getting into the United States of America.
0.0	0.0177786021504	And I'm glad I did it.
0.0	0.178486733171	But the key thing that we're seeing now is serious challenges to this country that must change, the direction of this nation must change.
0.0	0.548445070785	I don't think you expand entitlements when so many people are dependent on government and when the money the federal government is offering is going to be taken away from you after just a couple of years.
0.0	0.283902235258	But the reason America is a great country, the reason is because our compassion is in our laws.
0.0	0.115324190208	But on this point, if I may add something on this point.
0.0	0.233681598716	It was LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations in this country.
0.0	0.229986085115	They understand that there's a national security risk.
0.0	0.399772559207	And I took on the drug companies and I took on the insurance companies to try to get us universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.157169366428	They're tough, they're strong, they're great people.
0.0	0.294424916532	But, here is a pledge I've made throughout this campaign, and it's really not a very radical pledge.
0.0	0.0730415909683	I totally get that.
0.0	0.0517945391593	And, we come out here, and we do our thing.
0.0	0.286372064021	Since he has changed his mind on amnesty, on health care and on abortion, I would just ask, what are the principles by which he will govern?
0.0	0.232953101583	And you look around, and you see what's happening, and this is not the case when he introduced the doctor -- very nice, everything perfect but that is not representative of what you have in that line of migration.
0.0	0.202771483368	The contrast with the Democratic debate, where every fawning question from the media was, "Which of you is more handsome and why?"
0.0	0.29364114354	don't listen to the Trumps of the world and allowing them to divide us.
0.0	0.432612035938	Whose fault is it that Medicare is broken, out of money, that Social Security is broken, out of money?
0.0	0.136127653737	In all due respect...
0.0	0.3167086234	But I think there has to be recognition that if we -- if we are too punitive, then you'll go to other -- other technology companies outside the United States.
0.0	0.299050826765	China, they don't like to tell us but they have total control -- just about, of North Korea.
0.0	0.156429833342	I can agree with you or not, but you can't have a question over your head.
0.0	0.0942620948999	OK. You know, the Democrats who have the ultimate super PAC, it's called the mainstream media.
0.0	0.152540831031	We ought to have politicians who not only have government experience but know how the CEOs and the job creators work.
0.0	0.287810301303	We have a country of borders.
0.0	0.907306001477	So the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced: a simple flat tax, 10 percent for individuals, and a 16 percent business flat tax, you abolish the IRS...
0.0	0.215738026928	These mythical Arab armies that my friends talk about that are going to protect us don't exist.
0.0	0.961228009552	No, it should be repealed.
0.0	0.199898180399	And, PBS, thank you.
0.0	0.313800095943	That is the way to deal with China at the end of the day.
0.0	0.352453244209	I would note, just for a historic aside, somebody told me earlier today we've had like 200 presidential primary debates, and this is the first time there have been a majority of women on the stage.
0.0	0.779246332265	And I ended a federal entitlement.
0.0	0.357210052363	Please do not tell me that in this country, if -- and here's the if -- we have the courage to take on the drug companies, and have the courage to take on the insurance companies, and the medical equipment suppliers, if we do that, yes, we can guarantee health care to all people in a much more cost effective way.
0.0	0.278994008749	We don't win.
0.0	0.274306552731	I would begin by saying that I'm not sure it's a weakness, but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for America's future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people.
0.0	0.0979912619795	And for good cause.
0.0	0.100862049133	You know the nice thing about the mainstream media, they don't hide their views.
0.0	0.183271427537	Credibility counts.
0.0	0.309299314195	Iran is sponsoring terrorism in many parts of the world, destabilizing areas.
0.0	0.0814536714837	And let's not let the secular progressives drive that out of us.
0.0	0.204893298938	Let me just -- just say this.
0.0	0.282204803418	He's a major Hillary Clinton supporter.
0.0	0.40145092825	I am the only person in either campaign that's self-funding.
0.0	0.130394103651	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.183132312279	We would still have racism holding people back.
0.0	0.454517654711	Well Maria, thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the New York Times.
0.0	0.425782836775	And she is just one or two more poll drops down from even moving further left than she's moved already to get to the left of Bernie on this.
0.0	0.938352046691	She voted for it.
0.0	0.0557036745756	Bipartisan issue.
0.0	0.0223901772779	They know.
0.0	0.345794072176	Bill, here's the interesting position on this.
0.0	0.754617721755	A flat tax for everybody -- no exemptions, no deductions, no shelters, because some people have a better capability of taking advantage of those than others.
0.0	0.021629591912	You find me...
0.0	0.444223812125	Illegal.
0.0	0.332471522189	And I would note the other individuals on this stage were nowhere to be found in that fight.
0.0	0.42193180566	People with a high school education or less are not even living as long as their parents lived.
0.0	0.238175528167	But if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in Flint.
0.0	0.248835948625	If you're not willing to do that, nobody wants to do it, but if you're not willing to gradually raise the age, you're not serious about fixing either one of them.
0.0	0.223158966827	We have to provide the NATO support to back up the mission that is going on.
0.0	0.0632004030051	That was not, as I understand it, the secretary's position.
0.0	0.255753048719	That's fine.
0.0	0.47760297824	And she and I looked at the same evidence coming from the Bush administration regarding Iraq.
0.0	0.210289072825	That the Ayatollah is a radical jihadist who really means it when he chants, "Death to America, death to Israel."
0.0	0.290224442788	It's why you see Walgreens buying Rite Aid.
0.0	0.116108821744	The fact is that this Justice Department under this president has been a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.170254183091	It's kind of basic.
0.0	0.274446698909	And if we capture any of them alive, they are getting a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know.
1.0	0.00736868063241	It's not theirs anymore.
0.0	0.298830734902	What I did in New York was bring people together, an overwhelmingly Democratic state.
1.0	0.986332134485	And on Common Core, Common Core has been eliminated in New Jersey.
0.0	0.777274136395	Barack Obama got his massive tax increase, and there was no spending cuts.
0.0	0.15375531451	That's not true.
0.0	0.191651279793	And Mexico's going to pay for the wall because Mexico -- I love the Mexican people; I respect the Mexican leaders -- but the leaders are much sharper, smarter and more cunning than our leaders.
0.0	0.399921423735	It is disgraceful, and in a Christie administration, they would know much, much better than to do that.
0.0	0.168345328426	And yes, I was fired over a disagreement in the boardroom.
0.0	0.160500398416	We're going to lose Social Security and Medicare if Republicans and Democrats do not come together and find a solution like Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill.
1.0	0.110712202878	It isn't there anymore, Mike.

0.0	0.171680698169	But, what we did is we said to the working families of this country, look, we know things are tough, but if you want to help us go beyond establishment politics, and establishment economics, send us something.
0.0	0.517920892117	I mean, what we had was something the government made -- basically a bag of gas -- that cut loose, destroyed everything in its path, left thousands of people powerless, but they couldn't get rid of it because we had too much money invested in it, so we had to keep it.
0.0	0.10114268109	You gotta be patient.
0.0	0.0433603840314	I am passionate about what I believe.
0.0	0.269543138005	We differ, however, on a couple of key points.
0.0	0.200306559972	And where we are right now is we have got to stand up to the Trumps of the world who are trying to divide us up.
0.0	0.291034370607	I will, with your help and support, lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.268103965728	So whether it's green cards or any other form of entry into America, when I'm president if we do not know who you are or why you are coming, you are not going to get into the United States of America.
0.0	0.331073322172	-- at least half of the things Marco said are flat-out false.
0.0	0.658374900255	You're going to get it by paying your employees less and charging your customers more, that is a tax, the difference is, you don't see it on the bill.
0.0	0.464590969901	I've also called for the end of family detention, for the end of privately-run detention centers, along with private prisons, which I think are really against the common good and the rule of law.
0.0	0.200596481457	Now, I can tell you there are a lot of private-sector things that you could do with $12,500, which will get you a lot more than you get from this government program.
0.0	0.0127985376573	That's a blessing.
0.0	0.227511103287	We're not going to be able to rebuild it unless we put a no-fly zone there, make it safe for those folks so we don't have to be talking about Syrian refugees anymore.
0.0	0.229421349238	They can't even make a deal.
0.0	0.511373602958	I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years, and by the way, one of the members of that committee was Senator Strom Thurmond from South Carolina.
0.0	0.151941793825	And that is what they told me when I was in Jordan in November.
0.0	0.73124653723	But what is to prevent a future liberal president or a liberal Congress from coming back and not just raising the income tax, but also raising that VAT tax, and that vat tax is really bad for seniors.
0.0	0.0088003498254	Think about that.
0.0	0.0540271958569	Do you remember that, everybody?
0.0	0.490370332078	Well, first off, let's face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.383183856325	And I went there, and for 16 years, I fought the insiders and was able to get things done.
0.0	0.137889030766	And if you really want to believe that you can get your voice back, I will tell you, as I have all my career, I will continue to fight for you, because you're the ones that built this country, and will carry it into the future.
0.0	0.15872433347	They were wrong.
0.0	0.398752840453	We didn't spend any.
0.0	0.437448801161	So many companies are going to leave our country.
0.0	0.233612004824	I would put it in a blind trust.
0.0	0.734149888242	A lot has happened in nine months.
0.0	0.264257121851	And there's a reason why Hillary's supporters are echoing Donald's attacks on me, because Hillary...
0.0	0.192146203693	You did support a U.N. Security Council approach, which we did follow up on.
0.0	0.239677852632	Well, I am going to answer your question, Neil.
0.0	0.243462029441	In my view healthcare is a right of all people, not a privilege, and I will fight for that.
0.0	0.0197858742813	He does great.
0.0	0.23649252793	I mean, that's just the bottom line.
0.0	0.20909773545	And I believe people need a leader who is prepared to make tough calls in tough times and stand up...
0.0	0.295164784714	Where I see the weakness is in those three people that are left on the Democratic stage.
0.0	0.320452327066	Because we can't just save the American Dream, we can expand it to reach more people, and change more lives than ever before.
0.0	0.360833733327	Obama broke every rule of negotiation.
0.0	0.509633943703	It had missed, before I had arrived, expectations for nine quarters in a row.
0.0	0.0801160305777	But my wife is down here in the front, and I'm sure, if you'd like to talk to her later, she can give you more than you'll ever be able to take care of.
0.0	0.158773701516	... and I know Bernie, and I can promise you he's not going to be president of the United States.
0.0	0.0395219523694	That's right.
0.0	0.0600354193008	We need a unifier, not a cynical divider in chief, and that's exactly what I will do.
0.0	0.175647125952	With a couple of additional tweaks, we know what this will do.
0.0	0.0872223649416	I believe we are on the path to doing that.
0.0	0.455735535223	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.513318271461	So what I will tell you about our incentives -- our incentives are tight, and at the end of the day we make sure that we gain more from the creation of jobs than what we lose.
0.0	0.414147101066	Americans are looking for somebody that's going to give them, and there is a place in this country over the last eight years in particular that talked about hope every day, and they didn't just talk about it, they delivered it.
0.0	0.355160342082	Target the efforts for people that are committing crimes with guns, and if you do that, and get it right, you're going to be much better off than creating a political argument where there's a big divide.
0.0	0.279599377075	If somebody put me on their homepage, they did it without my permission.
0.0	0.992614474661	...income tax...
0.0	0.0131839053468	So we need 1,000.
0.0	0.0489115951433	Well, I respectfully disagree.
0.0	0.261931010906	Of course not.
0.0	0.272139199809	You blindfold the American people so that they cannot see the true cost of government.
0.0	0.0342325661731	SuperPacs are a disaster.
0.0	0.0917553735817	I frankly don't think there will be much change because I think what's going to happen is you're going to get more of the same.
0.0	0.0790588885562	And who can blame them?
0.0	0.333207046125	Come on, that's just not -- you scare senior citizens with that.
0.0	0.308733429568	Judy, one area very briefly...
0.0	0.738197235626	It's their money.
0.0	0.404244519906	The world has changed.
0.0	0.15872433347	He's wrong.
0.0	0.266865712334	Do we still have standards?
0.0	0.297053530921	Middle class may notice it when they get to the cash register.
0.0	0.302354094872	No, it speaks to the fact that I don't know those --
0.0	0.161047589585	As far as the wall is concerned, we're going to build a wall.
0.0	0.278662312532	We need to begin by undoing -- I would begin by undoing a whole set of things that President Obama has done, whether it's illegal amnesty or this latest round of EPA regulations.
0.0	0.706581580109	I just read today in the New York Times, $250,000 for a 30 second ad.
0.0	0.392243318636	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.346325728427	Let's talk about something that happened this week in the news.
0.0	0.260821310339	I laid out a plan at the Citadel to do just that and it starts with creating a "No Fly Zone" and "Safe Zones" to make sure refugees are there.
0.0	0.23177512601	Are you serious about this election?
0.0	0.378494546109	Yesterday, the president stunningly admitted this.
0.0	0.125932739642	It's why you see the pharmaceuticals getting together.
0.0	0.494938768367	But Jeb is also right that, if we just impose a tariff, they'll put reciprocal tariffs, which will hurt Iowa farmers and South Carolina producers and 20 percent of the American jobs that depend on exports.
0.0	0.773199621917	All the way back to when Ronald Reagan signed a piece of legislation that basically allowed for amnesty for over 4 million people, and the border is still not secure.
0.0	0.428107946158	She admitted she had sent e-mails to her family saying, "Hey, this attack at Benghazi was caused by Al Qaida-like elements."
0.0	0.161118216038	You just don't make promises like this.
0.0	0.391146652906	The FCC jumping in now and saying, "we're going to put 400 pages of regulation over the Internet," is going to create massive problems.
0.0	0.357685818547	And I'll go back to something that had been mentioned just a few minutes ago.
0.0	0.158043718274	I never said that.
0.0	0.273616713232	It is time for Republicans in D.C. to fight.
0.0	0.290940934448	But I want to start by helping those people who are most at risk, the ones who, yes, are cutting their pills in half, who don't believe they can make the rent, who are worried about what comes next for them.
0.0	0.270334700742	And I'm going to do everything I can to address distressed communities, whether they are communities of color, whether they are white communities, whether they are in any part of our country.
0.0	0.121476344682	We lose with ISIS.
0.0	0.112519232647	But I look at this country today, and I look at how divided we are, I look at how politicians are always posturing and issuing sound bites but never solving problems.
0.0	0.361513013472	So I'm asking women, I'm asking men, to support me because I'm ready to go into the White House on January 20th, 2017 and get to work on both domestic and foreign policy challenges.
0.0	0.330096628442	Because of a series of disastrous trade policies which have allowed corporate America through NAFTA and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, Secretary Clinton and I disagree on those issues.
0.0	0.0564115591293	We need to re-establish the relationships with the Sunnis.
0.0	0.284967457647	Just like getting rid of Medicare and Medicaid.
0.0	0.0693032747273	Super PACs are a disaster.
0.0	0.228833576184	I think it's a wonderful that that businesses start a 401(k).
0.0	0.121300522693	We need to rebuild our military, and this president has let it diminish to a point where tinpot dictators like the mullahs in Iran are taking our Navy ships.
0.0	0.426407746881	I'm not going to have something that Ted described in his tax plan.
0.0	0.0045253615256	Appreciate it.
0.0	0.23649740617	I'd sign that executive order.
0.0	0.224355567078	He just writes out an executive order.
0.0	0.204350895304	I know we can do this because we're still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.0223901772779	And you know what?
0.0	0.906185856647	Those of you health savings accounts.
0.0	0.708098613398	Today congress decided to take another $150 billion dollars away from Social Security so they can borrow more money.
0.0	0.16704909297	We need to be on the side that keeps Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.348640814109	That's why we embraced individual liberty, and we became the freest people ever, and the result was the American miracle.
0.0	0.114001931638	You can't have a question.
0.0	0.475722899128	I'm the only person on this stage that actually was involved in the chief architect of balancing the Federal Budget.
0.0	0.256324415257	But this is nothing new.
0.0	0.100085709412	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.036799592472	It feels different.
0.0	0.331765802522	It was a big insurance company, AIG.
0.0	0.320194099733	And we should back up the recent donors conference to make sure we have made our contribution to try to deal with the enormous cost that these refugees are posing to Turkey and to members of the E.U.
0.0	0.155590827481	Our friends no longer think we have their back and our enemies no longer fear us, and we're in a much difficult -- we're in a much different position than we should be.
0.0	0.379768489166	So, also, we can stimulate the economy.
0.0	0.429715927983	Let us actually go to zero- based budgeting so we know where the money is being spent.
0.0	0.535728361624	There is no money in the Social Security account.
0.0	0.16522983469	If people are promising they're going to take on Washington and cronyism, you need to look to who has been doing it.
0.0	0.0395219523694	That is not right.
0.0	0.145883351086	I've been passionate my whole life about the Constitution.
0.0	0.159033704053	Senator Cruz is precisely right.
0.0	0.386756641238	Hey, I'm in the United States Senate, and anyone who doesn't think that there is an enormous amount of waste and inefficiency and bureaucracy throughout government would be very, very mistaken.
0.0	0.208264871594	Look, here's the deal, in this particular case, the FBI made a mistake.
0.0	0.166619273882	Young people for whom getting involved in politics is as, you know, it's like going to the moon.
0.0	0.361948389514	So I don't know if you would call that a weakness, but my wife said "let up."
0.0	0.142390425066	But what he's touching -- talking about, I think has got merit.
0.0	0.35118545847	Well, there is no question that some people go overboard when it comes to trying to make profits, and they don't take into consideration the American people.
0.0	0.719485431129	We have a $19 trillion bipartisan debt and it continues to grow as we borrow money from countries that do not like us to pay for government we cannot afford.
0.0	0.0843871704795	But furthermore, what we have got to do, I'm sorry, yes, I do believe that we have got to do everything that we can, and it will not happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.537168580701	The the truth of the matter is, big government benefits the wealthy, it benefits the lobbyists, it benefits the giant corporations.
0.0	0.484788401706	The Democrats' answer to everything is more government control over wages, and more empowering trial lawyers to file lawsuits.
0.0	0.115004753713	It will never happen because they'll let their currency go up.
0.0	0.156033759754	I do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination to succeed President Obama.
0.0	0.0088003498254	Think about it.
0.0	0.297386682644	It's going to happen in this country, there are going to be further attacks.
0.0	0.272289660739	And I feel very strongly that I have an agenda, I have a record that really does respond to a lot of the specific needs that the women in our country face.
0.0	0.153917274719	And I say, look, it's not Republicans' fault, it's not Democrats' fault, it's your grandparents' fault for having too many damn kids.
0.0	0.113376801465	They explode the bomb, we have an electromagnetic pulse.
0.0	0.461773196931	You know, coal miners and their families who helped turn on the lights and power our factories for generations are now wondering, has our country forgotten us?
0.0	0.451006856422	Not just the hacking of OPM, but that is -- that is just shameful.
1.0	0.767464007248	We're sitting up here talking about all these other things; 71 percent of federal spending today is on entitlements, and debt service.
0.0	0.0032512577452	There's -- look, there's --
0.0	0.11766750025	Let's talk about our campaigns.
0.0	0.114815968384	Well, you're talking about -- yeah.
0.0	0.152494692793	Do senators have the right to disagree with the president?
0.0	0.774908001137	John, listen, let's keep in mind that for one-third of the 60 million Americans on Social Security it represents 90 percent of their income.
0.0	0.199343133304	I know what it's like to owe that money, and we've worked hard.
0.0	0.361464988043	Last I heard we lived in a democratic society.
0.0	0.175381082449	The only way we're going to defund Planned Parenthood is have a pro-life president.
0.0	0.452293976905	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.626628130611	And not only did I win, but I then worked with a Democratic legislature to put in place the most sweeping conservative reforms of any state in America, taking us from the most dangerous state in America to the fourth safest; reducing our welfare rolls by over 1 million, and replacing over 700,000 private sector jobs.
1.0	0.997156720535	I have long supported the proposition that we should lift the cap on taxable income coming into the Social Security Trust Fund, starting at $250,000.
0.0	0.47700893736	...The other thing I'd like to make about our plan, one more point, it is the most pro growth tax plan that I can imagine because it doesn't tax investments at all.
0.0	0.143390962205	I've got five grandkids.
0.0	0.29656031755	I saw them come down.
0.0	0.568041690766	Did any of you get a phone call from Bill Clinton?
0.0	0.243368890112	I want to get ahead of those, and that's why I've proposed a much more comprehensive approach to deal with all of these...
0.0	0.269094065594	I have fought my entire life to make sure that healthcare is a right for all people.
0.0	0.899392020678	And my record was one of cutting taxes each and every year.
0.0	0.574752746901	And when the president of the United States gets out to speak about it, does he support police officers?
0.0	0.143788804951	We need a nominee who is going to throw every punch, not pull punches, and someone who cannot stumble before he even gets into the ring.
0.0	0.171140762573	We have not provided them.
0.0	0.433554580104	For too long -- no, for too long, what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our people's jobs, and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us.
0.0	0.389565779601	What we are talking about in reality is a corrupt campaign finance system, that's what we're talking about.
0.0	0.160201399266	I know every one.
0.0	0.241822523384	But the leaders have come forward to realize that protest is fine, but violence is wrong.
0.0	0.199834760428	You want to talk about what we're going to be up against next year?
0.0	0.289874400106	I have talked to some of the young kids with tears rolling down their cheeks, are scared to death that today they may or their parents may be deported.
0.0	0.15779247453	And in that interview, he explained his views on a whole host of issues that were very, very different from the views he's describing now.
0.0	0.186593556366	So -- you know, you shouldn't misrepresent how well you're doing with the polls.
0.0	0.288248534164	You did.
0.0	0.104920828423	They didn't do that.
0.0	0.15375531451	It's true.
0.0	0.864804352296	It's called the value added tax.
0.0	0.125182407411	That debate reflected a debate between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks.
0.0	0.232889439668	And I'm very grateful to the brave Navy SEALs who carried out that mission.
0.0	0.427093810063	You also have to prove that you're going to pay these people more than you would pay someone else, so that you're not undercutting it by bringing in cheap labor.
0.0	0.493991422954	We got to do a lot about the high cost of high -- higher education, but we've got to make sure we're training people for jobs that exist, that are good jobs that can pay.
0.0	0.077802826911	Can we stop?
0.0	0.0147095683299	That's what I think we need to do.
0.0	0.224177676544	I'm looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.219548977537	So if you happen to be right, you could get the top job at the end of the day.
0.0	0.013987074194	Divisive and with no vision.
0.0	0.446729646439	How about we get the government to do what they're supposed to be doing, secure our borders, protect our people, and support American values and American families.
0.0	0.456112798192	And the way we've done it properly through regulatory action, not buy signing unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.218403508833	We're going to cut Social Security to help you.
0.0	0.0105165732181	I was the architect.
0.0	0.305230313837	No, the Federal Government should not play a larger role.
0.0	0.226520656042	I find it very, very hard to forgive people that deceived me.
0.0	0.0964544317911	We hear actually a lot of good intentions.
0.0	0.192169872144	Of course you are right.
0.0	0.0524340138333	Our decision is, then, do we give them what we need.
0.0	0.225610462981	No, absolutely not.
0.0	0.340013675191	And I have set forth a compact that would do just that for debt-free tuition.
0.0	0.478992086405	It puts us on a level, even playing field, which brings jobs here at home...
0.0	0.543984621937	They're devaluing their currency and they're killing our companies.
0.0	0.449658679178	And I recognize -- I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa.
0.0	0.259664312388	They're going to end up in the productive economy, which is where we want them.
0.0	0.139882965885	But judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.00851543019341	Thank you.
0.0	0.201773863926	We need a fighter for this country again.
0.0	0.507244987823	But it is a general economic issue.
0.0	0.38221504767	Actually a close friend.
0.0	0.265470052771	I'm just saying.
0.0	0.167481408125	I think the times are different now.
0.0	0.348355595948	I like Marco too, and two years ago, he called me a conservative reformer that New Jersey needed.
0.0	0.216008125785	Let people play, who cares?
0.0	0.85556551689	We've saved billions of dollars.
0.0	0.269677196996	We're going to have people come in, but they're coming in legally.
0.0	0.272989793364	The idea of 401(k)s. I have a small business that I set up.
0.0	0.0969695204539	And you can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.153324777649	But bottom line is: The president is right.
0.0	0.237387793036	We would still have LGBT people who get married on Saturday and get fired on Monday.
0.0	0.0924487659995	That's what they do, whether it's the San Bernardino attack or if it's these tragedies that take place, I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is.
0.0	0.12890385707	... he's really doing some bad...
0.0	0.313183606558	So, I'm proud of Senator Sanders, and his supporters.
0.0	0.11526397127	2016 is going to be a fight between conservatism, and a Democrat party that is undermining the very character of this nation.
0.0	0.579358813891	When we do business with China, they tax us.
0.0	0.638168515251	But the best way to close this gap is to modernize higher education so Americans have the skills for those jobs.
0.0	0.821873710323	Because seniors, if they are retired, are no longer earning an income from a job.
0.0	0.540809690537	I will cut this government down to size and hold it accountable, simplify the tax code, roll back the regulations that have been spewing out of Washington, D.C. for 50 years.
0.0	0.118275982762	That will be my mission as president.
0.0	0.702418569028	We have seniors out there who are scared to death because this Congress -- this one that we have right now, just stole $150 billion from the Social Security retirement fund to give it to the Social Security disability fund.
0.0	0.566800686133	Helping business make profits.
0.0	0.207962269952	And hopefully -- you know, Senator Graham, I -- I know where he's going to be on this, but we use Congress, and we use Congress to cut this funding.
0.0	0.250988074953	And that's why they have it in Europe, because it is a way to blindfolded the people, that's what Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.175864752204	But if you want someone to drive you home, I will get the job done and I will get you home.
0.0	0.306829113878	But it is absolutely fair and necessary for Americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average American family?
0.0	0.234664131961	There is a war against ISIS, not just against ISIS but against radical jihadists terrorists, and it is a war that they win or we win.
0.0	0.173997715789	I have many friends that deal with China.
0.0	0.0415022017643	Let's listen to them and let's not listen to our politicians.
0.0	0.077652283509	We have a serious problem with, as you know, with radical Islam.
0.0	0.278547707354	Look, we are fighting for every vote that we can get from women, from men, straight, gay, African-Americans, Latinos, Asian-Americans.
0.0	0.288248534164	No, you did.
0.0	0.586272584516	We've cut taxes, balanced budgets, changed the regulatory environment.
0.0	0.0386298942753	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.375333676905	We now have much more information about what must be done to fix our criminal justice system.
0.0	0.729488162485	However, we saved 80,000 jobs and we went on to grow to 160,000 jobs, and scores of technology companies literally went out of business -- like Gateway -- taking all their jobs with them.
0.0	0.360060418829	When I am president, I will work consistently every single day to keep this country safe, not call Edward Snowden, as you did, a great public servant.
0.0	0.564312534032	These folks, CNBC, they had it down at three, three and a half hours.
0.0	0.0642001039724	It never happens.
0.0	0.662325759807	Those jobs, in many cases, are now gone.
0.0	0.0497881367509	...numerically, it's gonna be higher.
0.0	0.285644446127	The isolationist is the one who wants to continue to follow a foreign policy that has fewer democracies today than when Barack Obama came into office around the world.
0.0	0.229204965002	You know, we have to stop this because, you know, if we manage to damage ourselves, and we lose the next election, and a progressive gets in there and they get two or three Supreme Court picks, this nation is over as we know it.
0.0	0.111309067239	The fact is, there is a big overhang.
0.0	0.162738208678	But now as I travel the country, people say what I feel.
0.0	0.196762537041	It is absolutely absurd to say that I had any kind of a relationship with them.
0.0	0.545800466961	And what you're going to see in Washington this week is establishment Republicans have made an agreement with the president to raise the debt ceiling in an unlimited fashion; no limit to the debt ceiling raise.
0.0	0.424949744687	We have to put the personnel on that border in the right places; you have to put the strategic fencing in place; and you have to have aviation assets that fly all the way from Tijuana to El Paso to Brownsville, Texas -- 1,933 miles looking down 24/7, with the technology to be able to identify what individuals are doing, and ID when they are in obviously illegal activities or suspicious activities, and quick response teams come.
0.0	0.367035061361	And worse -- worse yet, to be honest with you, Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster.
0.0	0.177013249161	We're laughed at all over the world.
0.0	0.468460886727	And second, the international crisis we are facing is most dreadful and most dangerous.
0.0	0.0645273559287	...we need to honor our promises...
0.0	0.288248534164	...
0.0	0.451181636883	But we can do is defund Planned Parenthood, and by the way, put in place an absolute permanent ban on any taxpayer dollars ever being used to fund abortions.
0.0	0.145250695121	They don't like NBC, but I like the poll.
0.0	0.5	Now, I'm the only person that's put out a detailed plan on how to deal with entitlements.
0.0	0.199228493992	...The only way we're going to be morale, the only way we're going to keep our promise to seniors is start by following the first rule we should all follow, which is to look at them, treat them like adults, and tell them the truth.
0.0	0.114180513337	What we know is we're living longer.
0.0	0.292220002269	But in addition to that, we have to have fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.143482940796	I think that sets us apart from a lot of what's happening right now on the Republican side.
0.0	0.893221296494	... and here's the critical point, Maria -- the business flat tax enables us to abolish the corporate income tax, the death tax, the Obamacare taxes, the payroll taxes, and they're border-adjustable, so every export pays no taxes whatsoever.
0.0	0.288454787603	Planned Parenthood had better hope that Hillary Clinton wins this election, because I guarantee under President Jindal, January 2017, the Department of Justice and the IRS and everybody else that we can send from the federal government will be going in to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.900275498116	When I left the workforce, New York State had been reduced by over 15 percent.
0.0	0.157096495513	That's not the way the game is supposed to be played.
0.0	0.606340565883	Because we work with the private sector to make solar energy affordable and available to businesses and individuals in our state.
0.0	0.361061481514	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.715218817585	I sell tens' of millions of (inaudible).
0.0	0.571665306644	And remember this, after Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have had nearly 8 years, we have fewer democracies in the world than we had when they started.
0.0	0.117515126323	I am against the raids.
0.0	0.245999375947	I don't think it's a war on women for all of us as Americans to stand up and stop harvesting organs from little babies.
0.0	0.263529960691	It's the most exceptional country the world has ever known.
0.0	0.158134790551	The answer is no.
0.0	0.405927495271	As a senator, yes, I was a senator.
0.0	0.858720775456	The statistics from Wisconsin are particularly troubling, because it is the highest rate of incarceration for African-Americans in our nation, twice the national average.
0.0	0.37030033596	And if we can do that in Texas, that 12th largest economy in the world, we can do it in America.
0.0	0.184265938067	I'm very angry because our country is being run horribly and I will gladly accept the mantle of anger.
0.0	0.353773858697	What we should do is to be investing in all types of energy, John, all types of energy.
0.0	0.359541033896	And Lehman Brothers started it all.
0.0	0.269246426918	But if that's the best the New York Times has got, they better go back to the well.
0.0	0.181480506255	I was a child of Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.164726071694	Which is what we're gonna get if we elect a big government liberal like Hillary Clinton to the White House.
0.0	0.104920828423	No, he doesn't.
0.0	0.563068806733	I have the experience as a prosecutor, attorney general, governor, United States Army intelligence veteran, governor during the 9/11 attack, chairman of the Terrorism Commission for this country.
0.0	0.186373736262	I think he would have said bring back a 21st-century Glass-Steagall legislation.
0.0	0.518601073989	But we have to restore policing that will actually protect the communities that police officers are sworn to protect.
0.0	0.130812515512	That's what he talked about, the great threat of China.
0.0	0.139904606395	And they say down as a group trying to make sure that we can begin to heal some of these problems that we see between community and police.
0.0	0.0905788762003	And then what he did is redefine the role of government.
0.0	0.180450276191	He has got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.294522055272	And that is what's so critical for our neighborhoods, our families, our children, and our grandchildren.
0.0	0.281663704875	But, the real issue, I think, that the Senator is injecting into this is that if you had a Super PAC, like President Obama has, which now says it wants to support me.
0.0	0.150443275038	It is hard to find someone in my generation that thinks Social Security will be there for us.
0.0	0.0990860604086	And I'll tell you, it was heartbreaking.
0.0	0.267285421598	In my world, we'll focus on energy independence and a clean environment.
0.0	0.288248534164	No.
0.0	0.135975987846	Let me conclude by just saying this.
0.0	0.151200060127	And they consorted with Barack Obama to steal from Social Security.
0.0	0.269893407037	And first of all, we've got to recognize that there is problem that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have caused.
0.0	0.520515954802	I will tell you, you could win a bet at a bar tonight, since we're talking about fantasy football, if you ask who the top three states in America are that produce solar energy: California and Arizona are easy, but number three is New Jersey.
0.0	0.0998274393184	He has gone to China.
1.0	0.70782004289	Think about it: six and a half million people working part-time.
0.0	0.599056655864	They attacked us in Philadelphia last week.
0.0	0.933257730436	And it costs, with dynamic scoring, less than a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.306829471509	I would say the message that got us the win in Iowa and 10 other states against pretty overwhelming odds, is the message that's going to deliver us in this election.
0.0	0.178607879253	So, we are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we have to root out in our society.
0.0	0.356160576835	My name was mentioned.
0.0	0.636679121227	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.288248534164	No their not.
0.0	0.623046027228	That's why I'm running for office because when I become president of the United States, on my first day in office we are going to repeal every single one of his unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.194606252218	This is the first priority.
0.0	0.214034704729	And we can't be the stupid country any more.
1.0	0.970071951758	They were wrong.
0.0	0.59950398138	A 100, 150 years ago incredibly brave Americans said, you know what, working class kids, low income kids should not have to work in factories or on the farms.
0.0	0.139695933534	As you too know, I know I built a very great company.
0.0	0.134587955749	We have to work with NATO to protect Eastern Europe against any kind of Russian aggression.
0.0	0.0523588118807	And the fact is that that's not a democracy.
0.0	0.5	I'm very proud of the fact that we have more than 750 thousand donors, and the vast majority of them are giving small contributions.
1.0	0.973088646189	You used to say that you were in favor of birthright citizenship, now you say that you are against it.
0.0	0.361438782412	I think Americans want someone to have a track record of showing them how to get this country back on record, someone who will stand up and every day project that best days of America are in front of us.
0.0	0.429127218423	And I give you my word, if I am elected president, no service man or service woman will be forced to be on their knees, and any nation that captures our fighting men will feel the full force and fury of the United States of America.
0.0	0.615210711303	They told you that your Social Security money is in a trust fund.
0.0	0.0372771243635	I know this, I certainly am.
0.0	0.0485980234575	On welfare.
0.0	0.127963105164	It's peanuts.
0.0	0.120762289049	There are other racial discrepancies.
0.0	0.210055070715	They recognize that people's actions don't always match their words.
0.0	0.342203229717	13 Hours -- tomorrow morning, a new movie will debut about the incredible bravery of the men fighting for their lives in Benghazi and the politicians that abandoned them.
0.0	0.985759969116	I went into Ohio where we had an $8 billion hole and now we have a $2 billion surplus.
0.0	0.118273199689	You're not interested in an answer.
0.0	0.0912963674861	Because I've done it.
0.0	0.043514028981	And that's really a theme of a lot of the things that I'm talking about.
0.0	0.530162429043	Well, I wish you would have asked that question years ago when they broke it.
0.0	0.262328491853	I think what President Obama did was to exemplify the importance of this issue as our first African American president, and to address it both from the President's office, and through his advocacy, such as working with young men, and Mrs. Obama's work with young women.
0.0	0.211613653121	Iran sanctions -- the Iran sanctions that brought them to the table, those are sanctions that we put in place when I was in the United States Senate, and a whole host of other things that put me in a position of saying, I not only have a great vision, but I can govern effectively in Washington.
0.0	0.167242536409	Our rights come from God.
0.0	0.139937445446	The result of that, you had the Iranian Revolution coming in, and that is where we are today.
0.0	0.102975317025	And I think the focus ought to be on making sure that we leave this nomination process, as wild and woolly as it's going to be -- this is not being bad.
0.0	0.4072843499	They're a feeding frenzy for sick people.
0.0	0.76394481012	And remember this -- I'm credible on this for this reason: Americans for Tax Reform says that I've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history.
0.0	0.382727627277	You know, in recent travels around this country, I've encountered so many Americans who are discouraged and angry as they watch our freedom, our security and the American dream slipping away under an unresponsive government that is populated by bureaucrats and special interest groups.
0.0	0.095277919748	And I've got to tell you, it sounded like everything in the world was going amazing, you know?
0.0	0.417433384163	And you know, when you see Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and all the Democrats talking about wanting to address the plight of working women, not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama, 3.7 million women have entered poverty.
0.0	0.582518592907	We're bringing corporate taxes down, bringing money back in, corporate inversions.
0.0	0.844523514197	And you wanted to know the numbers, the Tax Foundation, which has scored every one of our plans, shows that this plan will allow the economy to generate 4.9 million jobs, to raise wages over 12 percent, and to generate 14 percent growth.
0.0	0.280042468111	It is time to believe in America again.
0.0	0.283748021026	So that is not by any stretch a pie in the sky.
0.0	0.519153005805	And, then we have to go after sentencing, and that's one of the problems here in Wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn't happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level.
0.0	0.288248534164	...
0.0	0.299976853655	Or, are you going to deal with the problem by saying, I'm going to give people who've done well in this country less benefit on the backend.
0.0	0.13881945858	Our vets are being treated horribly.
0.0	0.288248534164	Why?
0.0	0.0240441787992	I'll check for you.
0.0	0.216490415523	Well, there is no evidence that they can fix anything in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.0665116984679	Not the change we need at a time we need it.
0.0	0.181621913671	And that's what we should focus on is the violence in our communities.
0.0	0.25651802772	And listen, there are many, many wonderful, wonderful working men and women in the state of New York.
0.0	0.462356452928	So, yes, I do believe that when we talk about public education in America, today, in a rapidly changing world, we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities.
0.0	0.288248534164	So...
0.0	0.18954745419	For the people who say we can't do it, I say hell no, we can do it together.
0.0	0.353330744251	And it creates a -- a contempt for the law, for the rule of law.
0.0	0.3273752188	According to the generals that I know and trust, this air campaign will not destroy ISIL.
0.0	0.530637041459	CLINTON: Judy, I think that the best analysis that I've seen based on Senator Sanders plans is that it would probably increase the size of the federal government by about 40%, but what is most concerning to me is that in looking at the plans -- let's take healthcare for example.
0.0	0.365182187522	But also where it's affordable, solar, wind in Iowa has become very affordable and it makes sense.
0.0	0.860929161756	They will also have to pay 16 percent on the money they pay their employees.
0.0	0.539248831566	We have arrived at a point in our nation's history where the potential of this nation and too many Americans is being crushed by the weight, the power, the cost, the complexity, the ineptitude, the corruption of the federal government, and only someone who will challenge the status quo of Washington, D.C. can lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.211375722467	And you combine that with reforms of our welfare system.
0.0	0.400901132627	Or how about Boeing right here within a mile?
0.0	0.288248534164	But...
0.0	0.186048132765	A politician other than the people in the states -- I don't want to -- a politician cannot get them to pay.
0.0	0.333437762583	That's essentially what we have now, and we don't need that.
0.0	0.390659090103	That expertise needs to spread all across the government and there needs to be much more cooperation with our private sector.
1.0	0.322456930829	We don't need the federal government to be involved in this at all.
0.0	0.171675008178	Your prosecute criminals.
0.0	0.0279028691225	They do whatever what they do, OK.
0.0	0.527640178143	The issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24 months ago.
0.0	0.344545064233	They are radicalizing people in the United States, they are conducting attacks around the world.
0.0	0.266294029331	And not only did I fight them and win, I lived to tell about it and I'm standing on this stage tonight as evidence of that.
0.0	0.298084281038	Neil, I was mentioned too.
0.0	0.492078830804	There is no money, it's a stack of paper.
0.0	0.62035209083	In my own state, for example, we launched an investigation, asked the FBI to cooperate.
0.0	0.486183967064	The fact is, in order to get this economy moving again, I call for freezing regulations for a year except for the problem of public safety.
0.0	0.148522554143	And let me say this also.

0.0	0.0661619729957	I have a feeling it's going to work out, actually.
0.0	0.2653537593	Well, there's no question that ISIS is a very serious problem, and I don't believe that this administration recognizes how serious it is.
0.0	0.0902289457873	You know, let me say something at the outset.
0.0	0.5	That is principally an American-led air campaign that we are now engaged in.
0.0	0.434457796574	Suicide, alcoholism, drugs, that's why we need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country, and not just a handful of billionaires who have enormous economic and political power.
0.0	0.219838229215	We will rebuild the military to make sure that it is a solid force, not to be the world's policeman, but to make sure that in a peaceful world, people know that the United States is there to take care of our own national interests and take care of our allies.
0.0	0.36581919347	A healthy environment, a strong economy and energy independent America -- that would be the purpose of my presidency, is break the strangle hold that people enjoy on fossil fuels who hate our guts.

0.0	0.427232871999	Look, every time the Federal Government gets engaged in something it gets worse.
0.0	0.396082943505	And I will suggest to you nobody's done it like Rick Perry has done it over the last eight years.
0.0	0.304741861911	...in the world for people...
0.0	0.320652070807	The reason I did so well last time is not just because of the vision, it's because I have a track record in Washington, D.C. of getting things done.
0.0	0.104920828423	I didn't.
0.0	0.0336301401368	That is what I believe.

0.0	0.0221143217439	HEMMER: Wow.
0.0	0.121669426527	Well, I'm very happy to get a question this early on.
0.0	0.0786893195753	But we have a serious problem.
0.0	0.19190434093	That's absurd, and I think people who don't want to fix it, really, or unwilling to take the chance to say, "something has to change," are missing the boat here.
0.0	0.178485975676	Let's quit making it a problem for them.
0.0	0.0223901772779	I know how to do that.
0.0	0.0204454438203	We need Jordan.
0.0	0.321130988869	And then we need to shut down -- we need to shut down their mechanisms of funding and attack their command-and-control centers.
0.0	0.263699914099	You spend the money today and then you hope you're going to save money tomorrow.
0.0	0.389201178879	Part of the reason why it hasn't risen because sometimes we're not giving people the skills they need.
0.0	0.137606368876	And then the Government steps in to try and solve the problem and we get a little further down to that progressive vision that Hillary Clinton is talking about.
0.0	0.134447543103	And on this issue of the Medicare in particular, it's important because they're going to demagogue what we're saying here tonight.
0.0	0.249259796566	And it's something that can be done, and I get questioned about that.
0.0	0.0808486944831	I think he's tapped into an anger that people feel.
0.0	0.0719505845767	So, we have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.581475830397	We owned a liquor store, restaurant, bar and we lived in the back.
0.0	0.300078284246	Eradicate those and you fix Medicare and you've fixed America, its economy and you've made people's lives a heck of a lot better.
0.0	0.319394101769	We need to lead a force, a Sunni led force inside of Syria.
0.0	0.331390638945	Why not go to Congress and in a bipartisan way, begin to deal with the process of mental health issues so that people that are spiraling out of control because of mental health challenges don't have access to guns.
0.0	0.5	Here's -- apart from the -- apart from the higher prices on consumers and people are living paycheck to paycheck, apart from that, there will be retaliation.
0.0	0.300921614933	And, you know the old inscription, if you save one life, you've changed the world.
0.0	0.350108433337	The New York Times a few weeks back had a columnist who wrote a column saying, "Anybody But Cruz."
0.0	0.356677316224	In her world, cap- and-trade would dominate, that we will destroy the economy in the name of helping the environment.
0.0	0.283566927862	You can trust me to do the following: that when I get on change with Hillary Clinton, we won't be debating about the science, we'll be debating about the solutions.
0.0	0.0773602856228	I want to talk to the folks at home.
0.0	0.355551007797	I'm the only one on this stage who has a plan that's actually reduced -- actually going to reduce immigration.

0.0	0.451466723653	And what I have concluded is that the best policy is to get rid of all government subsidies, and get the government out of our lives, and let people rise and fall based on how good they are.
0.0	0.229630841464	And this president, given what Ted said right at the beginning, he's absolutely right.
0.0	0.297437940079	Yeah, I would go, first of all, one step further in this description of Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.195501258244	Judy, if I can, there is no question, Secretary Clinton and I are friends, and I have a lot of respect for her, that she has enormous experience in foreign affairs.

0.0	0.21341115748	I was one of the original sponsors of the DREAM Act.
0.0	0.531742288441	If my memory is correct, I think when we saw children coming from these horrendous, horrendously violent areas of Honduras and neighboring countries, people who are fleeing drug violence and cartel violence, I thought it was a good idea to allow those children to stay in this country.
0.0	0.104644145557	So you should go out, get a declaratory judgment, let the courts decide.
0.0	0.187913881846	We have Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view.

0.0	0.331065726961	I came to Washington, D.C. in 1990.

0.0	0.7842518635	When millions of Americans rose up against amnesty, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.165540260962	-- the issue is who is going to get it done.
0.0	0.0655089058996	We have a tremendous problem.
0.0	0.425188876909	And we know of the tragic, terrible event that lead to the death of Dontre Hamilton right here in Milwaukee, a young man unarmed, who should still be with us.
0.0	0.132819160104	The talk has got to stop, the action has got to begin.
0.0	0.0848499480815	Well, you know what?
0.0	0.187972455664	Well, it's an interesting question because I'm very proud of my company.
0.0	0.185570257854	And I also want to recognize the people in that church that showed the grace of God and the grace of forgiveness and the mercy that they showed.
0.0	0.360949006294	There is one major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.225610462981	No, not at all, absolutely not.
0.0	0.123951683395	I believe we should be appointing Supreme Court justices who will follow the law and not try to make the law.
0.0	0.60444200847	Well, I would suggest a fair tax system, and that's what we have proposed.
0.0	0.211931589365	I was governor of New York on September 11.
0.0	0.228539340379	Those aren't Iowa values, but this is what we believe in New York."
0.0	0.343020507369	This mandatory sentencing, a very bad idea.
0.0	0.39933729398	I agree with President Obama who used executive orders to protect families because the Congress, the House was unable or refused to act.
0.0	0.547001089128	I voted for comprehensive immigration reform in 2007.
0.0	0.0788441877736	It did not come from our Judeo-Christian roots, I can tell you that.
0.0	0.66245858378	But the greatest gains, percentage-wise, for people, are gonna be at the lower end of our plan, and here's why: because in addition to a general personal exemption, we are increasing the per-child tax credit for working families.
0.0	0.283884301888	But I think this is a worldwide -- that the entire world needs to come together to deal with this horrific refugee crisis we're seeing from Syria and Afghanistan, as well.
0.0	0.342527495387	And as president I would expand enormous energy, literally call every member of Congress that I thought I could persuade.
0.0	0.439209130248	This president has failed, and when I'm in the Oval Office, police officers will know that they will have the support of the president of the Untied States.
0.0	0.158220619839	I got the briefings.
0.0	0.172213594935	The fact of the matter is we the American people are not each other's enemies, it's those people who are trying to divide us who are the enemies.
0.0	0.337495073313	I know a lot of Americans are angry about the economy.
0.0	0.381097255201	The choice between a weak economy and a strong environment is a false choice, that is not the choice I'll offer America.
0.0	0.649284204858	I understand both of these issues, how to build the economy and doing that as a governor who'd built jobs, had cut taxes and also a governor who understands foreign-policy, and that's why I entered this race.
0.0	0.159355641095	I am not a member of the political class.
0.0	0.0793138390873	John, I'll tell you something.
0.0	0.0846381767193	We need a president who can solve our problems, bring us together.
0.0	0.669228120626	We can save and preserve and strengthen Social Security by making no changes for seniors, but for younger workers gradually increasing the retirement age, changing the rate of growth so that it matches inflation, and critically allowing younger workers to keep a portion of our tax payments in a personal account that we own, we control them, we can pass on to our kids.
0.0	0.282789046636	If they don't treat us fairly, hey, their whole trade is tariffed.
0.0	0.139223242818	Here's the way you need to deal with it.
0.0	0.376143262791	We need a ground force in Iraq and Syria, and America has to be part of that ground force.
0.0	0.547965228202	We've all been talking about tax reforms tonight, and paying for infrastructure is caught right up in tax reform.
0.0	0.522113420522	It's the reason why I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and led the fight to stop the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, because it was clear then, like it's clear now, that border security is national security.
0.0	0.481427943521	So you know, I had to report results every 90 days in excruciating detail.
0.0	0.334538547713	They don't like somebody else like David Petraeus, they prosecute them and send a decorated general on to disgrace.
0.0	0.648221495571	I've had the growth code (ph) there for about five years, and it's this specific program.
0.0	0.438648985091	And this president turns his back -- this president doesn't enforce the marijuana laws in this country because he doesn't agree with them.
0.0	0.732864911986	I wanna tell you, in my state, we took Medicaid, the hardest program to control, and we took it from a 10 percent growth rate to 2.5 percent without taking one person off the rolls or cutting one single benefit.
0.0	0.132680155545	What else we can do is that we should believe in science.
0.0	0.0132096281302	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.106620343856	And at that point, it's a life that we have the right to protect, and I think we should protect.
0.0	0.5	At that particular point in time, then Americans will believe that Washington is up to a conversation to deal with the millions of people that are here illegally, but not until.
0.0	0.200774872014	(inaudible), the great majority of Republicans and Americans believe in a hopeful future.
0.0	0.0324255383655	So you might not.
0.0	0.288248534164	It was the AFL-CIO.
0.0	0.079423944893	So we have work to do.
0.0	0.0104794956695	With all the candidates, why me?
0.0	0.290142418387	So I have nothing at all critical of him.
0.0	0.66446646439	In the first day in office, my first executive order, I revoked every one of the executive orders that he had -- he had enacted over the prior 12 years.
0.0	0.464763605656	And here's an area where Secretary Clinton and I believe we have a difference.
0.0	0.183860410299	Because it wouldn't work.
0.0	0.151813666807	I don't see a lot of weakness on this stage, quite frankly.
0.0	0.20744510162	The way to take that away from them is to talk to our military officials and ask them, "what do you need in order to accomplish this goal?"
0.0	0.909258413058	And the only reason we got them back is because we owed them with a stupid deal, $150 billion.
0.0	0.379797842132	And then in addition to that, the American people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.333937817104	When people ask me, whose fault is it?
0.0	0.41199601463	One thing I like to remind people is, back in 2007, Rudy Giuliani was leading the polls for almost a year.
0.0	0.406652056351	Today, we have a legal immigration system for permanent residency that is largely based on whether or not you have a relative living here.
0.0	0.0389441461778	I'm ready.
0.0	0.158955665987	Or somebody else.
0.0	0.0730474049312	John, could I follow up on this?
0.0	0.229915657657	I say, yes, not only do we give them what they need, but we don't tie their hands behind their backs so that they can go ahead and get the job done.
0.0	0.366882533152	We're on the verge of being the first generation of Americans that leave our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.317806268491	Larry Kudlow is an example, who I have a lot of respect for, who loves my tax plan.
0.0	0.555160186234	African-Americans who face discrimination in the job market, education, housing, and the criminal justice system.
0.0	0.823966431978	The rate -- the rate -- the rate is gonna be much closer to 15 percent.
0.0	0.494896662516	And believe me, Assad is not worth it.
0.0	0.254405548807	So don't put people in there if you don't want them bombed.
0.0	0.0350599411242	And you know, he's right.
0.0	0.343870819887	Yes, they have to stop trying to destabilize the Middle East, causing even more chaos.
0.0	0.171401642299	You can't just ban all Muslims.
0.0	0.301758165972	The entire system of legal immigration must now be reexamined for security first and foremost, with an eye on ISIS.
0.0	0.20247070268	This isn't -- this isn't, you know, a different kind of job.
0.0	0.0223901772779	You know why?
0.0	0.0792035574103	Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point?
0.0	0.329285591968	We need to break the Washington cartel, and the only way to do it is to end all the subsidies and all...
0.0	0.358005898343	I also believe that marriage is between one man and one woman.
0.0	0.0605753649966	And I think together we will make progress.
0.0	0.238285172908	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.0999349193556	John, do you want me to answer or do you want to answer?
0.0	0.448979583916	I don't think it's so much about when the government orders a corporation to do something.
0.0	0.364311013811	Maria, you look at what this president and his secretary of state, Secretary of State Clinton, has done to get us in this spot.
0.0	0.71644470385	Do you think that the Chinese, if they had a 45 percent tariff imposed on all their imports wouldn't retaliate and start buying Airbus?
0.0	0.312901538591	And, this is what I am finding throughout America.
0.0	0.333983855791	And when you have insider information, which apparently has been the case, where people use that information and use big data to try to take advantage of it, there has to be some regulation.
0.0	0.157585252062	I think it is fair to say, whatever the complaints that you want to make about him are, that with respect to China, one of the most challenging relationships we have, his opening up China and his ongoing relationships with the leaders of China is an incredibly useful relationship for the United States of America.
0.0	0.230594666421	We need fundamental police reform, clearly, clearly, when we talk about a criminal justice system.
0.0	0.688991650431	You'll create a much better graduation rate at a lower cost, and you won't in debt the next generation with recourse debt on their backs.
0.0	0.338681444655	Are you fed up with how Washington wastes your money?
0.0	0.27776023469	Over time, we're going to become energy independent.
0.0	0.840456386207	Keeping the government open and continuing to borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.635883627908	We have to end crony capitalism in Washington, where the lobbyists and the powerful can get tax breaks and tax credits, and the American people don't get laws in their interest.
0.0	0.290275747043	First of all, I'd like to recognize Governor Haley for her incredible leadership in the aftermath of the --
0.0	0.613977316496	No, I oppose it because you're taking money from the entitlement and then spending it immediately on other items.
0.0	0.219055435826	You know, in our country, there are a lot of people who feel as though they just don't have the power.
0.0	0.107396240548	That will change everything.
0.0	0.220958333916	Let's let a Justice Department -- and I will make an attorney general who will enforce the law and make justice more than just a word.
0.0	0.288248534164	Why is that?
0.0	0.14566629728	And wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong.
0.0	0.250028537969	But they need to see leadership, support and resolve from the United States of America, and we can help them defeat ISIS.
0.0	0.656103186665	One as a marine officer in Iraq, one as an army officer in Afghanistan.
0.0	0.510667460713	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the free enterprise system.
0.0	0.0670972779608	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.699577810638	I have worked with President Obama for the last seven years.
0.0	0.0828230498974	I think the American people are look for real leadership.
0.0	0.0265962909591	John?
0.0	0.212454733824	And so Senator Graham is right about this.
0.0	0.411932981541	We need to make the government run smarter and better, and reform this corporate tax system, bring that money back to the United States to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, and we need to use it also to protect our grid from terrorists.
0.0	0.449035368347	And, if this government doesn't pay it, than tell me what's different between the government and Bernie Madolf, who sits in prison today for doing less than what the government has done to the people on social security and Medicare in this country.
0.0	0.166539977632	Now, what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next.
0.0	0.333617849438	It is broke, it is not working.
0.0	0.0943217542764	The fact of the matter is we're not going to have peace -- we are not going to have peace in Syria.
0.0	0.291389930076	When I'm president of the United States we are getting rid of Obamacare and we are rebuilding our military.
0.0	0.482853587191	They attacked us in San Bernardino two weeks ago.
0.0	0.11259854132	It takes away discretion from judges.
0.0	0.0669272382437	That's what they're doing.
1.0	0.531592590546	And I know this, because when I ran for governor of New York, one in 11 of every man, woman, and child in the state of New York was on welfare.
0.0	0.245631921994	We need a president that doesn't just talk a game, but a president that's got real results.
0.0	0.261526297336	We put in place child care support.
0.0	0.24589889825	I want to find out -- many people saw pipe bombs and all sorts of things all over their apartment.
0.0	0.403059999143	And the same goes for overseas, where we have to put together a coalition of Muslim nations.
0.0	0.288248534164	These...
0.0	0.424730464155	Total propaganda.
0.0	0.2445264513	Not keeping the government open.
0.0	0.269998005917	We have to go after terrorist networks, predominantly ISIS -- that's not the only one, but let's focus on that for a minute.
0.0	0.605249890455	And I think that the record of the governor of the last 14 years of the 12th largest economy in the world is just the medicine America is looking for.
0.0	0.0920007110692	Yes.
0.0	0.133608926772	What you saw was a parade of, "I'll give you this for free; I'll give you that for free."
0.0	0.265026868598	And, people are sick of believing that the government is never going to really address this.
0.0	0.438861696487	If you saw that blimp that got cut loose from Maryland today, it's a perfect example of government.
0.0	0.206749997349	We put in place mandatory work fair (ph).
0.0	0.476150488085	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.730877660905	We are lowering taxes on small business.
0.0	0.381724702	I know for a fact how difficult it is to raise children, how expensive it's become for working families.
0.0	0.411521348026	You know, a minute ago, Neil asked: What has President Obama do -- done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns?
0.0	0.3978216147	Secretary Clinton has been going around the country saying Bernie Sanders wants to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, people are going to lose their MedicAid, they're going to lose their CHIP program.
0.0	0.0632226060158	There are lids on people's aspirations.
0.0	0.541980029731	...Rand is exactly right.
0.0	0.319683283915	But the ideal scenario is to train Americans to do the work so we don't have to rely on people from abroad.
0.0	0.376570719087	But in 2015, we have a very different economy.
0.0	0.0407248430957	I will do that in Washington.
0.0	0.475308034582	We're going to get more revenue.
0.0	0.41568771171	And I've done it in the state of Ohio as the chief executive.
0.0	0.08342264554	This is an interesting point when you talk about immigration.
0.0	0.17233536791	I'm going to go to the commanders and say give me a plan to win.
0.0	0.614559225206	But nobody can deny that as a wartime leader, he rallied the British people when they stood virtually alone against the Nazi juggernaut and rallied them and eventually won an extraordinary victory.
0.0	0.169757443411	...Then I'll buy you a tequila...
0.0	0.23381231754	You look at the kind of damage that two people that two people that got married, they were radicalized -- they got married, they killed 15 people in actually 15 -- going to be probably 16 but you look at that and you take a look -- a good strong look and that's what we have.
0.0	0.575383421311	We can reform those entitlements, we can change that corporate tax code and lower it.
1.0	0.648756024816	Six million more people living in poverty than the day that Barack Obama got elected president, and the left just wants more of the same.
0.0	0.100085709412	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.462972419393	The president has done an executive order with respect to illegal immigration that is illegal.
0.0	0.423444499091	Karen and I have seven children.
0.0	0.0481977620017	I would change them.
0.0	0.5	We cannot afford four more years of on the job training.
0.0	0.0032512577452	But look...
0.0	0.13570986087	This is not some small scale group.
0.0	0.467428236366	How about Obamacare, a certified job killer?
0.0	0.136993569504	Well, I don't know.
0.0	0.120843678155	So the indignation that you carry on, some of the stuff, you have to also own then.
0.0	0.394049355921	They should be running all the time, then they won't have time to plan attacks against us.
0.0	0.896662637117	And every single income decile sees a double-digit increase in after-tax income.
0.0	0.21471537074	I'm not fighting that.
0.0	0.212841042985	I said no.
0.0	0.299336329696	So this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement.
0.0	0.436450621854	When I was 21, my mom died.
0.0	0.377458218409	They have to come into this country legally.
0.0	0.288248534164	That is...
0.0	0.159140816379	Here's the bottom line, and I'll close with this.
0.0	0.225732119943	Make our police officers proud of what they do but more important than that, let them know how proud we are of them."
0.0	0.288248534164	I have...
0.0	0.19755376168	Here is the case, they both agree, they can't make a deal.
0.0	0.145555702979	That is absolutely not right.
0.0	0.157356343771	Yes, it's very simple.
0.0	0.270859509842	And when it comes to the issues that are really on the front lines as to whether we're going to have equal pay, paid family leave, some opportunity for, you know, women to go as far as their hard work and talent take them, I think that we still have some barriers to knock down, which is why that's at the core of my campaign.
0.0	0.641474718749	We're asking the top 1.5 percent, including passive income, to start paying a little bit more so that the elderly and disabled vets in this country can live with security and dignity.
0.0	0.999997344576	... of $50 billion...
0.0	0.247317475889	So you don't get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.146235640722	Just want to get that out there, just saying.
0.0	0.328132746151	Well, first of all, like many other very big businessmen, I could name them here, but I'm not going to do that for a lot of obvious reasons, but the biggest, and almost all of them, they've all used the chapter laws, the bankruptcy laws to their own benefit.
0.0	0.122592861828	Bernie Sanders, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.
0.0	0.216412962053	Let me just close it out this way.
0.0	0.483369578806	They're taking money from Social Security and they're going to spend it on the military and they're going to spend it on domestic spending.
0.0	0.0181607331481	I think that's a mistake.
0.0	0.418114486463	Manufacturing will flow back into this country.
0.0	0.0223901772779	And you know what?
0.0	0.054730956277	One thing I want to be clear about tonight.
1.0	0.305010060566	He said, "we don't have leverage with China to get a better deal on Iran because we need them to lend us money to continue operating our government."
0.0	0.150101631537	There's no way he launches 11 attack --

0.0	0.37828440079	Secondly, a policy on recruiting and hiring, and then more resources for -- for training.
0.0	0.215975568234	But the president leads in this regard.

0.0	0.201365939528	We should be relying upon the leadership of the Congress to pass the laws.
0.0	0.215165447038	And -- and -- and I -- you know, Ben is absolutely right in saying that what we don't need to do is to send more money to Washington, D.C. to fix this problem.
0.0	0.446707456821	If I could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited.

0.0	0.0806296758965	But let's not kid ourselves.
0.0	0.310871412265	We need to be very well aware of the fact that China and Russia are using technology to attack us, just as ISIS is using technology to recruit those who would murder American citizens.
0.0	0.398273868427	I far prefer that and the chances we have to be successful there than trying to start all over again, gridlocking our system, and trying to get from zero to 100 percent.

0.0	0.939772245898	They pay tax once overseas.
0.0	0.356017722805	And it was with us for months, the smell, the air.
0.0	0.231806804179	I was a governor during the 9/11 attack.
0.0	0.114612078888	The more the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected are advantaged.
0.0	0.681183062336	Truth is that far more blacks get stopped for traffic violations.
0.0	0.154434566263	We honest to god are here to get this country back on track.
0.0	0.137029721108	We've got a president who instead says, we're going to change hearts and minds.
0.0	0.116104517345	On the issue of Barack Obama, Barack Obama does not believe that America is a great global power.
0.0	0.05498715912	They are not perfect.
0.0	0.450219332476	Probably in terms of the applying for the job of president, a weakness would be not really seeing myself in that position until hundreds of thousands of people began to tell me that I needed to do it.
0.0	0.336527298169	Well, he appointed Eric Holder as attorney general.
0.0	0.113832073332	And I think this has become something that needs to be looked at in terms of regulation.
0.0	0.183711913927	We actually did it.
0.0	0.371372656591	Now, thank God, my father was invited to a Bible study and became born again and he came back to my mom and me and we were raised together.
0.0	0.266336274811	Instead, the Washington establishment raised both.
0.0	0.0735009913554	I can't do it.
0.0	0.124648615241	You know, whatever your issue, your cause, the festering problem you hoped would resolved, the political class has failed you.
0.0	0.411309957732	Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns.
0.0	0.169674752849	What have you got now?
0.0	0.170942384357	Well, I'm just not sure I agree completely with that assessment.
0.0	0.0251933999015	So I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.171655061046	And if you become the nominee, who the hell knows if you can even serve in office?
0.0	0.249728948939	At the core of that resolution is an agreement I negotiated in June of 2012 in Geneva, which set forth a cease-fire and moving toward a political resolution, trying to bring the parties at stake in Syria together.

0.0	0.281063924877	Maria -- Maria, what you were talking about just now is called corporate inversion.
0.0	0.191487201128	We've got to stop this culture of government dependence.
0.0	0.575680953656	We should reimpose sanctions, they've already violated sanctions after this agreement was signed by testing medium-range missiles.

0.0	0.148532689424	You know, Hillary Clinton's always saying how Republicans don't follow science?
0.0	0.0841678755877	You know, that's so simple.
0.0	0.00851543019341	Thank you.
0.0	0.0847825773544	I think that's a major accomplishment.

0.0	0.246007087378	People aren't dumb.
0.0	0.419447463467	Well, it's not a matter of what the first executive order would be, Bill.
0.0	0.806358472117	Under my plan, no business, big or small, will pay more than 25 percent flat rate on their business income.
0.0	0.383222224877	They're very, very badly wounded.
0.0	0.0737965246566	And, thank you everybody.
0.0	0.718054451284	Roads, bridges, water systems, wastewater plants, who denies that?
0.0	0.585777444271	If you do that, you don't just change the economy, you transform the lives of millions of hurting Americans.
0.0	0.057250049906	I want to take care of women.
1.0	0.994836433095	Who denies that real unemployment today, including those who have given up looking for work and are working part-time is close to 10 percent?
0.0	0.219387924118	Because when government gets big and powerful, the big feel like they need to get even bigger to deal with all that power, and meanwhile, the small and the powerless -- in this case, 1,590 community banks -- go out of business.
1.0	0.788996311853	If you look at a single mom buying groceries, she sees hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent.

0.0	0.321604988234	That is total propaganda, and this is what happens in our society.
0.0	0.434909282518	This is a bad deal.
0.0	0.193485447129	We need to elect someone who will stand with the American people, who understands its greatness, who understands what an open economy and freedom is all about, but at the same time, has a record of being able to get things done in Washington like we've never seen before.
0.0	0.130904944088	Good luck making something out of this mess."
0.0	0.163240926055	We need sound money.
0.0	0.254677744211	So we do as the United States have to support our friends, our allies in Europe.
0.0	0.542129528436	Let me just say on taxes, how long have we been talking about tax reform in Washington, D.C.?
0.0	0.35047208499	That makes the world less peaceful, less safe.
0.0	0.181492492992	Oh yeah, we want to elect a good president, but America is great from the bottom-up, and the bottom-up is us in our families, in our communities, in our neighborhoods.
0.0	0.288741220679	I can tell you, there wouldn't have been much damage.
0.0	0.0552311228446	Thank you for that question.
0.0	0.15872433347	And that is wrong.
0.0	0.358301119982	My four children have been able to receive a good Christian education, and I've been able to save for them to go to college so they never have to have the loans that I did.
0.0	0.328076462296	Military action, Maria, would be used when it was absolutely necessary to protect American lives and protect American interests around the world.
0.0	0.267508498549	You get the Senate.
0.0	0.380691044911	I think to be commander in chief in the 21st century requires someone who understands how the economy works, someone who understands how the world works and who's in it; I know more world leaders on the stage today than anyone running, with the possible exception of Hillary Clinton; understands bureaucracies, how to cut them down to size and hold them accountable; and understands technology, which is a tool, but it's also a weapon that's being used against us.
0.0	0.245020933523	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.24003628694	Madam Secretary, that is a low blow.
0.0	0.153786261469	We're going to fight it as hard as we can, and we're going to fight whoever the Republicans nominate who will depend on the Koch Brothers, and others.
0.0	0.655901587956	The Children's Health Insurance Program, which I helped to create, which covers 8 million kids, is also a different kind of program.
0.0	0.0673742345631	China and Russia have never been on our side of the table.
0.0	0.0760784369767	But the voters are savvier than that.
0.0	0.745162827113	Focus on the diseases that are costing us the trillions of dollars.
0.0	0.345865373549	We sent our Texas ranger recon teams.
0.0	0.179452996749	But I would add this.
0.0	0.13254699334	So there's a lot of balanced interests.
0.0	0.123357817092	Yes, our allies are not perfect.
1.0	0.750998611227	And by the way, when I left, there were over 1 million fewer people on welfare in New York state than when I took office...
0.0	0.904246268676	Mine gives every American a simple, flat tax of 10 percent.
0.0	0.0504354698629	We are all frustrated with what China is doing.
0.0	0.5	People are being released from jail without the education, without the job training, without the resources that they need to get their lives together, then they end up -- we're shocked that they end up back in jail again.
0.0	0.171630482948	Well, obviously, you don't understand my views on homosexuality.
0.0	0.203674106959	But the good news is the next commander-in-chief is standing on this stage.
0.0	0.584455357688	Because the more you tax something, the less of it you get.
0.0	0.267395098857	We don't have to have refugees come to our country, but all Muslims, seriously?
0.0	0.00851543019341	Thank you.
0.0	0.348244475779	It will create a manufacturing juggernaut in this country.
0.0	0.259805312609	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.377626926332	I congratulate Secretary of State John Kerry and the president for working on this agreement.
0.0	0.678324167834	One of the great challenges that we have, $150 billion is fixing to go to a country that killed our Marines in Lebanon, that used their weapons to kill our young men in Iran.
0.0	0.315872919305	But I have no argument with anyone making up her mind about who to support.
1.0	0.949422021275	Strong, powerful men, young and people are looking at that and they're saying what's going on?
0.0	0.0923410149399	We have made it easier to do that, not harder.
0.0	0.133065198912	But the final thing I want to say about this is the following.
0.0	0.5	Bottom line is a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people, if Congress doesn't do the right thing, we use the executive orders of the president.
0.0	0.210000731282	We just can't do it any longer.
0.0	0.47040528461	This would be devastating for the economy.
0.0	0.207839773783	You know why three?
0.0	0.0610311797889	I want security.
0.0	0.313064467592	I believe I can get the money that I need by taxing the wealthy, by closing loopholes, the things that we are way overdue for doing.
0.0	0.5	We have to shut down their internet capability.
0.0	0.421834066017	What he said, and he said it in the last debate, it's simply not true.
0.0	0.885559067833	Now 16 percent is what the rate Ted wants it at.
0.0	0.6828088314	Last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee.
0.0	0.22277548534	Well, Senator, look, I think we're in vigorous agreement here.
0.0	0.330942204752	And here's what the economic issue is.
0.0	0.261931010906	Of course, they would.
0.0	0.0868710253226	There's a big question mark on your head.
0.0	0.447733847761	...eliminates the business...
0.0	0.392724966705	Let me tell you what I would do immediately, day two in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.113623532447	I'll give you a fact.
0.0	0.0378550955837	Progressives don't believe that.
0.0	0.0745959537133	We have been debating right here the core difference between conservatism and progressivism.
0.0	0.329728270123	Ours was intended to be a citizen government.
0.0	0.35967016063	You will also have to means-test the benefits and declare there's not enough money.
0.0	0.28817085669	The big corporations have the scale to deal with all of this.
1.0	0.605902204425	We can't afford to have another four years like the last eight years.
0.0	0.0576220781981	Can I tell you what?
0.0	0.251761760104	We need to make sure that we do everything across all kinds of energy: natural gas, oil, absolutely.
0.0	0.319264014172	You can campaign, or just resign and let someone else take the job.
0.0	0.643010044479	As a matter of fact, if you're Hispanic or African-American in Texas, you have the number one high school graduation rates in America.
0.0	0.20051413785	We cannot elect somebody that doesn't know how to do the job.
0.0	0.748747854576	So when you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration -- which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother -- clearly, we are looking at institutional racism.
0.0	0.149805366713	So as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and the like.
0.0	0.0420880180626	Oh, I'll talk about that, too.
0.0	0.26370515245	A person who, in fact, has a long experience in foreign-policy issues, which is different from many of the other governors and prospective governors who are running.
0.0	0.274700752822	You have regulations -- I mean, come on, they're affecting everybody here, particularly our small businesses.
1.0	0.915651418607	When I look at the migration, I looked at the line, I said it actually on your show recently, where are the women?
0.0	0.159412051989	You've got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.131038956986	When you head back to airport tonight, go check and see what the...
0.0	0.185250660212	If you're a Washington lobbyist, if you make your money in and around Washington, things are doing great.
0.0	0.125236145051	And, you know, for six-and-a-half years, we've had a gigantic party.
0.0	0.359832772996	And multiple reputable journals, including The Wall Street Journal, said ours is the best.
0.0	0.389537369092	I'm worried about bankrupting the American people.
0.0	0.436281140855	Fred Thompson was the other one, a man who had spent a lot of time on that screen.
0.0	0.210048441267	You know, frankly, I did it in Washington, in Ohio, and I will do it again in Washington, if I'm president, to get this country moving again.
0.0	0.191842695144	We are mixing apples and oranges.
0.0	0.918396589649	But then his poll numbers tanked.
0.0	0.949999196421	Marco's top tax rate is 35 percent.
0.0	0.232913629871	This nation has been great to me, and that's the only way I know to pay you back.
0.0	0.17306563524	And I would not stand for that as president of the United States.
0.0	0.213471234679	They are trying to attack us here in America.
0.0	0.51180152544	Three pages is about the maximum that a single business owner or a farmer or just a couple can understand without hiring somebody.
1.0	0.99999592222	Let's not have the most expensive business tax rate in the world.
0.0	0.662696188046	You're looking at the -- at the man who introduced and fought on the floor as a freshman senator and passed the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 over two President Clinton vetoes.
0.0	0.311366924771	And that's what we have to contrast.
0.0	0.0934639939021	You've got to give people hope.
0.0	0.300350243415	Now, let me ask you a question everybody, and, this is for the guy, you know, who owns a landscaping business out there.
0.0	0.34604156449	We're not -- the American people -- forget about anything else, they've already been lied to and stolen from.
0.0	0.420540135155	If you looking at what happened with Boeing and if you look at what happened with so many companies that deal -- so we don't have an equal playing field.
0.0	0.401251839114	Yes, we've lied to the American people about Social Security, and Medicare.
0.0	0.299825040541	He's missing the whole point, that America's leadership in the world is required for peace and stability.
0.0	0.153470886768	I think America can only live up to its potential when we make sure that every American has a chance to live up to his or her potential.
0.0	0.214610827511	But I think it is really unfair to suggest that I have not been supportive of the president.
0.0	0.0223901772779	You know that.
1.0	0.350205079865	You know, the FBI director, the president's appointed FBI director has said this week that because of a lack of support from politicians like the president of the United States, that police officers are afraid to get out of their cars; that they're afraid to enforce the law.
0.0	0.424516518882	This country is changing.
0.0	0.174367928916	And we will be strong again.
0.0	0.468039554744	If it's Medicare for all, then you no longer have the Affordable Care Act, because the Affordable Care Act, as you know very well, is based on the insurance system, based on exchanges, based on a subsidy system.
0.0	0.288995096047	It's like a tariff, but here's the difference: if we impose a tariff, China responds.
0.0	0.110383467794	You know, you look at women working.
0.0	0.271654131299	The questions that are being asked shouldn't be trying to get people to tear into each other.
0.0	0.336742684095	The fact is that there was a great effort made by the Obama administration and others to really send a clear message, because we knew that so many of these children were being abused, being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border.
0.0	0.212513686211	It works very, very well.
0.0	0.164490334574	But like all of our problems, there isn't a single one that can't be solved with common sense if you remove the ego and the politics.
0.0	0.0154294046529	See, here's the thing.
0.0	0.0455706178603	No accomplishment.
1.0	0.206336394684	They cite Obamacare.
0.0	0.52677367324	Now, who are the people who are hurt by that?
0.0	0.0410222441129	Caesar's -- excuse me -- Caesar's, the Rolls-Royce, as you know, is in bankruptcy.
0.0	0.163836664245	My dad was a bartender, my mother was a maid.
0.0	0.549991805167	Because Obama and Clinton policies, the United States is moving further and further into a decline.
0.0	0.5	And I'm going to tell you this, we need to use the benefit of our law enforcement people across this country, combined with our intelligence people across this country.
0.0	0.385252854529	I changed it in New Jersey.
1.0	0.994880391539	You used to support legalizing people that were here illegally, now you say you're against it.
1.0	0.865326669141	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.124350455262	Let em also tell you...
0.0	0.548967757235	Number one, you have people in this country that...
0.0	0.403160033751	And when FDR said, "Yeah, it is," that we're going to use all of the resources that we have to create jobs, to build homes, to feed people, to protect the farmers, we are a nation which if we come together there is nothing that we could not accomplish.
1.0	0.953633152862	It enabled him -- the president to certify them en masse without mandating meaningful background checks.
0.0	0.0411019773897	Not trustworthy.
0.0	0.128859175408	And if we try to put everybody in the same -- call everybody the same thing, we can't do it.
0.0	0.266944100141	That, I think, between the two of us demonstrates the strength of the support we have among people who want to see change in our country.
0.0	0.288248534164	Not -- not on that, no.
0.0	0.422413066452	There were four dissenters, and they said that they believe the Second Amendment protects no individual right to keep and bear arms whatsoever, which means, if their view prevailed and the next president's going to get one, two, three, maybe four Supreme Court justices, the court will rule that not a single person in this room has any right under the Second Amendment and the government could confiscate your guns.
0.0	0.296253449558	The fact of the matter is he doesn't realize that we now live in the 21st century, and that war is very different than it used to be before.
0.0	0.340929089158	He's been a good governor, and he's a heck of a lot better than his predecessor that would have bankrupted New Jersey.
0.0	0.196635295587	I choose him as my vice presidential candidate, and the Democrats sue because we can't take him along for the ride.
0.0	0.57631475901	This has gone on 50 or 60 years where the United States has been involved in overthrowing governments.
0.0	0.286165983731	Our next president, and our Republican nominee can not be someone who supports those positions.
0.0	0.369623210436	I just want to thank all my colleagues here for being civil, and not falling for the traps.

0.0	0.182770952588	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.394130285265	And second, the First Amendment Defense Act, which is protecting religious liberty, if it's not passed by then, which I suspect it won't, because the president will veto it, I will institute an executive order to make sure that people of faith are not being -- not being harassed and persecuted by the federal government for standing up for the religious beliefs.

0.0	0.55109589085	Former elected prosecutor, attorney general, governor, I was elected to all of those offices.
0.0	0.0737368436135	I think that is the real key here.
0.0	0.212166606391	So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States.
1.0	0.999999336425	And what that's led to over $2 trillion of American companies' monies that are being kept offshore, because they don't want to pay the second tax.

0.0	0.257531616578	No, I didn't care (inaudible).

0.0	0.371262551913	Why does the pharmaceutical industry make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.327907107287	And this summer, we didn't do that.
0.0	0.0417759535578	But here's the point I want to make tonight.
0.0	0.231030287721	I believe that it's most important that we unleash the full potential of women and girls in our society.
0.0	0.0905483978976	I understand we can disagree on the path forward.
0.0	0.0332280484663	So here's this -- the situation, I think, Maria.
0.0	0.432150012869	We're nowhere close to a balanced budget or fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.349804576366	They have a sophisticated understanding of our legal immigration system and we now have an obligation to ensure that they are not able to use that system against us.
0.0	0.280452768082	And you talk so much that nobody can ever keep up with what you're saying is accurate or not.
0.0	0.054450574022	As an outsider, I tackled H.P.
0.0	0.455735535223	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...

0.0	0.0912680514705	You want to talk about moral authority.
0.0	0.364052077598	If we -- if we don't act now, we are going to be the first generation in American history that leaves our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.398486902606	If a person lives in a seven room house, does the government get to say you don't need seven rooms, we're going to take two of them away?
0.0	0.618537202916	It was a company that had grown into a bloated, inept bureaucracy that cost too much and delivered too little to customers and shareholders.
0.0	0.820946997326	His plan is a good plan, and I will note that my 10% plan also eliminates the payroll tax, eliminates the death tax,
0.0	0.216719342142	They don't believe in building walls and a pessimistic view of the future.
0.0	0.405288427301	If I'm president of the United States and Congress tries to cut the military, I will veto that in a millisecond.
0.0	0.0427970572004	We need to know who our neighbors are.
0.0	0.381585726965	Right and left are spending us into oblivion.
0.0	0.679616370388	Since I was attacked too.
0.0	0.306181995722	And you better get rid of them because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.407123251174	That's where crime is happening in these cities where they don't enforce the immigration laws.
0.0	0.0419749680304	We have Arab allies.
0.0	0.115121548103	Now Maria, listen.
0.0	0.449580788128	Not too many years ago, Donald did a long interview with Tim Russert.
0.0	0.123705039978	You don't want to hear the answer.
0.0	0.0112899405601	Yeah.
0.0	0.371870931779	If somebody's already stolen money from you, are you going to give them more?
0.0	0.0969695204539	You can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.847274577545	I started as a secretary and became ultimately the chief executive of the largest technology company in the world, almost $90 billion in over 150 countries.
0.0	0.214947029169	The last thing we need is to throw our country into a contentious debate about health care again.
1.0	0.987616937335	Ronald Regan opposed the value tax because he said it was a way to blindfold the people, so the true cost of government was not there there for them.
0.0	0.118449846	But this is what you're seeing in the Republican debate that you didn't see in that Democrat debate.
0.0	0.182366999846	The answer is simple.
0.0	0.240365840441	And you don't go tell Muslim nations you want them to be part of a coalition when you have a leading candidate for president of the United States who insults their religion.
0.0	0.181360078651	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.868101919803	It is imposed on business and a critical piece that Marco seems to be missing is that this 16 percent business flat tax enables us to eliminate the corporate income tax.
0.0	0.241173787873	How do we utilize our intellect rather than allowing the government to use its, quote, "intellect," in order to help us to be able to live healthier and better lives?
0.0	0.31924109944	And -- and -- and the last piece of this, Maria, is this.
0.0	0.0624345582506	We're friends.
0.0	0.0581579058724	It was a hard choice.
0.0	0.207101236902	Trying to get Iran and Saudi Arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter.
0.0	0.175391601041	Let me just say this.
0.0	0.0292314555717	This is the fantasy...
0.0	0.128902577134	But let me just say that we also need down -- to tear down the cyber walls that China is erecting, that Russia is erecting.
1.0	0.81526119009	It looked like very few women.
0.0	0.0105057778969	I was not that candidate.
0.0	0.153527891955	Nevertheless, one of the things that I think people don't always understand is how accountable a CEO actually is.
0.0	0.0475613367418	And I do carry on occasion, sometimes a lot.
0.0	0.0703490198887	That is not consistent conservatism, that is political calculation.
0.0	0.216150163886	You know, after 9/11, one of the efforts that we did in New York was if you see something or hear something suspicious, report it.
0.0	0.428354242562	We elected a president that is weakening America on the global stage.
0.0	0.25448479698	The time to act is now.
0.0	0.3974688811	Atlantic City has gone bad.
0.0	0.0223901772779	But you know what?
0.0	0.732561315284	When millions of Americans rose up against Obamacare, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.514147581543	Here at home, we've got to do a better job coordinating between federal, state, and local law enforcement.
0.0	0.51853393562	(BELL RINGS) ... and there's a reason, when Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer came after our right to keep and bear arms, that I led the opposition, along with millions of Americans -- we defeated that gun control legislation.
0.0	0.427556052635	The law itself requires a background check, but that didn't fulfill their part of the bargain within the time that they were supposed to do.
0.0	0.142474058157	And the reason -- and the reason...
0.0	0.443788574817	And make sure you enhance savings in the private market.
0.0	0.364779963286	Let's quit blaming the people on Social Security.
0.0	0.203662864385	Everybody on this stage is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.198670841707	And I said, "well, if he wanted to play a song, maybe he could play, 'New York, New York'?"
0.0	0.285076608239	Stimulating the economy -- because it's tethered down right now with so many regulations...
0.0	0.505752592477	In that State of the Union, President Obama didn't so much as mention the 10 sailors that had been captured by Iran.
0.0	0.527928478284	And now they see Hillary Clinton proposing a third term of economic policy for our country.
0.0	0.149568980113	Well, let me -- let me first of all talk a little bit about my experience.
0.0	0.147615633859	There was nothing to this birther issue.
0.0	0.32959506303	In all due respect, Secretary Clinton, a lot of the progressive groups, the online groups have really asked you a simple question.
0.0	0.22682830168	It's not responsible.
0.0	0.0274276248623	We had Hezbollah.
0.0	0.305432016965	With grandiose language, the president talks about red lines and nothing to follow it up; talks about ISIS being the JV team, they form a caliphate the size of Indiana with 35 (thousand) to 40,000 battle-tested terrorists.
0.0	0.638067867644	I am very proud, if my memory is not correct -- I think I am -- that I have a lifetime -- and I've been in Congress a few years -- a lifetime 100 percent pro-choice voting record.
0.0	0.292885946747	And we are going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fall.
0.0	0.548080905501	We took a loan against our assets to invest it in that campaign to defend ourselves against those attacks.
0.0	0.421762818549	And Turkey, by the way, did a very decent thing, providing what was reasonable housing and conditions for those people.
