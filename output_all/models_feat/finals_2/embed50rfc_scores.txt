0.0	0.520236220921	Yes, the wealthiest people, the top 1.5 percent, will pay more in taxes.
0.0	0.366509446275	So what we're going to have to start doing instead of, you know, picking on this group or this group, is we're going to have to have a major reduction in the regulatory influence that is going on.
0.0	0.376934967166	We need to rebuild our military, and this president has let it diminish to a point where tinpot dictators like the mullahs in Iran are taking our Navy ships.

0.0	0.122549810362	Because -- because Donald's mother was born in Scotland.
0.0	0.239928993387	But let me say one more thing.

0.0	0.270303572338	You know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money.
0.0	0.341969552646	And if you really want to believe that you can get your voice back, I will tell you, as I have all my career, I will continue to fight for you, because you're the ones that built this country, and will carry it into the future.

0.0	0.449073548241	Because so many people in my family worked in steel mills, and they didn't work with a white collar, they worked in a blue collar.
0.0	0.283915873176	And we need to do that throughout the country.
0.0	0.0557706252819	But I know who the pessimist is.
0.0	0.274377046287	... they don't like the Wall Street Journal.

0.0	0.106561017898	Big difference.
0.0	0.561064960187	And it's why I've continued to focus on the fact that we need to declare war on the four big cost drivers because 80 percent of all medical costs in this country are chronic disease.
0.0	0.347565657494	We need to make sure that people understand, as Jeb said before, that if you've done extraordinarily well in this country, do you want them to take more out of your taxes now and think they're gonna give it back to you later?
0.0	0.751813079593	...
0.0	0.200636580365	But also, I can't fake anger.
0.0	0.369296183195	Here's what I would do Neil, I would appoint an Attorney General and I would have one very brief conversation with that Attorney General.
0.0	0.359807562499	And I think the reason he did is because immigration is sort of an example of what's broken and what's wrong in Washington, D..C.
0.0	0.359076527994	We put in place mandatory work fair (ph).
0.0	0.136487292741	Too often, they give up, they negotiate with themselves.
0.0	0.20871877831	So I'm going to keep making that case.
0.0	0.27279191082	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.352574909177	You also have to prove that you're going to pay these people more than you would pay someone else, so that you're not undercutting it by bringing in cheap labor.
0.0	0.226237644598	I think there is constitutional and legal authority for the president to have done what he did.
0.0	0.252290896953	He doesn't want to get people together, the old-fashioned way, where you get Congress.
0.0	0.193580371877	I hope you will make a decision soon on this.
0.0	0.480411335625	I will do everything I can to make certain that the United States and our brave men and women in the military do not get bogged down in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.
0.0	0.487013812019	But also the biggest people (ph) -- now I've used that to my advantage as a business man, for my family, for myself.
0.0	0.0182249390727	It's a joke.
0.0	0.205225242855	We also need a nominee, a candidate who will endorse our own principles.
0.0	0.751813079593	And...

0.0	0.184486617744	And I was proud to stand with him and support it.
0.0	0.179361297271	Are you fed up with how Washington wastes your money?
0.0	0.407104891122	There's a reason Gun Owners of America has endorsed me in this race.

0.0	0.156359551407	A rich person does not.
0.0	0.311913561197	And, where we are failing abysmally is in the very high rate of recidivism we see.

0.0	0.205737657958	... the fact is, Neil, let's think about -- let's think about -- and I want to maybe -- I hope the president is watching tonight, because here's what I'd like to tell him.
0.0	0.45448527938	It's a 20 percent flat rate tax, it'll take a blowtorch to the -- to the IRS.
0.0	0.416524855935	We need to lead a force, a Sunni led force inside of Syria.
0.0	0.351749733247	And listen, there is a real difference between Marco's tax plan and mine.
0.0	0.32831064671	I was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came.
0.0	0.483525895077	In my administration, we will help to make sure we bring people together in the Middle East, and we will fight ISIS and defeat them.
0.0	0.415186887346	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.119939699743	I want to be in -- I want America to be the best...
0.0	0.41803258585	We hear all this discussion about well, I would do this, or I would do that, when the fact is, the border is still porous.
0.0	0.399591129822	But the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with Iran, maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world, yes, that is something I want to achieve.
0.0	0.061658811062	And you know what?
0.0	0.365919935431	I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would.
1.0	0.991375001603	Very few children.

0.0	0.176239769411	It's kind of basic.
1.0	0.508826816818	We're sitting up here talking about all these other things; 71 percent of federal spending today is on entitlements, and debt service.
0.0	0.0427033095039	This is not entitlement, it's not welfare.
0.0	0.0634737496847	I used the tithing analogy.

0.0	0.33496364383	Every election we talk about Medicare and Social Security reform.
0.0	0.233201713384	... so you don't actually want to hear the answer, John?
0.0	0.484529140812	And you combine that with a plan to make manufacturing -- this country number one in manufacturing, you've got someone who's going to help revitalize and give hope to America, the place -- the place is that is the most hopeless today.
0.0	0.247742212698	But on this point, if I may add something on this point.
0.0	0.145346245219	You can't just ban all Muslims.
0.0	0.367115873663	You know, that's what the PC culture is all about, and it's destroying this nation.
0.0	0.0434734588552	You're welcome.
0.0	0.530359923428	Two of them were among the most highly decorated -- they weren't allowed on a military base to have guns.
0.0	0.234281860802	That is total propaganda, and this is what happens in our society.
0.0	0.185993191429	You're going away for a long, long while.
0.0	0.278078545672	I have a slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially.
0.0	0.358517828446	All over this country we have Republican candidates for president saying we hate the government.
0.0	0.469018746967	And that's why I've come forward with, for example, a plan to revitalize coal country, the coalfield communities that have been so hard hit by the changing economy, by the reduction in the use of coal.
0.0	0.327913710033	And it's a tax you find in many companies in Europe.
0.0	0.161643202847	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.319724680911	It's a private-sector solution that believes in freedom, not Obamacare that believes in government control.
0.0	0.208525426534	We actually did it.
0.0	0.157414004288	It isn't law-abiding gun owners.
0.0	0.103854101969	Well, I would really appreciate that.
0.0	0.0063827141507	This is the fantasy...
0.0	0.364073823498	And in fact, in Obama administration, we did not meet with anybody without conditions.
0.0	0.108355451287	Neil, the problem...
0.0	0.334551047956	And -- you know, all of this too big to fail stuff and picking and choosing winners and losers -- this is a bunch of crap, and it is really causing a great deal of -- great deal of problems for our society right now.
0.0	0.168153566583	People aren't dumb.
0.0	0.0831928711622	Good at email.
0.0	0.0591360825985	Illegal.
0.0	0.330034385878	And that's what I'll offer to the people of the United States in this candidacy for the presidency.
0.0	0.309037929641	And what I have said is I will not throw us further into debt.
0.0	0.186781792214	So what if mass unemployment exists?
0.0	0.24351203282	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.271057909811	Their kids are having a hard time finding any work at all.
0.0	0.204798094826	So we have to go after this both abroad and at home.
0.0	0.217234610876	And believe me, Assad is not worth it.
0.0	0.115604953678	I agree with my colleagues.
0.0	0.315697139544	Look, it takes three things basically to grow jobs.
1.0	0.983610747894	I would note that Art Laffer, Ronald Reagan's chief economic adviser, has written publicly, that my simple flat tax is the best tax plan of any of the individuals on this stage cause it produces economic growth, it raises wages and it helps everyone from the very poorest to the very richest.
0.0	0.435345196318	Well, first of all, if a company gets caught doing that, they should never be able to use the program again.
0.0	0.132939415901	It is a false choice.
0.0	0.105409113326	I said no.
0.0	0.0781221622661	I am passionate about what I believe.
0.0	0.225203322381	Get over that one, OK?
0.0	0.462586307033	You think about the regulatory cost and the tax cost -- that's why small businesses are closing, rather than being formed in our country right now.
0.0	0.308477973682	My 750,000 donors have contributed more than a million and a half donations.
0.0	0.185375904091	Today, I'm 60, I'm not married, I don't have any kids.
0.0	0.0619083787639	That's how you go from secretary to CEO.
0.0	0.264122721854	You know, I think most people know exactly what New York values are.
0.0	0.442312816801	There are a lot of people living paycheck to paycheck in Florida as well, they're looking for a senator that will fight for them each and every day.
0.0	0.0775208630007	...income tax...
0.0	0.226596322038	I think he has addressed a lot of these issues that have been quite difficult, but he has gone forward.
0.0	0.456796423961	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.152588085598	And I will tell you something that really galls me.
0.0	0.354138108167	I choose him as my vice presidential candidate, and the Democrats sue because we can't take him along for the ride.
0.0	0.349878372294	It is why we have to reduce the size and power of government.
0.0	0.272355609038	Nobody -- I could stand up here all night.
0.0	0.137942318617	And when they let me down, if they let me down, I never forgive.
0.0	0.345917957681	I think our country is tired of the politicians who simply read the polls and fail to lead.
0.0	0.274093769612	Turns out that the African-American community and the Latino community were hit especially hard.
0.0	0.419154371841	There are other attorneys that feel, and very, very fine constitutional attorneys, that feel that because he was not born on the land, he cannot run for office.
0.0	0.303843681026	And if you become the nominee, who the hell knows if you can even serve in office?
0.0	0.203968998737	But guess who pushed for that regulation?
0.0	0.19901201315	I think that is the real key here.
0.0	0.275759974881	But we're running for the presidency of the United States here.
0.0	0.541740014936	And if I am elected president, to every soldier and sailor and airman and marine, and to every police officer and firefighter and first responder who risk their lives to keep us safe, I will have your back.
0.0	0.0790767507974	That could be the great Trojan Horse.
0.0	0.751813079593	No.
0.0	0.523195480144	So, let's not in anyway imply here that either President Obama or myself, would in anyway not take on any vested interested, whether it's Wall Street, or drug companies, or insurance companies, or frankly, the gun lobby to stand up to do what's best for the American people.
0.0	0.369308043446	First of all, Ohio does have an energy industry, but we're diversified.
0.0	0.0734890793148	Credibility counts.
0.0	0.48492375515	Drugs is one of the greatest scourge in this country, and I spent five years of my administration working with my team to do a whole sort of things to try to reign in the problem of overdoses, and it goes on and on.
0.0	0.309965521483	Now, what I think is that right now we have got to do our best in developing positive relations with Russia.
0.0	0.0905683619962	We're running.
0.0	0.185676407018	Let the states do this.
0.0	0.339443271574	It is a constitutional right of every American to be able to protect themselves and their families.
0.0	0.248786997416	And at that point, it's a life that we have the right to protect, and I think we should protect.
0.0	0.5	Yes, does Wall Street and big financial interests, along with drug companies, insurance companies, big oil, all of it, have too much influence?
0.0	0.0260332429955	HEMMER: Wow.
0.0	0.0419253207404	You bet they do.
0.0	0.027217907281	OK?
0.0	0.353684128674	But I think I'll go back to building buildings if it doesn't work out.
0.0	0.305372584528	I congratulate Secretary of State John Kerry and the president for working on this agreement.
0.0	0.0372073214493	No, it should be repealed.
0.0	0.629039095333	Our wages are growing faster than the national average, and I've cut taxes more than any sitting governor in this state -- $5 billion, including no taxes on small business and killing the death tax.
0.0	0.154252735354	The fact is, there is a big overhang.
0.0	0.0105367617641	...No, sir...
0.0	0.493204804567	13 Hours -- tomorrow morning, a new movie will debut about the incredible bravery of the men fighting for their lives in Benghazi and the politicians that abandoned them.
0.0	0.127570703743	Well, I've been --
0.0	0.320135991541	They understand the vulnerabilities we have on the southern border.
0.0	0.143978755848	It's not that complicated actually.
0.0	0.203900141933	We sent our parks and wildlife wardens.
0.0	0.432550927921	Barack Obama got his massive tax increase, and there was no spending cuts.
0.0	0.45670374153	So many companies are going to leave our country.
1.0	0.98859061153	And this is not the first time that he has criticized President Obama.
0.0	0.232640577585	And I used it to pay off my loans.
0.0	0.133850950639	But she did say there was anger.
0.0	0.480317604341	According to the FBI and the director of national intelligence, Syria's becoming a perfect platform to strike our nation.
0.0	0.372433576071	And until we deal with the health of Americans and do what we did with polio -- when I was a little kid, we eradicated it.
0.0	0.144455318906	Listen, I want to just comment.
0.0	0.168114260161	You know, you look at what's going on, you see all the divisiveness and the hatred that goes on in our society.
0.0	0.323083509869	The issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24 months ago.
0.0	0.204852055554	You get the Congress, you get the Senate, you get together, you do legislation.
0.0	0.537968108585	This is one of the areas I've disagreed with Senator Sanders on, who has called for Iranian troops trying to end civil war in Syria, which I think would be a grave mistake.
0.0	0.201342150864	If a soldier has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.161643202847	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.238907139163	We have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone.
0.0	0.492551959459	She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video.
0.0	0.35248497777	Not just the hacking of OPM, but that is -- that is just shameful.
0.0	0.338626043128	If these are the kinds of people -- we should use our best and our finest.
0.0	0.0362601802505	Divisive and with no vision.
0.0	0.421196209851	I didn't get a phone call from Bill Clinton before I jumped in the race.
0.0	0.479504451671	That is like shouting "fire" in a crowded theater, and that is illegal, and I would do everything in our power not just to go after those who are here who we know who are here, before they can radicalize other Americans to carry out attacks, and it's not just the ones they've arrested.
0.0	0.443143976054	I do not believe that we need to wholesale destroy every American citizen's privacy in order to go after those that we know are suspect or are -- are already a problem.
0.0	0.346268166498	This nation has been great to me, and that's the only way I know to pay you back.
0.0	0.248637484579	At least he's honest enough to call himself a socialist.
0.0	0.578507529903	I believe that when real unemployment is close to 10%, and when our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, Flint, Michigan comes to mind.
0.0	0.464306028311	We need to make the government run smarter and better, and reform this corporate tax system, bring that money back to the United States to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, and we need to use it also to protect our grid from terrorists.
0.0	0.0420292792449	We have to obey the laws.
0.0	0.00749297615476	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.371492232792	Everytime they got a paycheck, the government reached in and took something out of it before they ever saw it.
0.0	0.350602258851	Roads, bridges, water systems, wastewater plants, who denies that?
0.0	0.413851841827	And when you do that, when you're in a position of managing regulations; when you reduce taxes; and when you have fiscal discipline, you see the job creators begin to get very comfortable with the fact that they can invest.
0.0	0.433547756817	I would sign an executive order protecting religious liberty, our first amendment rights, so Christian business owners and individuals don't face discrimination for having a traditional view of marriage.
0.0	0.208452078871	Well, obviously, you don't understand my views on homosexuality.
0.0	0.0313556044327	A Republican Congress did that.
0.0	0.416388461415	There is a war against ISIS, not just against ISIS but against radical jihadists terrorists, and it is a war that they win or we win.
0.0	0.351341882183	It comes from the right, from the left, from people on all sides of the political spectrum.
0.0	0.291852474827	... the American middle class, and who are being attacked by ideologues, by demagogues.
0.0	0.0138147864954	This is extraordinary.
0.0	0.109433178978	You had only 21 Republican governors in this country.
0.0	0.370204926661	And recognizing that it's so important, this election, because we're talking about America for the people versus America for the government.
0.0	0.480432439777	After that you pay 10 percent as a flat tax going up.
0.0	0.282293067841	But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work.
0.0	0.269569603372	Because of all the federal mandates and federal laws, it was too expensive.
0.0	0.426593985649	Now you are a worker, white worker, black worker, who had a decent job, that manufacturing job is gone.
1.0	0.968535438286	Secondly, I never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.0806157306975	It's not working.
0.0	0.240990985072	I guess just for the fun of it; they want to throw money around.
0.0	0.419014975832	We know (ph) to go ahead and shut off the supply routes, and send in our special ops at 2:00 a.m. and attack them everywhere they go.
0.0	0.00280881569458	Thank you.
0.0	0.47781454525	We have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9/11, and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks, yet we see the terrible attack in San Bernardino and know that we haven't done enough.
0.0	0.421643713667	If i were the president of the United States, I would go and look at every executive order that exists right now and determine which ones want to be voided, because the president shouldn't be legislating: not through that vehicle or any other.
0.0	0.00280881569458	Thank you.
0.0	0.463423868454	He pays on his personal rate, and he is paying higher than the big dry-cleaning chain down the street, because he's paying at his personal rate.
0.0	0.24801680732	It's fine if they come in, but they have to come in legally.
0.0	0.751813079593	No.
0.0	0.445561499875	So I'm asking women, I'm asking men, to support me because I'm ready to go into the White House on January 20th, 2017 and get to work on both domestic and foreign policy challenges.
0.0	0.0421389143441	I'm too trusting.
0.0	0.347326926154	We've got a president who cannot bring himself to say the words "radical Islamic terrorism."
0.0	0.423851956106	Now it is their time to help the middle class.
0.0	0.0418575208422	That's how you solve the problem.
0.0	0.0487376080745	And that is wrong.
0.0	0.134959263441	Those aren't Iowa values, but this is what we believe in New York."
0.0	0.479493621439	You know, coal miners and their families who helped turn on the lights and power our factories for generations are now wondering, has our country forgotten us?
0.0	0.336861143268	And right now, I will be putting up a tremendous -- so far, I've put up less than anybody and I have the best results.
0.0	0.751813079593	...
0.0	0.360702579423	Karen and I have seven children.
0.0	0.519355088857	To the 1 percent who have been fighting this war for over a decade, I'd try my best to be a commander-in-chief worthy of your sacrifice.
0.0	0.375190383529	Last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee.
0.0	0.377714439978	Corporate inversion is one of the biggest problems we have.
0.0	0.551987574249	And I give you my word, if I am elected president, no service man or service woman will be forced to be on their knees, and any nation that captures our fighting men will feel the full force and fury of the United States of America.
0.0	0.0705621620473	I looked at the intelligence.
0.0	0.3784664264	And sending that signal makes it impossible for us to be serious about taking out ISIS and restoring democracy in Syria.
0.0	0.266432511102	It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are.
1.0	0.990199857204	When we have more people in jail, disproportionately African American and Latino, than China does, a communist authoritarian society four times our size.
0.0	0.360324670251	And I think once I'm in the White House we will have enough political capital to be able to do that.
0.0	0.483336095759	To use the Justice Department, as we just saw, they have said they are going to sue Ferguson, that entered into a consent agreement, and then tried to back out.
0.0	0.48501918066	So what we have tried to do and what President Obama succeeded in doing was to build on the health care system we have, get us to 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.283544755215	No, not a comic book, and it's not a very nicely asked question the way you say that.
0.0	0.00280881569458	Thank you.
0.0	0.22214002681	If you want someone to grab a beer with, I may not be that guy.
1.0	0.992454185101	And again, paid for.
0.0	0.380367122058	The president has done an executive order with respect to illegal immigration that is illegal.
0.0	0.28732540619	You see, because if you really want to get to a balanced budget, you need to reduce your expenses and you need to grow your economy.
0.0	0.0865056507782	I'm tested.
0.0	0.079505250698	We need to reverse that.
0.0	0.422021905531	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.257152566236	You know why three?
0.0	0.398039184839	But you know what, you can make a middle class wage, you have decent health care, decent benefits.
0.0	0.157757153266	And that's what this economy needs to -- that's what this debate needs to be about.
0.0	0.15032268603	Our rights come from God.
0.0	0.363407011428	They are more likely to know what's happening in their families and their communities, and they need to feel not just invited, but welcomed within the American society.
0.0	0.194846209004	I'm just saying.
0.0	0.161513887942	Let's talk about our campaigns.
0.0	0.0173099912411	There's -- look, there's --
0.0	0.439047846116	I am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of Vermont from very significant majorities of women.
0.0	0.201009650617	I'll suggest a part of that was his celebrity.
0.0	0.232221001419	That never works.
0.0	0.128473293287	It's not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.262469743192	That's wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country.
0.0	0.148273923939	China doesn't pay the tariff, the buyer pays the tariff.
0.0	0.219153827146	On the issue of Barack Obama, Barack Obama does not believe that America is a great global power.
0.0	0.487842851552	That is a dramatic tax decrease for hard-working people who run their own businesses.
0.0	0.234453552169	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.30643914522	We can make a stronger program.
0.0	0.107888846166	That will be my mission as president.
0.0	0.0766605746287	Do we still have values and principles?
0.0	0.334640799745	It has to be based on what skills you have, what you can contribute economically, and most important of all, on whether or not you're coming here to become an American, not just live in America, but be an American.
0.0	0.222208791519	I would a whole lot rather had Carly Fiorina over there doing our negotiation than John Kerry.
0.0	0.226916299146	And, they're always going to say, "Well, we're going to fix this one day."
0.0	0.0339796688617	We had Hamas.
0.0	0.270620892596	Chris Christie wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.297113153556	We will arm and train the Kurds.
0.0	0.308878002324	Since I was attacked too.

0.0	0.448289809121	He's got probably a four or five percent chance.
0.0	0.14315229046	Gosh, I'd love for us to talk about something like that.
0.0	0.196002793161	And I won't be angry when we fix it, but until we fix it, I'm very, very angry.
0.0	0.239214959916	I never said that.
0.0	0.285358590247	Well, that has not been a part of most of the proposals that I've seen.

0.0	0.520134709869	But I knew that good people who wanted to be a part of the American dream have become trapped in dependency because the federal government and the state government had made it in their economic interest not to take a job because the benefits that they didn't work were better.
0.0	0.124638289358	I'm president -- look, I've done it once.
0.0	0.0828579897257	...numerically, it's gonna be higher.

1.0	0.974932138216	You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don't agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements.
0.0	0.430440020564	This is a group of people that burns people in cages, that is conducting genocide against Christians and Yazidis and others in the region.
0.0	0.430337256352	If you send a tie or a shirt made in China into the United States and an American goes to buy it at the store and there's a tariff on it, it gets passed on in the price to price to the consumer.
0.0	0.20215684321	We don't need newer (ph) laws.

0.0	0.53337240037	And so much of what we did -- to force competition, to use technology, to stand down the special interest groups -- can you imagine taking Medicaid from 10 to 2.5 percent?
1.0	0.57000463253	It says that after 35 million people have come here over the last 20 years, almost all of whom are unskilled workers, flattening wages, creating horrible opportunity -- a lack of opportunities for unskilled workers, we're going to do something about reducing the level of immigration by 25 percent.

1.0	0.97645777164	Well, Marco has been floating this attack for a few weeks now, but the problem is, the business flat tax in my proposal is not a vat.
0.0	0.428114463413	I have been a strong ally with him on virtually every issue.
0.0	0.203674133255	But in 2008, we elected a president that didn't want to fix America.
0.0	0.459902198598	The fact is that there was a great effort made by the Obama administration and others to really send a clear message, because we knew that so many of these children were being abused, being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border.
0.0	0.451931967662	But the issue for us is to have a Congress that stands up and says not only no, but "Hell no" to this money going to a regime that is going to use it for terror, Susan Rice has said that, and we need to stand up and strongly and clearly tell the ayatollah that -- whoever the next president of the United States is going to be, and I'll promise you, if it's me, the first thing that I will do is tear up that agreement with Iran.
0.0	0.330907225841	So, we're going to enforce the law, we're going to change policing practices, we're going to change incarceration practices, but we're also going to emphasize education, jobs, and housing.
0.0	0.29711215836	So, let's stop fooling around about this, let's tell people the truth.
0.0	0.0432547779191	And Mr. Trump is very focused...
0.0	0.0865750856002	But here's the best solution of all.

0.0	0.284728808866	And I have to tell you, that was a very insulting statement that Ted made.
0.0	0.339585798653	At the core of that resolution is an agreement I negotiated in June of 2012 in Geneva, which set forth a cease-fire and moving toward a political resolution, trying to bring the parties at stake in Syria together.
0.0	0.476974265894	Folks, the government has no business stealing even more from the people who have paid this in.
0.0	0.459488209348	And nobody watching at home believed that any of the moderators had any intention of voting in a Republican primary.

0.0	0.12678464931	Came out great.
0.0	0.284591453348	I sell tens' of millions of (inaudible).
0.0	0.197730801034	Well, let me tell you this.
0.0	0.391673872332	And, let me now on Social Security because we were getting into a good substantive exchange, and I want to say I think both Chris, and Mike are right.
0.0	0.589887520916	I built a net worth of way over $10 billion, and I have done it four times out of hundreds.
0.0	0.127897811731	Well, sure.
0.0	0.061658811062	I know how to do that.
0.0	0.0819876104673	Right.
0.0	0.24950986657	Well, this is what I would say.
0.0	0.3084757052	Now, on that tariff -- here's what I'm saying, China -- they send their goods and we don't tax it -- they do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.377901611614	You've seen middle-class wages go backwards $3,700 during the Obama administration.
0.0	0.382310493749	And it is a -- the kind of criticism that we've heard from Senator Sanders about our president I expect from Republicans.
0.0	0.336291919083	I'm not -- my campaign is going to be about the future of America, it's not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage.
0.0	0.27222392968	We have a huge mental health problem in this country.
0.0	0.510100901298	Not armies massively marching on each other and air forces, but now we have dirty bombs and we have cyber attacks and we have people who will be attacking our electrical grid.
0.0	0.0698449199676	You're right.

0.0	0.00414468352848	...Chris...
0.0	0.356779899573	But I would probably have my children run it with my executives and I wouldn't ever be involved because I wouldn't care about anything but our country, anything.
0.0	0.220372623731	Well, Neil, I'm glad we're focusing on the important topics of the evening.
0.0	0.393631606979	And as someone who's worn the uniform of the country, that's how we build our military back up.
0.0	0.151755234237	This is a great nation.
0.0	0.439752648676	And it costs, with dynamic scoring, less than a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.479611371237	But in the interim, in the absence of that, what's happening is some of these tech companies are taking those -- those centers (ph) to Canada because they can get people to go over there instead of here.
0.0	0.215016014527	We have to work with NATO to protect Eastern Europe against any kind of Russian aggression.
0.0	0.413506658241	I want to go back for a second thought on this issue of income inequality.

0.0	0.0057865829172	Maria...
0.0	0.270832538473	We're going to be actually out there trying to create a better life for hard-working Americans.
0.0	0.204223676669	So when somebody like Donald Trump and others...
0.0	0.40502447383	Health savings accounts are something that we introduced.

0.0	0.245530210375	Crony capitalism is alive and well, and has been so in Washington, D.C. for decades.
0.0	0.2207462269	Now that he is, he's changed his tune.
0.0	0.18726014436	You've got to keep asking.
0.0	0.262703121825	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.454092974339	What this campaign is about is creating a process for a political revolution in which millions of Americans, working people who have given up on the political process, they don't think anybody hears their pains or their concerns.
0.0	0.14469769323	No, I didn't care (inaudible).
0.0	0.291115599222	I want a government so small I can barely see it.

0.0	0.289604121073	How about talking about the substantive issues the people care about?
0.0	0.48332102358	It was the first time we did it since man walked on the moon.
1.0	0.965413377108	The blurb said that the next president of the United States has got to be aggressive in bringing people into the political process.
0.0	0.522899413794	We're going to combine all commercial activity in business into one place in the tax code and charge it 15 percent, which is going to suddenly make us competitive with the rest of the world.
0.0	0.461802155435	We don't need Hillary Clinton's price controls for -- again, does anybody out there think that giving Washington, D.C., the opportunity to run the pharmaceutical industry is a good idea, given how well they have done running the government?
0.0	0.478232708529	A law has been sitting -- languishing, sadly, on Capitol Hill and has not yet been passed, and it would help.
0.0	0.101158612166	Hillary Clinton cannot be president.
0.0	0.108574540631	And I would not support those.
0.0	0.41611868521	The fact that it's happened for so many people here throughout our history, that's what makes us special.
0.0	0.625386505243	And, it turns out that up until -- and this has blown me away, never in a million years would I have believed that I would be standing here tonight telling you that we have received three and a half million individual contributions from well over a million people.
0.0	0.516923375569	And based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don't add up, and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now.
0.0	0.357568596384	If she gets elected, she's under investigation with the FBI right now.
0.0	0.21152473103	Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point?
0.0	0.457320941278	I have the experience as a prosecutor, attorney general, governor, United States Army intelligence veteran, governor during the 9/11 attack, chairman of the Terrorism Commission for this country.
0.0	0.132331150734	And I'm not blaming these folks -- but I guess I could.
0.0	0.260507093624	Those of you health savings accounts.
0.0	0.528732191818	It would bring the money back into the United States to help build jobs by American companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about.
0.0	0.539932360544	And therefore, they don't get the income tax break, but their prices are going to be higher, because the vat tax is embedded in both the prices that business that are charging and in the wages they pay their employees.
0.0	0.380093207142	It turns out some dot wasn't connected, and so the first thing we have to do is make sure that everyone and every responsible agency is attuned to all of these possibilities and symptoms.
0.0	0.0656870670011	When I was 22, my dad died.
0.0	0.191754358638	Now, you've got Europe.

0.0	0.430626675866	But I think there has to be recognition that if we -- if we are too punitive, then you'll go to other -- other technology companies outside the United States.
0.0	0.339440206858	We put in place child care support.
0.0	0.330511695528	There's only a promise to pay by the next generation, and the next generation's not big enough to pay it.
0.0	0.342559923916	That's absurd, and I think people who don't want to fix it, really, or unwilling to take the chance to say, "something has to change," are missing the boat here.
0.0	0.319715655251	(inaudible), the great majority of Republicans and Americans believe in a hopeful future.

1.0	0.489132346441	We stuck to the fact that Americans are tired of Washington corporate interests and Democrats who are interested in just politics and power and they're looking for someone who's going to fight for them; looking for someone who's going to grow manufacturing sector of our economy, so those 74 percent of Americans who don't have a college degree have a chance to rise again.

0.0	0.336890198579	It's "give me options on how I can make it harder for law-abiding people to buy guns."
0.0	0.189712646206	I think it's a good product.

0.0	0.239404858066	You know, I know to a lot of people in the media, this is just a great big game, and we're the players.
0.0	0.505781087952	If we want to create jobs for the folks that you're talking about, who are having trouble getting off government benefits, primarily because of their low skill level, there is no better way -- it's worked for 100 years in America -- putting people back to work in manufacturing is it.
0.0	0.097741351458	The worker's out of a job.
0.0	0.109404371593	And that's why we're in the trouble that we're in now.

0.0	0.140578629975	I'm wearing a Trump tie tonight.
0.0	0.163485045165	That's gonna be the real growth engine.
0.0	0.275306542822	We should be relying upon the leadership of the Congress to pass the laws.
0.0	0.423545715039	They are radicalizing people in the United States, they are conducting attacks around the world.
0.0	0.025863163716	I promise.
0.0	0.450864524269	And -- and I would note indeed, the reason I said that is I was asked -- my friend Donald has taken to it as (ph) advance playing Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the USA", and I was asked what I thought of that.
0.0	0.341601325571	As a result of his efforts and the efforts of Joe Biden against unprecedented, I was there in the Senate, unprecedented Republican obstructionism, we have made enormous progress.
0.0	0.26858435729	And the last piece is this.
0.0	0.310396397881	In fact, if my mother were secretary of treasury, we would not be in a deficit situation.

0.0	0.135300626047	Well, I don't know.
0.0	0.5	You'll create a much better graduation rate at a lower cost, and you won't in debt the next generation with recourse debt on their backs.
0.0	0.262190919215	We've got a president who instead says, we're going to change hearts and minds.
0.0	0.00880244732487	Appreciate it.
0.0	0.428501582448	We need to get back to training people in this country to do the jobs of the 21st century.
0.0	0.47536603841	In all due respect, Secretary Clinton, a lot of the progressive groups, the online groups have really asked you a simple question.
0.0	0.427197898458	Now, I find it rather amazing, because I happen to believe that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country.
0.0	0.17183928837	But I think they will see a very good option here.
0.0	0.0826216978518	I totally get that.
0.0	0.455245067708	One of them being that if you don't have some agreement within the system from states and from families and from students, it's hard to get to where we need to go.
0.0	0.634634364413	So beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given -- bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money.
0.0	0.231974149977	That tells you right away where he was headed on all of this.
0.0	0.506447152975	And, then we have to go after sentencing, and that's one of the problems here in Wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn't happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level.
0.0	0.391956619682	If I'm president of the United States and Congress tries to cut the military, I will veto that in a millisecond.
0.0	0.142335025503	They're absolutely false.
0.0	0.350067910062	We can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports gun control.

0.0	0.0226348385014	Edward Snowden is a traitor.
0.0	0.38901017626	You can't send your troops into harm's way unless you give them every opportunity to be successful.
0.0	0.33516630059	I'm not talking about now, I'm talking about in the future they're building massive plants in China because China does not want Boeing building their planes here, they want them built in China, because China happens to be smart the way they do it, not the way we do it.
0.0	0.160149917658	Yes, I'm going to do away with that.
0.0	0.165471396014	A growth of 385,000 jobs.
0.0	0.422021905531	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.252287697374	If you're a Washington lobbyist, if you make your money in and around Washington, things are doing great.
0.0	0.155667362752	We need security.
0.0	0.402022839216	And it is now being put into place everyplace across the state of Ohio.
0.0	0.751813079593	That is...
0.0	0.239214959916	I never said that.
0.0	0.258541545836	But to destroy ISIS, it is necessary.
1.0	0.991740799846	And what that's led to over $2 trillion of American companies' monies that are being kept offshore, because they don't want to pay the second tax.
0.0	0.3368165649	I was governor on September 11th, and I'm proud of my leadership in bringing New York through that time.
0.0	0.317653575826	I will spend every ounce of energy to stop it.
0.0	0.27340334076	Crony capitalism is what happens when government gets so big and so powerful that only the big and the powerful can handle it.

0.0	0.562782837526	We'll tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money.
0.0	0.364940462731	When I am president of the United States, I'm going to side with Ronald Regan on this and not Nancy Pelosi and we are not having a vat tax.

0.0	0.061658811062	You know why?
0.0	0.176469214285	That's what I've always stood for.
0.0	0.449713144005	I was an Army intelligence agent and a veteran during the Cold War, assigned to West Germany.
0.0	0.457062996078	First, rather than expand benefits for everyone, I do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs.
0.0	0.221668329171	And there is no reason that you can't be perfectly fair to the gay community.
0.0	0.312472369538	Conservatives, I am a conservative because I believe no one of us is any better than any other one of us.
0.0	0.474617960194	One as a marine officer in Iraq, one as an army officer in Afghanistan.
0.0	0.340942511593	And the world's financial system is on the verge of collapse.
0.0	0.0810063332124	Yes.
0.0	0.0482036140252	We have to do something.
0.0	0.424891033064	The fact of the matter is he doesn't realize that we now live in the 21st century, and that war is very different than it used to be before.
0.0	0.311058957886	We're going to bring jobs and manufacturing back.
0.0	0.276088651998	We're going to have too many people in the cart rather than pulling the cart.
0.0	0.386365172774	And I just want to say, you know, last week we released our tax plan.
0.0	0.00280881569458	Thank you.
1.0	0.559639887723	Six million more people living in poverty than the day that Barack Obama got elected president, and the left just wants more of the same.
0.0	0.451299998664	... in addition to that, we go ahead and we take the oil from them, their source of revenue.
0.0	0.452970965848	A healthy environment, a strong economy and energy independent America -- that would be the purpose of my presidency, is break the strangle hold that people enjoy on fossil fuels who hate our guts.
0.0	0.337989275113	You did support a U.N. Security Council approach, which we did follow up on.
0.0	0.32349289622	Our greatest days lie ahead if we are willing to do what it takes now.
0.0	0.271684882179	And in your heart of hearts, you cannot wait to see a debate between Hillary Clinton and Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.238113873005	When we do business with China, they tax us.
0.0	0.214306769002	And I have many great Muslim friends.
0.0	0.17326199515	I mean, just think about a scenario like that.
0.0	0.3173244064	She'd be a great president of the United States because the leadership she brought to H.P.
0.0	0.355120790677	You know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in America.
0.0	0.372056268002	I was very honored to be asked to do that and very honored to serve with him those first four years.
0.0	0.191584380942	And that is what's so critical for our neighborhoods, our families, our children, and our grandchildren.
0.0	0.520118786948	You know, we could give you another example -- the Marines, the Army, these wonderful six soldiers that were killed.
0.0	0.407612321393	And just to finish, people say, how will you get Mexico to pay?
1.0	0.464158765674	In Florida, we have the lowest in-state tuition of any state, because there's accountability, just as John said.
0.0	0.0739907839927	I like that.
0.0	0.155870547138	But here's the real key.
0.0	0.355826040285	And when I'm president, we're not just going to have a president that gives a State of the Union and says America is the greatest country in the world.
0.0	0.331301978601	If they had guns, he wouldn't be around very long.
0.0	0.293157009248	We're going to suspend -- I've -- I've said this for four years.
0.0	0.318377840959	Now, let me ask you a question everybody, and, this is for the guy, you know, who owns a landscaping business out there.
0.0	0.087542178145	So I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.071214231686	We're friends.
0.0	0.377916920132	We have Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view.
0.0	0.366558186528	We even had warnings about the Boston Marathon bombers, and yet the dots weren't connected.
0.0	0.751813079593	I have.
0.0	0.5	Every one of us is gifted by God, whether it is those poor babies being picked over or it's someone whose life is tangled up in a web of dependence.
0.0	0.252067711812	Gronkowski is still going strong.
0.0	0.142410809932	Growth is the answer.
0.0	0.199496977387	And I want to make this our government.
0.0	0.212275852694	Look, the -- the deal is already done.
0.0	0.296205910047	I believe in government, but I believe in efficient government, not wasteful government.
0.0	0.00607120364176	... an agreement with the...
0.0	0.296825886037	I used the laws of the country to my benefit, I'm sorry.
0.0	0.289445117578	Well, let's go with three.
0.0	0.301716175062	Simply expanding Medicaid does not improve health care outcomes.
0.0	0.481876595368	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.268399994127	I talked about Donald Trump from the standpoint of being an individual who was using his celebrity rather than his conservatism.
0.0	0.138267410795	It goes in the right direction.
0.0	0.0866053595077	They do it to us, we don't it.
0.0	0.409447622228	The reason I did so well last time is not just because of the vision, it's because I have a track record in Washington, D.C. of getting things done.
0.0	0.356730240608	That's the side we need to be on, and that's the side of the bulk of the -- of the Middle East.
0.0	0.222800325403	You just have to look today at Indonesia, bombings all over.
0.0	0.241459040658	You also have to get rid of all the deductions and all the loopholes.
0.0	0.478374875966	President Obama's preparing to send $100 billion or more to the Ayatollah Khamenei.
0.0	0.525673450565	I'm the only person on this stage that actually was involved in the chief architect of balancing the Federal Budget.
0.0	0.342382930459	That's the establishment telling us to hide our conservative principles to get the left and the media to like us.
0.0	0.248654415597	But what he's touching -- talking about, I think has got merit.
0.0	0.00655194801992	That's a blessing.
0.0	0.390351181672	The American people have rejected your agenda and now you're trying to go around it.
0.0	0.350012086543	You know, the NASDAQ dropped 80 percent -- 80 percent -- and it took 15 years for the NASDAQ to recover.
0.0	0.394072188933	You find me a Democrat -- you find me a Democrat that will cut spending ten dollars?
0.0	0.479759148284	And now after seven years of your policies, we have the biggest majority we've had since the 1920s in the House; a Republican majority in the Senate; and 31 out of 50 Republican governors.
0.0	0.258443619936	To talk about we're just gonna have a 10 percent tithe and that's how we're gonna fund the government?
0.0	0.204859560033	What have you got now?
1.0	0.983019191264	We have the world's best military, even though he's done everything he can to diminish it.
0.0	0.188787158898	We could do a whole show on that.
0.0	0.0181018147284	SuperPacs are a disaster.
0.0	0.263457689979	The Koch Brothers have a very clear political agenda.
0.0	0.210739391189	I'm a Catholic, I believe life begins at conception.
0.0	0.3190643812	So, we are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we have to root out in our society.
0.0	0.192302719382	This is the first priority.
0.0	0.133711530893	The most mistreated people.
0.0	0.751813079593	...
0.0	0.358114169995	If you elect me president of the United States, I will secure that southern border.
1.0	0.102623265739	Believe me, that is why Ohio is doing well.
0.0	0.286475534617	That is the appropriate approach in order to get the results that you are seeking.
0.0	0.0709794680659	But I want to go further.
0.0	0.152157127391	Because now he's going a little bit better.
0.0	0.364901117605	And if you elect me president, we will bring incredible growth back to this country.
0.0	0.331881882403	And also, I've been tested in a way no one else has.
0.0	0.381075514466	If you do that, you don't just change the economy, you transform the lives of millions of hurting Americans.
0.0	0.274455678484	We don't need to raise taxes to get this done.
0.0	0.374986904037	I am convinced that this president, if he could get rid of the Second Amendment, he would.
0.0	0.143422206273	It is broke, it is not working.
0.0	0.0732770838331	You have to lead.
0.0	0.061658811062	So you know what?
0.0	0.538433401439	Until we have a president of the United States that gets up every day and goes to the Oval Office with the intent purpose of securing that border, and there's not anybody on either one of these stages that has the experience of dealing with this as I have for over 14 years with that 1200-mile border.
0.0	0.0297689858834	How great is that?
0.0	0.175542559222	-- the issue is who is going to get it done.
0.0	0.367570567606	You had two one hundred...
0.0	0.5	Well, you just -- you just listed a litany of discredited attacks from Democrats and my political opponents, and I'm not gonna waste 60 seconds detailing them all.
0.0	0.0256337257422	Alright.
0.0	0.751813079593	You did.
0.0	0.244987470915	And you shouldn't have mentioned the polls because I would have been much...
0.0	0.40107796359	We are trying to bring America together around an agenda that works for working families and the middle class.
0.0	0.349715164811	And the reason is simple: because in 2008, we elected as president someone who wasn't interested in fixing America.
0.0	0.350482500768	You don't solve it by big talk where you're banning all Muslims and making it harder for us to build the kind of coalition for us to be successful.
0.0	0.227728851183	Two quick responses.
0.0	0.118280249003	Marco Rubio, why don't you resign?
0.0	0.185965382514	And they got a killer in San Bernardino in posing as a fiance.
0.0	0.127332868687	I like Marco Rubio.
0.0	0.193439261406	We lose with ISIS.
0.0	0.104458748409	-- fix America, this is the formula.
0.0	0.354844551481	I say, yes, not only do we give them what they need, but we don't tie their hands behind their backs so that they can go ahead and get the job done.
0.0	0.0266845656092	I'm very proud.
0.0	0.392940879776	The president doesn't understand -- and by the way, neither does Secretary Clinton -- and here's my warning to everybody out in the audience tonight.
0.0	0.265386425866	But my wife is down here in the front, and I'm sure, if you'd like to talk to her later, she can give you more than you'll ever be able to take care of.
0.0	0.306126627964	Big government favors the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected, and crushes the small and the powerless.
0.0	0.0120260735335	And there should be some regulation.
0.0	0.225407617672	Maria, let me clear something up here.
0.0	0.599948801147	Last week in a CNN town hall, the Senator told a questioner that the questioner would spend about $500 dollars in taxes to get about $5,000 dollars in healthcare.
0.0	0.388242892147	Community- based businesses and farms are getting crushed.
0.0	0.5341987929	Well, first of all, we're running a $2 billion dollar surplus, we're not having a revenue problem right now.
0.0	0.469008650619	They attacked us in Philadelphia last week.
0.0	0.302266856192	I'm a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.143045728316	Do we still have standards?
0.0	0.751813079593	But...
0.0	0.266481852807	I will not shock anybody to suggest that in politics there is occasionally a little bit of hypocrisy.
1.0	0.975518835085	Mossadegh back in 1953.
0.0	0.0683956799265	...eliminates the business...
0.0	0.569251296979	Even if it was a one percent chance, and it's far greater than one percent because (inaudible).
0.0	0.175330115857	We're not going to solve this problem with traditional politics.
0.0	0.308954410782	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.207263883108	He has never defended...
0.0	0.288772193141	Nothing has to change for current beneficiaries.
0.0	0.078013126144	We have a -- they say there's no bipartisanship in Washington?
0.0	0.234499083909	You know, the Russians wanted to buy time.
0.0	0.209999970748	But we are where we are right now.
0.0	0.30675237278	I mean, you have great constitutional lawyers that say you can't run.
0.0	0.14271343306	We have to do this in unison with the Arab world.
1.0	0.975395391528	It enabled him -- the president to certify them en masse without mandating meaningful background checks.
0.0	0.0928944334242	And we need to very, very concerned about that.
0.0	0.0607944967561	We have to stand with them.
0.0	0.162583987805	Folks, we've got to wake up.
0.0	0.163253140518	I frankly don't think there will be much change because I think what's going to happen is you're going to get more of the same.
0.0	0.433188718092	And that's what you'll hear from Hillary Clinton -- and I've already heard from her -- is that, send more money in Social Security, send more money in Medicare taxes, send more money for Medicaid, and that's gonna solve the problem.
0.0	0.0344790131748	So I'm doing great.
0.0	0.443688443614	I laid out a plan at the Citadel to do just that and it starts with creating a "No Fly Zone" and "Safe Zones" to make sure refugees are there.
0.0	0.309814670819	Guaranteeing that women's work finally gets the pay, the equal pay that we deserve.
0.0	0.192689443774	And I want to just suggest to you.
0.0	0.508083288847	You think about it -- this is the president who said, along with his secretary of state -- drew a red line in Syria, said, if Assad uses chemical weapons against his people, that we're going to attack.
1.0	0.986609989416	Who denies that real unemployment today, including those who have given up looking for work and are working part-time is close to 10 percent?
0.0	0.219091361256	We should reimpose sanctions, they've already violated sanctions after this agreement was signed by testing medium-range missiles.
0.0	0.531397665236	In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense.
0.0	0.373389363178	And, that will get to the nub of opportunity for our children, and an ability to see wages rise.
0.0	0.471179208592	Those jobs, in many cases, are now gone.
0.0	0.218314005933	Well, it's an interesting question because I'm very proud of my company.
0.0	0.303454414811	For both of them you have to gradually raise the age.
0.0	0.560200900307	But when we talk about Wall Street, you have Wall Street and major banks have paid $200 billion in fines since the great crash.
0.0	0.478618350416	You just see the recent deal announced today or yesterday, more spending, more tax increasing, more regulation.
0.0	0.138360167655	It goes away.
0.0	0.43071826121	But let's be clear: Russia's aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO -- correctly, I believe -- are saying, you know what, we're going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action.
0.0	0.0220535236252	They expect to have it.
0.0	0.41402053838	We both believe there has to be more money going into the Social Security system.
0.0	0.360293630391	And Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will say it's those evil rich people.
0.0	0.360737715149	And make sure you enhance savings in the private market.
0.0	0.438279596313	We need somebody ready to be commander-in-chief on day one, who understands there are no moderates in Iran, they've been killed a long time ago.
0.0	0.13005556244	Bernie Sanders, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.
0.0	0.372758007265	I believe this is still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.316894293095	That sounds like a long time ago.
0.0	0.378843804891	Or how about Boeing right here within a mile?
0.0	0.375664540561	I've heard them talk about deporting 10 or 11 -- people here from this country out of this country, splitting families.
0.0	0.313637477337	You know, these plans would put us trillions and trillions of dollars in debt.
0.0	0.00898775255536	Creativity.
0.0	0.245875794297	... with what Marco is saying is that it takes too long, they're sucking us dry and it takes too long.
0.0	0.224817173333	So when Nikki said that, I wasn't offended.
0.0	0.235661923177	They are trying to attack us here in America.
0.0	0.323379071939	... on the issue of citizenship, Donald, I'm not going to use your mother's birth against you.
0.0	0.357022746639	And here in Wisconsin, I want to reiterate: We've got to stand up for unions and working people who have done it before...
0.0	0.301453441733	And -- and I just want to take this opportunity to say, you know, in the 2012 election, you know, we -- and when I say we, Republicans -- tore themselves apart.
1.0	0.991243394859	I vetoed a statewide I.D. system for gun owners and I pardoned, six out-of-state folks who came through our state and were arrested for owning a gun legally in another state so they never have to face charges.
0.0	0.339701362323	That sounds like people are afraid the president's going to take their guns away.
0.0	0.238783199078	... the best results, wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.251138490369	Bill, I want to say one more thing about...
0.0	0.305477741283	My parents in this country were able to give me the chance to do all the things they never did.
0.0	0.514824972368	Unfortunately, Governor Christie has endorsed many of the ideas that Barack Obama supports, whether it is Common Core or gun control or the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor or the donation he made to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.565317989459	We have arrived at a point in our nation's history where the potential of this nation and too many Americans is being crushed by the weight, the power, the cost, the complexity, the ineptitude, the corruption of the federal government, and only someone who will challenge the status quo of Washington, D.C. can lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.189647935031	I'm going to do what it takes to defend this nation.
0.0	0.289302194147	So, it's going to be my responsibility to make sure we move forward to solve these problems that are now out in the open.
0.0	0.175404785789	It turns out we knew something was wrong.
0.0	0.335384963261	And I would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country.
0.0	0.414409668265	But everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro- gay-marriage, focus around money and the media.
0.0	0.239618566252	But I -- the struggle of single moms is extraordinary.
0.0	0.402233423007	Well, listen, I've spent my entire life defending the Constitution before the U.S. Supreme Court.
0.0	0.42963521535	If you looking at what happened with Boeing and if you look at what happened with so many companies that deal -- so we don't have an equal playing field.
0.0	0.193498381625	I absolutely would call on them to collaborate and cooperate, yes.
0.0	0.288712069246	I do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination to succeed President Obama.
0.0	0.227296142524	That is not protected free speech.
0.0	0.384084574541	And listen, there are many, many wonderful, wonderful working men and women in the state of New York.
0.0	0.20776144658	What else we can do is that we should believe in science.
0.0	0.159939178679	It needs to be repealed and replaced.
0.0	0.519084561001	When he meets with the attorney general in the White House, it's not "how can we protect the Second Amendment rights of Americans."
0.0	0.135219557172	It's easier to talk to your friends.
0.0	0.392156907189	The cybersecurity challenges that we face, this administration failed us completely, completely.
0.0	0.282901247297	It is time for Republicans in D.C. to fight.

0.0	0.0239022252488	And what is that proposal?
0.0	0.167668278839	And let me be clear.

0.0	0.432544957557	We're borrowing a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.428021001514	This is about people's lives, and we should level with the American people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare.

0.0	0.310655845442	One of your colleagues interviewed me.
0.0	0.436168078975	And I was going to tell you, whether I'm president or not, we better make it clear to the Saudis that we're going to support you, we're in relation with you just like we were in the first Gulf War, but you've got to knock off the funding and teaching of radical clerics who are the very people who try to destroy us and will turn around and destroy them.
0.0	0.432700541167	Our country rise up again, but we need to have a compelling conservative agenda that we present to the American people in a way that doesn't disparage people, that unites us around our common purpose.
0.0	0.471673260835	I am very proud, if my memory is not correct -- I think I am -- that I have a lifetime -- and I've been in Congress a few years -- a lifetime 100 percent pro-choice voting record.

0.0	0.369983987209	We're going to bring jobs back from Japan, we're going to bring jobs back from China, we're going to bring, frankly, jobs back from Mexico where, as you probably saw, Nabisco is leaving Chicago with one of their biggest plants, and they're moving it to Mexico.
0.0	0.434827615575	But I do hope that in years to come, just as occurred with Cuba, 10, 20 years ago, people would say, reach normalized relations with Cuba.
0.0	0.319235146775	You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president...

0.0	0.0121345343413	No accomplishment.
0.0	0.215881340964	I propose to reverse that and get this economy moving again.
0.0	0.436447674786	-- living in extreme poverty is the highest level on record.

0.0	0.421936616362	We have to continue to work with the Iraqi army so that they are better prepared to advance on some of the other strongholds inside Iraq, like Mosul, when they are able to do so.

0.0	0.261310604146	And for the life of me, I have no understanding why the president thinks that everything is going well.
0.0	0.261942724093	Now, since September, the Constitution hasn't changed.
0.0	0.558307601409	And I would note the Senate just a few weeks ago voted to suspend refugees from Middle Eastern countries.
0.0	0.513892341515	Well, let's just -- let's just follow up on this, because, you know, I've made it very clear that no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail, and because of Dodd-Frank, we now have in law a process that the president, the Federal Reserve, and others can use if any bank poses a systemic risk.
0.0	0.295835770504	We have got to destroy their training camps and recruiting centers.

0.0	0.333380471636	John Kasich, will you insult two people over here?
0.0	0.533835330679	But if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things, including corporate taxes, and including the capital gains taxes, you make that amount up pretty quickly.

0.0	0.061658811062	And you know what?
0.0	0.200675462999	Let em also tell you...
0.0	0.327459387161	I do not see -- want to see one parent or loved one worrying about getting a call in the middle of the night.
0.0	0.462757667519	I've watched to see people say that we should dismantle Medicare and Medicaid and leave the senior citizens out -- out in the -- in the cold.
0.0	0.237648999926	The D.C. politicians continue to make things worse.
0.0	0.010239177258	I have no illusion.
0.0	0.428985170444	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.0810063332124	Yes.
0.0	0.167818047043	They're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.0610963317924	And that doesn't have to be true.
0.0	0.0114364220802	That's a dictatorship.
0.0	0.387183798866	There is no money in the Social Security account.
0.0	0.399009826343	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.0665903133022	My dad was a bartender, my mother was a maid.
0.0	0.37087587909	She wants to continue down the path of Iran, Benghazi, the Russian reset, Dodd-Frank, all the things that have -- that have gone wrong in this country, she would be a national security mess.
0.0	0.267280958861	This is a group of people that enslaves women and sells them, sells them as brides.
0.0	0.0602002486871	I got that.
0.0	0.187934831903	You have got to pick somebody who has experience, somebody that has the know-how, the discipline.
0.0	0.242137788089	And I have the feeling you're going to find a lot of cost overruns there and a lot of waste and duplicative activities.
0.0	0.285597578019	They get them on the black market.
1.0	0.34366317099	I've used it three times, maybe four times.
0.0	0.339348593187	We took it away from the NSA, it was a bad decision by the president.
0.0	0.0523263050941	We have not provided them.
0.0	0.258605822047	We need to be focusing on what fixes this country.
0.0	0.508274029675	I understand both of these issues, how to build the economy and doing that as a governor who'd built jobs, had cut taxes and also a governor who understands foreign-policy, and that's why I entered this race.
0.0	0.374478161736	I mean, she would drive a car until it wouldn't make a sound, and then gather up all her coins and buy a new car.
0.0	0.25127030549	I've got the backbone, I've got the band width, I've got the experience to get us through this.
0.0	0.396967211344	If you're running for president of the United States and you do not understand that we cannot defend this nation without more of our soldiers over there, you are not ready for this job.
0.0	0.313638523004	We can't afford another four years of that.
1.0	0.988945815732	And yet they are seeing almost all new income and all new wealth going to the top 1 percent.
0.0	0.140400166434	A lot of interesting issues have come together.
0.0	0.257539880968	Without China, North Korea doesn't even eat.
0.0	0.363386377301	Look, the truth is that a powerful nation like the United States, certainly working with our allies, we can overthrow dictators all over the world.
0.0	0.5	A flat tax for everybody -- no exemptions, no deductions, no shelters, because some people have a better capability of taking advantage of those than others.
0.0	0.320406088734	We are not the world's policeman, but we need to stand up and be ready.
0.0	0.120411821116	It's harder to talk to your enemies.
0.0	0.417065641999	Then you have to get rid of Larry Kudlow, who sits on your panel, who's a great guy, who came out the other day and said, I love Trump's tax plan.
0.0	0.0732890011976	Alzheimers, diabetes, heart disease and cancer.
0.0	0.0756495000448	They will -- some will follow.
0.0	0.037816523051	You find me...
0.0	0.200275673277	The fact of the matter is we're not going to have peace -- we are not going to have peace in Syria.
0.0	0.45795231798	We have 30,000 fewer state bureaucrats than the day I took office.
0.0	0.449124958402	... first of all, let me just tell you something -- and you know, because you just saw the numbers yourself -- NBC Wall Street Journal just came out with a poll -- headline: Trump way up, Cruz going down.
0.0	0.575560763435	There is one major country -- the United States -- which ends up spending almost three times per capita what they do in the U.K. guaranteeing health care to all people, 50 percent more than they do in France guaranteeing health care to all people, far more than our Canadian neighbors, who guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.134049981018	I didn't inherit any money.
0.0	0.181879669661	America was worth the wait.
0.0	0.270771859162	Let me just -- just say this.
0.0	0.349708638905	If you take donations from Wall Street, you can't be independent.
1.0	0.999997941604	We had a $1.4 trillion deficit.
0.0	0.530456704414	I don't think you expand entitlements when so many people are dependent on government and when the money the federal government is offering is going to be taken away from you after just a couple of years.
0.0	0.0749342536461	We had Hezbollah.
0.0	0.290637644228	Half of them had tears pouring down their face.
0.0	0.160207170239	They built the great wall of China.
0.0	0.0270803699227	And so that was his explanation.
0.0	0.517830665583	We cut taxes and we had a $5 trillion projected surplus when I left.
0.0	0.105409113326	That's what I said.
0.0	0.062982877173	They get -- they steal them.
0.0	0.33204543044	He is not the only one.
0.0	0.369709177179	That cost gets passed on to the people.
0.0	0.132911774926	That's what I've done in Louisiana, that's what I'll do in America.
0.0	0.436046574285	And remember this, after Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have had nearly 8 years, we have fewer democracies in the world than we had when they started.
0.0	0.404731431906	We need to incent private savings and make sure that Social Security is protected for those that have it.
0.0	0.0871418617981	This guy is a petulant child.
0.0	0.430931263067	We have a $19 trillion bipartisan debt and it continues to grow as we borrow money from countries that do not like us to pay for government we cannot afford.
0.0	0.417413141818	You know, you go to the internet, you start reading an article and you go to the comments section -- you cannot go five comments down before people are calling each all manner of names.
0.0	0.0777357629795	Not everybody remembers that.
0.0	0.412260281078	If I'm the nominee, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.751813079593	No.
0.0	0.379505494117	And, we have a government and leaders in government that are completely out of touch, and that's why I'm running for president.
0.0	0.16762205256	And that's what we should focus on is the violence in our communities.
0.0	0.339039821718	But it doesn't change my view that we need to empower everyone, women and men, to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make.
0.0	0.337782359381	One principle, for example, we've got to embrace is on immigration.
0.0	0.329375401427	And women have been disadvantaged ever since.
0.0	0.229349744393	I've got one more question for you then.
0.0	0.222796962364	That's why I ask for your support for president.
0.0	0.119744708963	If we do that again, we will lose again, we will deserve to lose again.
0.0	0.276384777071	Marco stood with Chuck Schumer and Barack Obama on amnesty.
0.0	0.0218371443474	You do legislation.
0.0	0.196177012336	He is undermining our standing in the world.
0.0	0.171101666704	The planes are older than the pilots.
0.0	0.104725942237	I think he is right.
0.0	0.129971186647	I love this country.
0.0	0.510964042692	It's now half the size of what it was prior to Operation Desert Storm.
0.0	0.417043758071	And that problem is too big regulations like the EPA, too much new taxes on business that we have seen and "Obamacare."
0.0	0.23181410674	I'll tell you what else people are concerned about.
0.0	0.388370747689	But the ideal scenario is to train Americans to do the work so we don't have to rely on people from abroad.
0.0	0.304289994388	We've saved billions of dollars.
0.0	0.210949575733	Madam Secretary, that is a low blow.
0.0	0.368402422062	I put together the coalition that imposed the sanctions on Iran that got us to the negotiating table to put a lid on their nuclear weapons program.
0.0	0.39589567527	I will, with your help and support, lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.141494951259	The other issue is mental health.
0.0	0.0349813192013	We need a doer, not a talker.
0.0	0.383747058682	But I have no argument with anyone making up her mind about who to support.
0.0	0.23213476962	I find -- I mean, it's just a very different, you know, historical perspective here.
0.0	0.28413924608	They have to come into this country legally.
0.0	0.413263365963	We should be deporting criminals, not hardworking immigrant families who do the very best they can and often are keeping economies going in many places in our country.
0.0	0.103995989833	Here's the bottom line.
0.0	0.751813079593	No their not.
0.0	0.250356137876	We're a country of laws, Bill.
0.0	0.045443283837	Here's -- here's our plan.
0.0	0.438987010997	But I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost.
0.0	0.256649106541	Because the more you tax something, the less of it you get.
0.0	0.308424870597	That is the way to deal with China at the end of the day.
0.0	0.297572615453	And that's the way my parents came legally in 1956.
0.0	0.25675862228	But for that Texas police officer, we could have had a mass murder.
0.0	0.0810063332124	Yes.
0.0	0.43485997233	But, by the way, when it comes to a woman having to make a very personal choice, ah, in that case, my Republican colleagues love the government and want the government to make that choice for every woman in America.
0.0	0.345677223601	And when we live by those laws and we treat everybody equally under the law, that's when people feel good about being Americans.
0.0	0.432667401425	I would begin by saying that I'm not sure it's a weakness, but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for America's future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people.
0.0	0.481428874422	Number one, you have people in this country that...
0.0	0.0698465807621	I'll check for you.
0.0	0.0655511499365	Play by the rules.
0.0	0.40175543307	That, I think, between the two of us demonstrates the strength of the support we have among people who want to see change in our country.
0.0	0.143864864633	I suspect you may have.
0.0	0.328535846833	Someone's going to be collecting this tax.
0.0	0.251791623031	We had Iran putting operatives in South America and Central America.
0.0	0.117424006876	Not a very pleasant place to be.
0.0	0.39529602195	It's all about getting people to listen to one another's problems.
0.0	0.308970120508	John, I -- if I -- a lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.316101364002	They're taking money from Social Security and they're going to spend it on the military and they're going to spend it on domestic spending.
0.0	0.154926010233	Let me tell you who Larry Tribe is.
0.0	0.381749372789	Well, first of all, recognize it is a substantial problem.
0.0	0.0416775279444	I love China.
0.0	0.112559118518	That's all I'm saying.
0.0	0.173655073606	After the war we had all of these kids, Baby Boomers.
0.0	0.328565243782	And you had better get rid of them, because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.0819876104673	That's not right.
0.0	0.410711536877	I think now what I've called for is counsel for every child so that no child has to face any kind of process without someone who speaks and advocates for that child so that the right decision hopefully can be made.
0.0	0.413284609867	I think what President Obama did was to exemplify the importance of this issue as our first African American president, and to address it both from the President's office, and through his advocacy, such as working with young men, and Mrs. Obama's work with young women.
0.0	0.334715295079	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.751813079593	We do.
0.0	0.0923176896746	What -- what -- you're from New York?
0.0	0.39383019387	... that after the 9/11 attacks, Secretary Rumsfeld invited me to the Pentagon with a meeting of the former secretaries of Defense.
0.0	0.184322914493	It is absolutely absurd to say that I had any kind of a relationship with them.
1.0	0.00627237134342	They stole it.
0.0	0.173411592684	Not the change we need at a time we need it.
0.0	0.468229078237	My four children have been able to receive a good Christian education, and I've been able to save for them to go to college so they never have to have the loans that I did.
0.0	0.0287724542214	That's my view.
0.0	0.313437141293	They know that this country is not respected around the world anymore.
0.0	0.311377628446	And then we need to shut down -- we need to shut down their mechanisms of funding and attack their command-and-control centers.
0.0	0.0372503394204	He was on the board.
0.0	0.482232399689	And we should back up the recent donors conference to make sure we have made our contribution to try to deal with the enormous cost that these refugees are posing to Turkey and to members of the E.U.
0.0	0.385595493936	Every penny we needed from -- every penny we got from Social Security, because my sister was a minor, we needed.
0.0	0.202473897215	I am deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.5	Well, first off, let's face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.139439308061	And you're not serious about destroying ISIL.
0.0	0.417105023144	I'm also going to take a bottle of White-Out with me to get started on all those executive orders that Mr. Obama has put his name to.
0.0	0.523900308223	If you saw that blimp that got cut loose from Maryland today, it's a perfect example of government.
0.0	0.411551138191	Why in God's name does Wall Street make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.0444881130138	You can have him.
0.0	0.198451771174	We just want to be the rich."
0.0	0.41657149773	I mean the fact is, is that they need to put the pressure on and frankly we need to intercepts ships coming out of North Korea so they don't proliferate all these dangerous materials.
0.0	0.415553510142	Well, they're the ones not listening to the scientists today, because doctors say that at 20 weeks that is a viable life inside the womb.
0.0	0.180953676298	And it's available on paperback, if you're interested in buying my book.
0.0	0.377178067243	I do not believe a vote in 2002 is a plan to defeat ISIS in 2016.
0.0	0.357264991041	Someone who's going to stand up, and be very clear with our enemies as to the lines their going to draw and stand with them.
0.0	0.395565392115	I have seen him appoint people to our courts not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.131414967362	We need to get realistic about this.
0.0	0.294524778301	We cannot be the world's policeman.
0.0	0.376201309966	We have ISIS and al Qaeda attacking us.
0.0	0.384874373918	Our average contribution is $27 dollars, I'm very proud of that.
0.0	0.468209836061	Well, I'll tell you something: you can take everything from the top 1 percent, and you apply it to our fiscal gap, and you won't even make a dent in it.
0.0	0.751813079593	No, you did.
0.0	0.381655113945	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
1.0	0.988253442838	They were wrong.
0.0	0.317183913471	We need to arm the Kurds the directly.
0.0	0.014157815926	We bailed them out.
0.0	0.252416423526	You target the bad guys.
0.0	0.138083354135	But I guess I'm supposed to come out great.
0.0	0.344085180921	I like Chris Christie, but we can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports Common Core.
0.0	0.252161140444	It's got great people, it's got loving people, wonderful people.
0.0	0.332159052881	We're on the verge of being the first generation of Americans that leave our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.484934628989	I want to find out why those two young people -- those two horrible young people in California when they shot the 14 people, killed them -- people they knew, people that held the wedding reception for them.
0.0	0.391274918791	I'm asking people to support me because I think I'm the most qualified, experienced, and ready person to be the president and the commander- in-chief.
0.0	0.539491537524	Any connection maybe to the fact that our people pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs?
0.0	0.279422924284	Probably, I don't know -- you people write the stuff.
0.0	0.380597600742	I can't speak for the Koch Brothers, you're referring to a Super PAC that we don't coordinate with, that was set up to support President Obama, that has now decided that they want to support me.
0.0	0.413605276924	But if you want someone who has a proven, effective leadership, that was a governor of a state, that transformed the culture there, elect me so I can fight for the American people and change the culture in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.285260045087	It's time for us to stand up for what we believe in.
0.0	0.506264384888	One thing I like to remind people is, back in 2007, Rudy Giuliani was leading the polls for almost a year.
0.0	0.296434388217	But what happened is a political vacuum developed.
0.0	0.385920391268	It was LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations in this country.
0.0	0.29864170942	Which is what we're gonna get if we elect a big government liberal like Hillary Clinton to the White House.
0.0	0.330080585564	... and I know Bernie, and I can promise you he's not going to be president of the United States.
0.0	0.242553621054	If you want someone who's not going to divide Washington, but gets things done, then you should make me your president.
0.0	0.356394023774	The New York Times a few weeks back had a columnist who wrote a column saying, "Anybody But Cruz."
0.0	0.389976606381	They come from another country and they're immediately sent out.
0.0	0.614327079156	When I left the workforce, New York State had been reduced by over 15 percent.
0.0	0.287394613247	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.450962547968	And nobody, nobody on either one of these stages has done more than I've done and the people of the State of Texas to deal with securing that border.
0.0	0.0819876104673	That is not right.
0.0	0.401297307621	Because they're recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees.
0.0	0.437438912663	I've set forth very specific plans about how to get costs down, especially prescription drug costs.
0.0	0.219231927864	Let people play, who cares?
0.0	0.00619474595643	I am against the raids.
0.0	0.294951140943	Well, he appointed Eric Holder as attorney general.
0.0	0.329166989365	So let's demand open trade but fair trade in this country.
1.0	0.981579849911	And the reason I said that is because the FBI director told the American people, told Congress, that he could not guarantee he could vet them and it would be safe.
0.0	0.318248716148	And then the Government steps in to try and solve the problem and we get a little further down to that progressive vision that Hillary Clinton is talking about.
0.0	0.231229051679	No one here is under FBI investigation.
0.0	0.155861171177	And he was a managing general partner.

0.0	0.391515881669	If I am president of the United States, we're going to send soldiers back to Iraq, back to Syria, to keep us from being attacked here and keep soldiers in Afghanistan because we must.
0.0	0.224864610724	We need a unifier, not a cynical divider in chief, and that's exactly what I will do.
0.0	0.148288450373	Well, I've learned the rules on this.
0.0	0.432201935629	This president every chance he has ever gotten has tried to undermine the Second Amendment.

0.0	0.108419579577	I'd consider it.

0.0	0.061658811062	And you know what?
0.0	0.381655113945	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.481787640291	So, yes, I do believe that when we talk about public education in America, today, in a rapidly changing world, we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities.

0.0	0.255140307651	I think the times are different now.
0.0	0.51552052481	My program would move the 104 programs of the federal Department of Education into four block grants, and send them back to the states because income inequality is driven by a lack of skills when kids don't get what they need to be able to compete and win in this country.

0.0	0.322771767194	But Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term, and you should be showing up to work.
0.0	0.176116938377	And I'm not blaming these folks -- well, I guess I could.
0.0	0.53098602661	I believe that we need to cut these taxes down, we need to be on a roadmap to balancing the budget, and we need to send power, money, and influence, the welfare department, the education department, job training, infrastructure, Medicaid, all of that out of Washington back to the states so we can run these programs from where we live to the top, not a one size fits all mentality that they have in Washington.
0.0	0.467367381842	You know how many votes John McCain missed when he was carrying out that furious comeback that you're now modeling after?
0.0	0.459347248339	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.423980072263	That's the way it should be, and I'm going to continue to reach out to thank all my online contributors for everything they are doing for me, to encourage them and help me do more just as Senator Sanders is.

0.0	0.435957709498	Regulations in this country are out of control, especially the Employment Prevention Agency, the EPA, and all of the rules they continue to impose on our economy and hurting us.
0.0	0.201064098066	They can't even make a deal.
0.0	0.525117992596	If my memory is correct, I think when we saw children coming from these horrendous, horrendously violent areas of Honduras and neighboring countries, people who are fleeing drug violence and cartel violence, I thought it was a good idea to allow those children to stay in this country.

0.0	0.167887753487	This is the fantasy that I talked about in the beginning.
0.0	0.553609504777	I have a concrete plan to do just that, which allows people to keep HSAs to encourage savings, it allows for people that are retiring with Social Security to be able to get a minimum of 125 percent of the poverty level so that there is a baseline that in this generous country of ours no one goes below.
0.0	0.532461173923	But nobody can deny that as a wartime leader, he rallied the British people when they stood virtually alone against the Nazi juggernaut and rallied them and eventually won an extraordinary victory.
0.0	0.00935646262137	That is not what America should be about.
0.0	0.401634373524	And it troubles me that people are rewarded for tearing down our country.
0.0	0.210106336674	And the problem today is there's no confidence in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.314441789344	Are you concerned like I am that the debt and deficits of Washington, D.C. are endangering America's future?
0.0	0.4318538337	I far prefer that and the chances we have to be successful there than trying to start all over again, gridlocking our system, and trying to get from zero to 100 percent.
0.0	0.385059136831	Martha, we got a lot of politicians that will kiss babies, cut ribbons, do whatever it takes to be popular.
0.0	0.592483790876	I would just say, I debated then Senator Obama numerous times on stages like this, and he was the recipient of the largest number of Wall Street donations of anybody running on the Democratic side ever.
0.0	0.215792110897	Listen, we -- this is the greatest country in the history of mankind.
0.0	0.550288291283	It is imposed on business and a critical piece that Marco seems to be missing is that this 16 percent business flat tax enables us to eliminate the corporate income tax.
0.0	0.5	I've seen so much of it - a Soviet Union, the coming down of a wall, the issues that we saw around the world in Central America, the potential spread of communism, and 9/11 and Gulf War.
0.0	0.293317387131	Oh yeah, we want to elect a good president, but America is great from the bottom-up, and the bottom-up is us in our families, in our communities, in our neighborhoods.
0.0	0.491104466389	We have to support the fighters on the ground, principally the Arabs and the Kurds who are willing to stand up and take territory back from Raqqa to Ramadi.
0.0	0.312703357872	Well, look, I think that she's been saying that for as long as I've known her, which is about 25 years.
0.0	0.329921114715	I'm not anti-Wall Street, but I don't believe the government ought to wear a team jersey, pick winners and losers.
0.0	0.318195453307	But I recall when Secretary Clinton ran against then-Senator Obama, she was critical of him for suggesting that maybe you want to talk to Iran, that you want to talk to our enemies.
1.0	0.450778506957	And I know this, because when I ran for governor of New York, one in 11 of every man, woman, and child in the state of New York was on welfare.
0.0	0.142611177468	He's a major Hillary Clinton supporter.
0.0	0.228912043499	You know, I have two sons.
0.0	0.127075853348	We just can't do it any longer.
0.0	0.392983877443	You know I understand why Donald made the comments he did and I understand why Americans are feeling frustrated and scared and angry when we have a president who refuses to acknowledge the threat we face and even worse, who acts as an apologist for radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.539472510974	The main problem with Medicare right now is that the average person pays in taxes over their whole lifetime about $100,000.
0.0	0.0234513379694	They are not perfect.
0.0	0.459823603441	And that's why this study, which shows that if you can believe it today, for white working class people between 45 and 54, life expectancy is actually going down.
0.0	0.255915705194	So I just truly, with all my heart belief, I like everybody on the stage.
0.0	0.137141765278	...This is a matter not of math, this is a matter of morality.
0.0	0.225455433143	So yeah, someone who makes more money...
1.0	0.977407445619	Everybody voted for it wanting to see Libya move toward democracy, of course we all wanted to do that.
0.0	0.210130824703	Well, when you look at the celebrity of Donald Trump, then I think that says a lot about it.
0.0	0.335854252246	You know, she only had a third-grade education, but -- you know, she knew how to stretch a dollar.
0.0	0.445676461617	I agree, however, it doesn't go far enough, because what it focuses on are the big banks, which Senator Sanders has talked about a lot, for good reason.
0.0	0.422294163205	Not all of his top national security advisors agreed with that.
0.0	0.336452651298	He got endorsed by the Sun-Sentinel because he was the most talented guy in the field.
0.0	0.199276644083	We have to get the remaining 10.
0.0	0.266757186458	And so it was (inaudible) his statement, which is why I'm asking him to consider changing his views.
0.0	0.481477673232	You know how much money we spent on polio last year in America?
0.0	0.348609616654	We're going to cut Social Security to help you.
0.0	0.22610125472	In fact, we need to -- wait a minute -- we need vigilance.
0.0	0.298838822505	We're going to fight it as hard as we can, and we're going to fight whoever the Republicans nominate who will depend on the Koch Brothers, and others.
0.0	0.432313317167	Now I think an area in kind of a vague way, or not so vague, where Secretary Clinton and I disagree is the area of regime change.
0.0	0.119861288258	That is not consistent conservatism, that is political calculation.
0.0	0.19289996739	I don't -- look, I don't think anybody should be expanding Medicaid.
0.0	0.338853335061	But honestly, if you're a small business owner today you are being crushed.
0.0	0.428889162523	There is a bill sitting in the House that would actually pass and have us go to zero-based budgeting so we know where every dime of your money is being spent instead of only talking about how much more we're going to spend year after year after year.
0.0	0.185288913667	And, you know, we have a whole variety of things that they can do and they can do these things simultaneously.
0.0	0.375834696103	I had to answer every single question about every single result and every single projection in public until there were no more questions.
0.0	0.034550125231	I changed that.
0.0	0.132211086836	Well, you're talking about -- yeah.
0.0	0.351362728207	And this president, given what Ted said right at the beginning, he's absolutely right.
0.0	0.384536639141	But Maria, radical Islamic terrorism was not invented 24 months ago; 24 months ago, we had Al Qaida.
0.0	0.151126093773	This isn't the governments money.
0.0	0.310719661074	Freedom is personal for me, and I will always keep my word and fight for freedom.
0.0	0.317780248952	So you know, I had to report results every 90 days in excruciating detail.
0.0	0.123920721503	Yes, it's very simple.
0.0	0.119668973311	You know, that's so simple.
0.0	0.2762512413	Our healthcare is a horror show.
0.0	0.10031229415	Here's a fact.
1.0	0.991356440263	If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world -- and we double tax, as you know.
0.0	0.369455214975	I want to tackle those barriers that stand in the way of too many Americans right now.
0.0	0.18445399407	Maria, Neil, thank you for a great debate tonight.
0.0	0.416656206948	And I took on the drug companies and I took on the insurance companies to try to get us universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.411830847385	Why does the pharmaceutical industry make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.426512032802	I think they made the Second Amendment the second amendment because they thought it was just that important.
0.0	0.434685340908	He appointed Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, someone who has been a radical against the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.
0.0	0.0805502025098	Well, I did.
0.0	0.401082614271	I've created tens of thousands of jobs, and in all due respect -- and actually some of these folks I really like a lot -- but I'm the only one that can say that.
0.0	0.387523591616	And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word.
0.0	0.032300398563	So I have voiced criticisms.
0.0	0.513711934929	Really systemic racism in this state, as in others, education, in employment, in the kinds of factors that too often lead from a position where young people, particularly young men, are pushed out of school early, are denied employment opportunities.
0.0	0.138592903094	My name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.378490553493	People have worked their entire lives.
0.0	0.181019187759	We have to put more money.
0.0	0.447960874638	I just want to thank all my colleagues here for being civil, and not falling for the traps.
0.0	0.0268656405264	We have no borders.
0.0	0.552775170677	You're looking at the -- at the man who introduced and fought on the floor as a freshman senator and passed the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 over two President Clinton vetoes.
0.0	0.493718037066	When millions of Americans rose up against Obamacare, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.463458564521	We will rebuild the military to make sure that it is a solid force, not to be the world's policeman, but to make sure that in a peaceful world, people know that the United States is there to take care of our own national interests and take care of our allies.
0.0	0.228334546061	So it wasn't just me who opposed it.
0.0	0.302117839871	The questions that are being asked shouldn't be trying to get people to tear into each other.
0.0	0.257152566236	You know why three?
0.0	0.262028703928	And our economy was growing like crazy.
0.0	0.485812000467	Three pages is about the maximum that a single business owner or a farmer or just a couple can understand without hiring somebody.
0.0	0.377111038904	You know, I listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas.
0.0	0.348408576112	The first thing is we have to strengthen our alliances around the world.
0.0	0.39398044903	It's a -- it's absolutely disgraceful that Secretary Kerry and others said in their response to what's going on in Iran that this was a good thing; it showed how the relationship was getting better.
0.0	0.13729377952	John, I'll tell you something.
0.0	0.066803287717	I don't care.
0.0	0.47693559456	African-Americans who face discrimination in the job market, education, housing, and the criminal justice system.
0.0	0.0430444766078	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.258122035465	While there are lots of good ideas for reform, we have never tackled the basics.
0.0	0.358905145349	But, what we did is we said to the working families of this country, look, we know things are tough, but if you want to help us go beyond establishment politics, and establishment economics, send us something.
0.0	0.434779858902	No, I said, " I would use -- " they were asking me what to do about North Korea.
0.0	0.122754109513	He wants to change America.
0.0	0.154785078091	The economy was really booming.
0.0	0.424440747782	Well, I wish you would have asked that question years ago when they broke it.
0.0	0.0982608675004	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.17194471191	I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King.
0.0	0.456617139331	Absolutely, because what we will do is say, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so they're not hanging out on street corners.
0.0	0.205684887662	We have been debating right here the core difference between conservatism and progressivism.
0.0	0.48248392243	Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well.
0.0	0.347114933085	But realistically, even if they do, the money is flowing.
0.0	0.0602331151715	Not bad.
0.0	0.456240731329	So, we're talking about -- we're talking about reform for people like me and people like Senator Cruz, as he talked about earlier, who are years away from retirement that have a way to plan for these changes, and way that's very reasonable.
0.0	0.476262774701	Where the secretary and I have a very profound difference, in the last debate -- and I believe in her book -- very good book, by the way -- in her book and in this last debate, she talked about getting the approval or the support or the mentoring of Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.27279191082	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.296090440177	So we need new leadership -- yes.
0.0	0.108775375822	No criminal records for them.
0.0	0.163002018158	...we need to honor our promises...
0.0	0.440263402453	And, you know the old inscription, if you save one life, you've changed the world.
0.0	0.0786864604441	You're simply not.
0.0	0.0970742989206	But we have a serious problem.
0.0	0.400667310402	The way to take that away from them is to talk to our military officials and ask them, "what do you need in order to accomplish this goal?"
0.0	0.233039002769	You know, I think my biggest weakness is exactly the opposite.
0.0	0.0291687512209	They are refusing to...
0.0	0.471053780302	Today, we have a legal immigration system for permanent residency that is largely based on whether or not you have a relative living here.
0.0	0.298262121006	They're making a half, two-thirds what they used to make.
0.0	0.17343928245	There's no way he launches 11 attack --
0.0	0.456864614692	If a person lives in a seven room house, does the government get to say you don't need seven rooms, we're going to take two of them away?
0.0	0.435076437164	In fact, it's the chief argument by democrats against many of the different flat tax proposals.
0.0	0.057947453414	Excuse me, John.
0.0	0.278726567413	Well, Senator, look, I think we're in vigorous agreement here.
0.0	0.0919541133585	My point is this.
1.0	0.980938136323	And in Libya, for example, the United States, Secretary Clinton, as secretary of state, working with some other countries, did get rid of a terrible dictator named Gadhafi.
0.0	0.349248583694	You can campaign, or just resign and let someone else take the job.
0.0	0.0786986981749	How do we decide on who gets to follow up?
0.0	0.363965638557	And when America does not lead, the world is a dangerous and a tragic place.
0.0	0.189755242452	Neil, my name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.191138373038	They are -- they're in a position where they're smothering people.
0.0	0.413020016408	You know, 200 years ago, America was founded on this powerful principle that our rights don't come from government.
0.0	0.292843337274	Look, the Second Amendment is not an option.
0.0	0.183714861271	We hear a lot of good plans.
0.0	0.00879754395872	There is no other description of it.
0.0	0.596551243852	He used chemical weapons, he's killed, now, over a quarter of a million of his own people, and this president has done nothing.
0.0	0.405677520829	And specifically, we know that we could have detected and repelled some of these cyber attacks if that collaboration had been permitted.
0.0	0.173937990475	Well, John, I don't really have any weaknesses that I can think of.
0.0	0.160476011242	Let me say on that...
0.0	0.188316754866	He doesn't meet -- here's the difference.
1.0	0.993379656049	My price tag is about $100 billion a year.
0.0	0.284453231176	Here, we actually need 1,000 because we have natural barriers.
0.0	0.140097374578	Their family is waiting for them.
0.0	0.279356549749	What we should do is to be investing in all types of energy, John, all types of energy.
0.0	0.172819643987	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the Constitution.
0.0	0.440988065979	Planned Parenthood had better hope that Hillary Clinton wins this election, because I guarantee under President Jindal, January 2017, the Department of Justice and the IRS and everybody else that we can send from the federal government will be going in to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.0556466596415	You can't have a question.
0.0	0.135365684947	They don't want them made here.
0.0	0.323518014632	In my view, it doesn't go anywhere near far enough.
0.0	0.0488794872385	They're a scam.
0.0	0.129435788388	My background is different.
0.0	0.344101962379	If we don't stop them over there, they are coming here just as sure as I stand here in front of you.
0.0	0.0263756789282	What's crony capitalism?
0.0	0.0614969517192	That is beyond unspeakable.
0.0	0.303378215861	There is a radical jihadist group that is manipulating our immigration system.
0.0	0.484115090886	We raised the military spending, took from entitlements, and raised domestic spending and the deficit will explode under this.
0.0	0.139525811364	Well I want to comment on this.
0.0	0.377615355675	Our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.5084890255	But what is to prevent a future liberal president or a liberal Congress from coming back and not just raising the income tax, but also raising that VAT tax, and that vat tax is really bad for seniors.
0.0	0.274991559827	And if I misrepresented those results or those projections in any way, I was held criminally liable.
0.0	0.406255749925	Why don't we just give a chicken in every pot, while we're, you know, coming up -- coming up with these fantasy tax schemes.
0.0	0.517846117286	When millions of Americans rose up against amnesty, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.302985279495	Actually a close friend.
0.0	0.381772017382	We have the Russians and the Iranians working together, not to fight ISIS, but to prop up Assad.
0.0	0.381714979257	But they need to see leadership, support and resolve from the United States of America, and we can help them defeat ISIS.
0.0	0.225187985578	So let's start -- let's start with immigration.
0.0	0.114924724829	I've laid out...
0.0	0.4270994096	Because that person should not have gotten a gun, should not -- would not have passed a background check.
0.0	0.194069229231	I don't recall them calling for his resignation --
0.0	0.316889913034	If this country that does not keep its promise to seniors then what promise can this country hope to be trusted to keep?
0.0	0.226538037869	Marco voted on the other side.
0.0	0.312792962229	They know we will be committed to victory.
0.0	0.260411198494	I will be the Ronald Reagan if I can find a Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.392532668215	And for 30 years, the issue of immigration has been about someone who's in this country, maybe they're here illegally, but they're looking for a job.
0.0	0.196928877373	We both have a lot of small donors.
0.0	0.456442560091	Everybody said it was going to be three hours, three and a half, including them, and in about two minutes I renegotiated it so we can get the hell out of here.
0.0	0.0573889557369	He's a gifted politician.
0.0	0.186146285494	So you know what needs to happen, it's a very simple equation, and it's going to happen when I'm president.
0.0	0.0263721838952	I win.
0.0	0.0904183169661	Just a little bit.
0.0	0.517340638427	The fact is, in order to get this economy moving again, I call for freezing regulations for a year except for the problem of public safety.
0.0	0.202233544619	So the indignation that you carry on, some of the stuff, you have to also own then.
0.0	0.229203564818	But bottom line is: The president is right.
0.0	0.364404649235	And I'll tell you what, Donald, you -- you very kindly just a moment ago offered me the V.P.
0.0	0.261891809095	And he said, oh, I'm never going to attack.
0.0	0.58110617081	I voted against it because the Southern Poverty Law Center, among other groups, said that the guest-worker programs that were embedded in this agreement were akin to slavery.
0.0	0.22640197539	Everyone up here tonight that's talking about reforms, I think and I know for myself I speak to this, we're all talking about reforms for future generations.
0.0	0.223006544269	It's what I've done or not done, or it's war.
0.0	0.304631640344	I think, actually, people are looking for that in Washington now.
0.0	0.31695884516	You know, of the few questions I've got, the last one I need is to give him some more time.
0.0	0.14064157295	We're laughed at all over the world.
0.0	0.510046748565	...One more time, in Ohio, our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.0983289893749	... he's really doing some bad...
0.0	0.0507488179271	Well, it ain't Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.0984710399958	It continues with regulatory reform.
0.0	0.171748261676	I saw them come down.
0.0	0.10472592693	There are politics in the boardroom as well.
0.0	0.224173088932	We sent our Texas ranger recon teams.

0.0	0.10406264888	Let's listen to them and let's not listen to our politicians.
0.0	0.100738451617	These are drags on the economy, it's a deliberate drag.
0.0	0.463372860532	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the free enterprise system.

0.0	0.128054004753	It was Countrywide Mortgage.
0.0	0.00280881569458	Thank you.
1.0	0.373498972615	But I will -- but I will tell you this, the socialist says they're going to pay for everything and give you everything for free, except they don't say they're going to raise it through taxes to 90 percent to do it.
0.0	0.136787490214	China and Russia have never been on our side of the table.

0.0	0.218491168007	I'll tell you, in my family there are a lot of single moms in my family.
0.0	0.359449294465	We have to get the other 10 percent of the way to 100.
0.0	0.283546511793	And that's why, as president, I will look at communities that need special help and try to deliver that.
0.0	0.338361108195	When you look at raising the debt limit, it should be leverage to try to reform government.
0.0	0.262703121825	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.243791919798	And I think Ted Kennedy had a very clear idea about what needed to be done.
0.0	0.183227834823	It can not be someone that agrees with his agenda.
0.0	0.300155683095	It enables us to eliminate the death tax.

0.0	0.0134726783916	On welfare.

0.0	0.430014624501	Maria, I'd like to interrupt this debate on the floor of the Senate to actually answer the question you asked, which was on entitlements.
0.0	0.264034783327	That's why I've entered this race, and I think I have the experience to do it.
0.0	0.0447801250595	And, thank you everybody.
0.0	0.187675974329	And that's why I think these ideas up here are great, and that's what we should have is have more discussions like this and less gotcha.
0.0	0.112818217706	So we need to get on a different mindset.
0.0	0.182914161586	CRUZL But I will say --
0.0	0.253494578644	We need to make sure that we keep the country safe.
0.0	0.447075831598	They want a political revolution in which millions of Americans stand up, come together, not let the Trumps of the world divide us, and say, you know what, in this great country, we need a government that represents all of us, not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.
0.0	0.377045710863	... you had two 110-story buildings come crashing down.
0.0	0.286337659296	I'm going to go to the commanders and say give me a plan to win.
0.0	0.314270053077	I -- I've been for pausing on admitting the Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.0405700514438	That's the difference.
0.0	0.25749436986	We do not have to have massive levels of income and wealth inequality.
0.0	0.460964053174	Are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the Assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire?
0.0	0.553542963656	I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years, and by the way, one of the members of that committee was Senator Strom Thurmond from South Carolina.
0.0	0.269500430976	We are in a war against ISIS.
0.0	0.304312405165	And that is that one of the things you're watching tonight are 11 quality candidates debating an important issue.
0.0	0.0252166549803	I agree with them.
0.0	0.455807618141	We're going to cut Medicare and Medicaid, federal aid to education to help you, because the government is so terrible.
0.0	0.481791635436	So, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities.
0.0	0.0209372179097	And I'm glad I did it.
0.0	0.286234605717	And they will work with me to get comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.412928760328	They don't care about American workers, they just care about bringing as many people in so they can get as many votes as they can.
0.0	0.281346437409	Are you coming onboard a proposal?
0.0	0.343932673981	...10% flat rate...
0.0	0.116984882858	This was a question on entitlements.
0.0	0.376489632051	But it is absolutely fair and necessary for Americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average American family?
0.0	0.249113490402	So yes, you're going to hear a lot of talk about tax reform --
0.0	0.751813079593	No, no.
0.0	0.361156518508	I want to go back to what we were talking about earlier, this budget deal in Washington.
0.0	0.0197787233787	But, here is the truth.
0.0	0.0698625256532	I'm prepared.
0.0	0.414853825025	We now have some good models about how better to provide employment, housing and education.
0.0	0.217014943902	John, I'd like to address this?
0.0	0.30130105856	It always seems to be the private marketplace does a better job.
0.0	0.471842710889	Yes, I believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on Wall Street, that they are a Wall Street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession -- Great Depression.
0.0	0.0101489898204	It's not constitutional.
0.0	0.321266107976	They lost a lot of money, everybody said it couldn't be done.
0.0	0.298986515708	I think that sets us apart from a lot of what's happening right now on the Republican side.
0.0	0.260123965781	The big corporations have the scale to deal with all of this.
0.0	0.418465500003	And when it comes to the issues that are really on the front lines as to whether we're going to have equal pay, paid family leave, some opportunity for, you know, women to go as far as their hard work and talent take them, I think that we still have some barriers to knock down, which is why that's at the core of my campaign.
0.0	0.462022510671	What we have to do right now is bring our people together and understand that we must provide a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people.
0.0	0.185306894383	I will not take advice from Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.421336516176	And this is one of the myths that the left perpetrates on our society, and this is how they frighten people and get people to shut up.
0.0	0.45315922971	I saw you on the Senate floor flip your vote on crop insurance because they told you it would help you in Iowa, and last week, we all saw you flip your vote on ethanol in Iowa for the same reason.
0.0	0.00280881569458	...Thank you.
0.0	0.297021815393	I did it as the chairman of the Budget Committee, working with Senator Domenici.
0.0	0.578394366813	You know, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took the oath of office in 1933 at a time when 25 percent of the American people were unemployed, country was in incredible despair.
0.0	0.138833409699	...I'm going to go to Washington to stop it...
0.0	0.0235787858712	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.33991800934	We elected someone as president who wants to change America, who wants to make it more like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.00280881569458	Thank you.
0.0	0.301542330161	Under -- under Barack Obama and the proposals of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and others, they've tried it their way, and it has failed miserably.
0.0	0.352993469218	What we need now is a proven leader who has produced results.
0.0	0.751813079593	And here's why.
0.0	0.235285295389	Let's talk about something that happened this week in the news.
0.0	0.329452660843	It'll be a pretty busy day, but that Iran negotiation is going to be torn up on day one.
0.0	0.0829269384713	I have Ivanka, and Eric and Don sitting there.
0.0	0.211453933519	I've been passionate my whole life about the Constitution.
0.0	0.602765602599	So yes, I will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year pay zero, zero in federal income tax.
0.0	0.488303722662	Look, in addition to what Donald was saying is we also need to talk about the legal immigration system for permanent residents.
0.0	0.0369015599152	No, not at all, absolutely not.
0.0	0.211259557849	This election has to be about reversing all of that damage.
0.0	0.180096341193	So, I think gun-free zones are a catastrophe.
1.0	0.97516352477	And on Common Core, Common Core has been eliminated in New Jersey.
0.0	0.205573843224	Finally, we'll take off the political handcuffs.
0.0	0.378727910496	So if you're having Medicare for all, single-payer, you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing.
0.0	0.424646896229	This isn't just the country I was born in, this is the nation that literally changed the history of my family.
0.0	0.151583136465	There'll be people here that will talk about what they're going to do.
0.0	0.105409113326	And, we said no.
0.0	0.343070416129	We came back from the dead.
0.0	0.192412235927	He was overthrown by British and American interests because he threatened oil interests of the British.
0.0	0.396175583905	So this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement.
0.0	0.297499808396	We don't have to have refugees come to our country, but all Muslims, seriously?

0.0	0.0517890852584	That was before he was running against me.

0.0	0.169770428521	I'd like to jump in.
0.0	0.751813079593	We have Dodd-Frank.
0.0	0.519029078577	First, we should pass the Expatriate Terrorist Act, legislation I've introduced that says if an American goes and joins ISIS and wages jihad against America, that you forfeit your citizenship and you can not come in on a passport.
0.0	0.236293730791	We feel like we're being left behind and left out.
0.0	0.458730863846	Everybody's record's going to be scrutinized, and at the end of the day we need to unite behind the winner so we can defeat Hillary Clinton, because she is a disaster.
0.0	0.475450139816	You have to reform Social Security, and the simple way to do it is to make sure that the wealthiest don't receive the same benefits as people that are lower-income.
0.0	0.11534091053	When you became president, you had a Democratic Congress and a filibuster-proof Democratic Senate.
0.0	0.490586292246	I don't think the founders put the Second Amendment as number two by accident.
0.0	0.370662965483	You know, in our country, there are a lot of people who feel as though they just don't have the power.
0.0	0.2220145889	Can you have Medicare or Social Security?
0.0	0.275296937193	We need a fighter for this country again.
0.0	0.109751921603	That is not what America is supposed to be about.

0.0	0.439580552761	The reason all of us are here is we believe we should be fighting for the working men and women of this country, and not Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.342825030902	It is disgraceful, and in a Christie administration, they would know much, much better than to do that.
0.0	0.412977788817	They have a sophisticated understanding of our legal immigration system and we now have an obligation to ensure that they are not able to use that system against us.

0.0	0.027217907281	OK?
1.0	0.974281748084	This president is undermining our military.
0.0	0.383835249177	But the leaders have come forward to realize that protest is fine, but violence is wrong.
0.0	0.302360833814	It was some of the most progressive members of the United States Congress who opposed it for that reason.
0.0	0.310199583238	Yesterday, the president stunningly admitted this.
0.0	0.430883386935	And when I left, we were stronger, we were safer, and we were more united than at any time in my lifetime.
0.0	0.168084282826	All of those things are important, and all those things would happen in a Christie administration.

0.0	0.118819155734	Take it from your professors...
0.0	0.362730482518	I'm interested in making sure we get the maximum amount of revenue from those who can well afford to provide it.
0.0	0.352664516477	I'm tired of seeing what's going on, between the border where the people flow over; people come in; they live; they shoot.

0.0	0.257855704651	And yes, it was a very difficult time.
0.0	0.200502451445	He is a good man.
0.0	0.12509853682	Are you serious about this election?
0.0	0.352307675875	I am the only person in either campaign that's self-funding.
0.0	0.466009033396	And the fact is those jobs are critical, they're hard working members of the middle class and they need to be paid attention to because they're Americans and they carry the load.
0.0	0.00280881569458	Thank you.
0.0	0.436630678846	I have no clue whether the federal government is the proper place, my instinct is to say, hell no, just about everything about the federal government.
0.0	0.43718059559	Well Maria, thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the New York Times.
0.0	0.157914659721	I know the Democrats have the ultimate SuperPac.
0.0	0.354954033007	...The only way we're going to be morale, the only way we're going to keep our promise to seniors is start by following the first rule we should all follow, which is to look at them, treat them like adults, and tell them the truth.
0.0	0.0369015599152	Absolutely.
0.0	0.145756701855	There's something going on and it's bad.
0.0	0.38382992976	But yes, there is more collaboration required between private sector companies and the public sector.
1.0	0.519279856078	Think about it: six and a half million people working part-time.
0.0	0.490316250141	And that's the reason that I've said under my presidency, we'll create jobs and make American the number one manufacturing country in the world.
0.0	0.212764629172	And they wonder whether somebody is getting something to -- keeping them from getting it.
0.0	0.456796423961	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.0278667945864	You once had a pension.
0.0	0.0886475242361	He's an S corporation.
0.0	0.0905683619962	We're running.
0.0	0.180024207533	You've got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.424239023477	And I agree about the role that he played both in war and in peace on the economy and defeating fascism around the world.
0.0	0.239888990993	We have to shut down their internet capability.
0.0	0.249367044793	I recommended that the president go forward.
0.0	0.0278887356239	It's the same thing that I did in Ohio.
0.0	0.461461968535	Governor Huckabee's exactly right, we need to honor the promises made to our seniors, but for younger workers -- look.
0.0	0.396837443356	Well, I would begin by reminding people that at this point in previous presidential elections, Jimmy Carter couldn't win, Ronald Reagan couldn't win, Bill Clinton couldn't win, and neither could've Barack Obama.
0.0	0.5	It's tax-free -- a huge advantage for our farmers and ranchers and manufacturers -- and every import pays the 16 percent business flat tax.
0.0	0.5	Well, I believe that there are abuses, those companies should be permanently barred from ever using the program again and we should put strict standards in place to ensure that they're not being abused, like the prevailing wage requirement and like the advertising requirement.
0.0	0.0920151396493	We saw it in the blimp.
0.0	0.238801334632	No, they don't like he beats the rest of the field, because they want me.
0.0	0.52915812189	One, with respect to the Central American children, I made it very clear that those children needed to be processed appropriately, but we also had to send a message to families and communities in Central America not to send their children on this dangerous journey in the hands of smugglers.
0.0	0.201011165606	But here's the point I want to make tonight.
0.0	0.102330587823	So here's this -- the situation, I think, Maria.
0.0	0.191926161645	We're going to let people in, but they're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.142609927764	I'm tired of the hyphenated Americans and the division.
0.0	0.177320287958	Now Maria, listen.
0.0	0.115472400431	You know, I am by my nature impatient.
0.0	0.148353309699	You get the Senate.
0.0	0.529221862975	And second, the First Amendment Defense Act, which is protecting religious liberty, if it's not passed by then, which I suspect it won't, because the president will veto it, I will institute an executive order to make sure that people of faith are not being -- not being harassed and persecuted by the federal government for standing up for the religious beliefs.
0.0	0.462267989811	We can put America back on track on a growth level and a growth rate that we've never seen in the history of this country.
0.0	0.461412204536	We'd rebuild infrastructure that would also create jobs in this country, and we'd work with the states to do it the right way, to do it more efficiently and more effectively.
0.0	0.330534873427	I'm very angry because our country is being run horribly and I will gladly accept the mantle of anger.
0.0	0.411324124231	What would motivate me and what would be the guiding light for me in terms of immigration reform, Judy, is to bring families together, not divide them up.
0.0	0.354943852921	It's poor people and middle class.
0.0	0.438677967286	And I'll note that California senator -- Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said, if she could say to Mr. America and Mrs. America, "give me your guns, I'm rounding them up," she would.
0.0	0.316721976972	He is the party's frontrunner right now, and good for him.
0.0	0.398338516595	But as Bill said earlier, Roe v. Wade, it's has been the law for 42 years, and I don't think we should continue to try to change it.
0.0	0.353926813028	We need to break the Washington cartel, and the only way to do it is to end all the subsidies and all...
0.0	0.381284290557	This has gone on 50 or 60 years where the United States has been involved in overthrowing governments.
0.0	0.245218451405	They're concerned that Washington is so dysfunctional it is holding them back.
0.0	0.371762377519	At the end of the day, ladies and gentlemen, our best days are ahead of us only if we work together, and I intend to put this country on a path of success by working together and doing the hard things that should have been done a very long time ago.
0.0	0.333147929577	And I also want to recognize the people in that church that showed the grace of God and the grace of forgiveness and the mercy that they showed.
0.0	0.101099353369	I believe we are on the path to doing that.
0.0	0.167980243515	Maria, I assume that I can respond to that.
0.0	0.173830553216	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.0474930492666	That's 13,000 miles.
0.0	0.474399028537	But all of my career, you know, having been raised in -- by a mailman father whose father was a coal miner, who died of black lung and was losing his eyesight; or a mother whose mother could barely speak English.
0.0	0.258599895763	Give Bernie Sanders credit.
0.0	0.27050035296	But if you want someone to drive you home, I will get the job done and I will get you home.
0.0	0.193860238456	And wherever you are sitting Nikki, I'm a friend.
0.0	0.332506606215	But I promise you, in the state of South Carolina, they do.
0.0	0.343118497184	And as president, I will rebuild the military and keep this country safe.
0.0	0.344169528544	But now as I travel the country, people say what I feel.
0.0	0.542295139988	Mine actually cuts the payroll tax, and I think it would spread the tax cut across all socioeconomic levels, and would allow then it to be something that would be broadly supported by the public in an election.
0.0	0.244395409478	And -- and -- you know, it goes back to the whole concept of regulations, which are in everything.
0.0	0.329611165889	It's you see the health insurance companies getting together.
0.0	0.341603903388	For 30 years this country has been baited with that.
0.0	0.539701444616	Because only if it's about three pages are you leveling the playing field between the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected who can hire the armies of lawyers and accountants and, yes, lobbyists to help them navigate their way through 73,000 pages.
0.0	0.377762254911	The natural next question is who actually has done so.
0.0	0.0604967456394	Yeah, they are unhinged.
0.0	0.370595788588	And meanwhile, small businesses are getting crushed.
0.0	0.159865898743	I'll tell you how optimistic I am about America.
0.0	0.376334143595	But Iran is at the heart of most of the evil that is going on in the Middle East through their proxies.
0.0	0.105839855009	I've been there 35 times.
0.0	0.41362437311	Mine is unique in the sense that my tax plan actually gets rid of the payroll tax as well.
0.0	0.280454779115	I'm going to be introducing a plan which I call the 2020 Perfect Vision for America.
0.0	0.241890845719	You know, every election we hear a lot of talk.
0.0	0.751813079593	...
0.0	0.25607503138	The Kurds are our strongest allies.
0.0	0.371931597034	... believe me the world is peanuts by comparison.
0.0	0.0100731522228	...John...
0.0	0.418980509135	We have to be prepared to defend the American people, prepare them for a long war, stand up for the defense of this country, and stand up for the values of this country...
0.0	0.293415959503	That will never happen when I am president of the United States.
0.0	0.284863023461	We were behind where we were today.
0.0	0.382453931852	So as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and the like.
0.0	0.314147896232	I want to speak to all of those maddened by political correctness, where Hillary Clinton apologizes for saying all lives matter.
0.0	0.354482096462	So they soybean sales from Iowa, entire soybean production goes -- the equivalent of it goes to China.
0.0	0.26992000346	Just for the record.
0.0	0.170850238536	We're going to get more revenue.
0.0	0.432616124548	The government is not supposed to be in every part of our lives, and that is what is causing the problem.
0.0	0.23507404172	I can tell you, there wouldn't have been much damage.
0.0	0.53483556317	Yes, I do believe that now after the American people bailed Wall Street out, yes, they should pay a Wall Street speculation tax so that we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.196038770402	I would put it in a blind trust.
0.0	0.472669957043	And I would note the other individuals on this stage were nowhere to be found in that fight.
0.0	0.109171360235	Unless you are clinically insane...
0.0	0.345322381086	Well, Maria, I'm glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what's going on in the world.
0.0	0.374650194834	I think it was a mistake to expand Medicaid everywhere in Ohio and across the country.
0.0	0.217290739619	The guns don't pull the trigger.
0.0	0.425462346679	And so he undermines the Constitution, and he undermines free enterprise by expanding government, and he betrays our allies and cuts deals with our enemies and guts our military.
0.0	0.518948640188	Suicide, alcoholism, drugs, that's why we need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country, and not just a handful of billionaires who have enormous economic and political power.
0.0	0.369547599384	Or, are you going to deal with the problem by saying, I'm going to give people who've done well in this country less benefit on the backend.
0.0	0.00280881569458	Thank you.
0.0	0.389962480353	The rest of the world is moving away from us towards other alliances because we are weak.
0.0	0.0819876104673	Right.
0.0	0.521573482684	But mostly, the highest calling of leadership is to challenge the status-quo and unlock the potential of others.
0.0	0.109962512956	And I'll tell you, it was heartbreaking.
1.0	0.464189579215	If you look at a single mom buying groceries, she sees hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent.
0.0	0.172491652955	We have been talking about it for decades.
0.0	0.380458821484	But I'm not worried about my finances, I'm worried about the finances of everyday Americans who today are struggling in an economy that is not producing good paying jobs while everything else costs more.
0.0	0.203618523692	He is -- this president is undermining the constitutional basis of this government.
0.0	0.228423392474	That has to be enforced absolutely with consequences for Iran at the slightest deviation from their requirements under the agreement.
0.0	0.33246732417	Well, gee, after the last debate, I was told that I didn't smile enough.
0.0	0.189889689186	We're going to create a border.
0.0	0.45269236447	I do believe that in the year 2016 we have to look in terms of public education as colleges as part of public education making public colleges and universities tuition free.
0.0	0.188103940812	Well, the deal was done.
0.0	0.233388534106	It will be a long day.
0.0	0.141911607651	You gotta be patient.
0.0	0.33145990613	You get, like, three days where you have to show up?
0.0	0.462873790732	That is the way we deal with global warming, climate change, or any of those problems, not through government intervention, not through government taxes, and for God's sake, don't send Washington another dime until they stop wasting the money they're already sending there.
0.0	0.47886857138	We have to end crony capitalism in Washington, where the lobbyists and the powerful can get tax breaks and tax credits, and the American people don't get laws in their interest.
0.0	0.4644282348	It shifts it to the business, and it would allow middle class people to get a tax cut.
0.0	0.272463913232	You know, we -- we agree that we've got to get unaccountable money out of politics.
0.0	0.148032920997	I'm against anything that's bad for my mother.
0.0	0.177937722412	Kamatsu (ph) is a tractor company in Japan.
0.0	0.0713650133267	No, it's your record.
0.0	0.175037277444	So you should go out, get a declaratory judgment, let the courts decide.
0.0	0.116320572145	(LAUGHTER) And he got nasty.
0.0	0.5	We ought to give them a little bit of a liability release so that they share data amongst themselves and share data with the federal government, they're not fearful of a lawsuit.
0.0	0.261858754754	This is why, fundamentally, we have to take our government back.
0.0	0.239214959916	I never said that.
0.0	0.288364958876	And I believe that the best way to do that is to be aggressive, to be principled, but to have the goal of trying to improve relations.
0.0	0.341031386277	We need to control the border, we need to do all of this in a comprehensive way, not just going back and forth and talking about stuff --
0.0	0.362438971369	So I believe that working with Europe -- and, by the way, you know, we've got some very wealthy countries there in that part of the world.

0.0	0.264910730462	Well, there is no evidence that they can fix anything in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.169988034972	But the president leads in this regard.

0.0	0.11262963087	Let me translate that for you.
0.0	0.343912413125	And -- and -- and I -- you know, Ben is absolutely right in saying that what we don't need to do is to send more money to Washington, D.C. to fix this problem.
0.0	0.41828558111	And I put forth an immigration policy that is as strong in favor of the folks who are struggling in America the most than anybody else.
0.0	0.449522237865	Maybe it's because I hadn't given money to the foundation or donated to his wife's Senate campaign.

0.0	0.46208636971	But Jeb is also right that, if we just impose a tariff, they'll put reciprocal tariffs, which will hurt Iowa farmers and South Carolina producers and 20 percent of the American jobs that depend on exports.

0.0	0.189454602578	If I could just respond.
0.0	0.368409270044	They shouldn't automatically assume that because you believe that marriage is between one man and one woman that you are a homophobe.
0.0	0.488889467754	If I could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited.

0.0	0.00254314008586	And we are not England.

0.0	0.459316661392	We need to begin by undoing -- I would begin by undoing a whole set of things that President Obama has done, whether it's illegal amnesty or this latest round of EPA regulations.

0.0	0.240077085855	We're going to be tough at the border, we're going to be tough on all of the illegal immigrants that everybody else in this field -- we're going to be different.
0.0	0.120648029177	I'm not fighting that.

0.0	0.210548114643	You know, let me say something at the outset.
0.0	0.5	And the only reason we got them back is because we owed them with a stupid deal, $150 billion.
0.0	0.385020234275	That is principally an American-led air campaign that we are now engaged in.
0.0	0.0107284741735	No vision at all.

0.0	0.368226101408	I don't think it's so much about when the government orders a corporation to do something.

0.0	0.341394076805	So I don't know if you would call that a weakness, but my wife said "let up."
0.0	0.404112133281	And frankly, it just came out, and in Iowa now, as you know, Ted, in the last three polls, I'm beating you.
0.0	0.584815523287	And the entire New York times attack -- is that I disclosed that loan on one filing with the United States Senate, that was a public filing.
0.0	0.0739907839927	I like it.
0.0	0.101069962095	It ain't going to happen.

0.0	0.027217907281	OK.
0.0	0.331806019176	So what we do, though, is, if there is somebody who is price- gouging, we have laws for prosecutors to take that on.
0.0	0.244257651428	And I'll tell you one thing that we never talk about -- we haven't talked about it tonight.
0.0	0.080441307453	Thank you, senator.
0.0	0.00726992051441	Divide that out.
0.0	0.482987720284	I was on morning Joe at a town hall and a young student stood up and said, "Can I still be idealistic?"
0.0	0.456902940551	And by the way, it's not just on immigration, you used to support TPA, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.163984244033	We need to rebuild our families.
0.0	0.313389005103	And that's why they have it in Europe, because it is a way to blindfolded the people, that's what Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.27215491512	You got Kuwait and you got Qatar and you got Saudi Arabia.
0.0	0.178531015395	I was down there, and I've never seen anything like it.
0.0	0.194148162421	I have fully endorsed those.
0.0	0.385859436596	But our goal is, in fact, to try over a period of time to, in fact, deal with our enemies, not just ignore that reality.
0.0	0.552681840096	Twenty-four months ago, 36 months ago, you did not have a group of radical crazies named ISIS who were burning people in cages and recruiting people to enter our country legally.
0.0	0.353406106587	And it's especially significant that they are working with both Turkey and Greece in order to do this.
0.0	0.303204240781	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.276134096474	As we speak, there are new problems on the horizon.
0.0	0.492461171428	Here's why, the president of the United States and both his attorney's general, they give the benefit of the doubt to the criminal, not to the police officers.
0.0	0.356363215477	We elected a president that is weakening America on the global stage.
0.0	0.112164488796	We need to stop that.
0.0	0.315934192363	That's real moral authority that we need in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.448964264948	So we have no disagreement about the need to buttress Social Security, get more revenue into the program.
0.0	0.33441695362	You know, I sat down with the senior leadership of John Deere.
0.0	0.35486000572	These attack ads are going to be part of life.
0.0	0.348145920019	And every single income decile sees a double-digit increase in after-tax income.
0.0	0.0915189384371	I love Donald Trump.
0.0	0.53608033089	And what I have concluded is that the best policy is to get rid of all government subsidies, and get the government out of our lives, and let people rise and fall based on how good they are.
0.0	0.336144037447	Senator Cruz is precisely right.
0.0	0.0061669607688	No, he doesn't.
0.0	0.476974274686	People are being released from jail without the education, without the job training, without the resources that they need to get their lives together, then they end up -- we're shocked that they end up back in jail again.
0.0	0.274406875421	Number -- and that is important for you to know.
0.0	0.345522193956	You know, you had Herbert Hoover before that saying, no, we got to only worry about the deficit.
0.0	0.434024348612	I was the chairman of the National Commission on Homeland Security and Terrorism for the United States for five years.
0.0	0.241834998039	Let me just say this.
0.0	0.205219204356	So what if children are going hungry?
0.0	0.373245789681	She is still defending Planned Parenthood, and she is still her party's frontrunner.
0.0	0.129962191252	I was a governor during the 9/11 attack.
0.0	0.226056252267	I actually have a plan.
0.0	0.240246405301	I will stand firm.

0.0	0.254223658668	I would say that I would and I have a permit, which is very unusual in New York -- a permit to carry.
0.0	0.252576683235	What we need to do is destroy their ability to attack us here over there, and then get out.
0.0	0.452665162083	Heck, find me a Republican in Congress that would cut spending ten dollars.
0.0	0.5	If elected president, I will do everything I can to expand Social Security benefits, not just for seniors, but for disabled veterans, as well.
0.0	0.352981408203	We need to get back in the game as it relates to our Arab nations.
0.0	0.194155759434	You know, I find it really quite fascinating some of the president's proclamations.
0.0	0.312019753599	So this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle.
0.0	0.0617974160331	But the poll numbers have.
0.0	0.197130305063	The only way we're going to solve this problem is with we, the people.
0.0	0.113390237439	I know this, I certainly am.
0.0	0.410935912781	I am a little skeptical about your governor actually caring enough about higher education to make any kind of commitment like that.
0.0	0.107747412173	You gotta be -- stick with it, and all that.
0.0	0.366470529759	I think there's a sense in this country today that somehow our best days are behind us.
0.0	0.214548125999	And, the fact is, none of them.
0.0	0.134404028805	We're up 347,000 jobs.
0.0	0.34244419608	What I said was I don't believe that I would be president of the United States and have the same dysfunction that exists in Washington, D.C. now.
0.0	0.21723468359	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.451135280098	I think Americans want someone to have a track record of showing them how to get this country back on record, someone who will stand up and every day project that best days of America are in front of us.
0.0	0.400535727952	I stood yesterday with 75 construction workers.
0.0	0.453074705839	So I not only had the opportunity to go through the Cold War struggles in Central America, and even after 9/11 to be involved.
0.0	0.371896766906	And the same goes for overseas, where we have to put together a coalition of Muslim nations.
0.0	0.227311272226	Make our streets safe again.
0.0	0.470826214046	There is one major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people.
1.0	0.99168888073	We do what the American people want, to expand Social Security by $1,300 a year for people under $16,000, and we extend the life of Social Security for 58 years.
0.0	0.107717637696	Yeah, he said everybody.
0.0	0.111871607872	The answer is yes.
0.0	0.258344541615	America is back in the leadership business.
0.0	0.4839109505	Last I heard, a United States senator had the right to disagree with the president, including a president who has done such an extraordinary job.
0.0	0.402597748883	Now, the challenge we're seeing today is that the Supreme Court is being converted into some type of political body.
0.0	0.378128503247	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.202746084613	It's like a tariff, but here's the difference: if we impose a tariff, China responds.
0.0	0.401353148813	In this particular moment of serious crises, saying to the American people don't give up on the political process.
0.0	0.340402529978	I think he means somebody who hasn't been a career politician, and who's been out of office for awhile.
0.0	0.0173099912411	But look...
0.0	0.12032285113	But, you know what we're not telling them?
0.0	0.422429974637	What we need to do is take the rest of the federal entitlements, not just welfare, but food stamps and Medicaid and housing programs and do the same thing we did with welfare.
0.0	0.258020052203	The question was, would you meet with an adversary without conditions?
0.0	0.144449113867	And then what he did is redefine the role of government.
0.0	0.550348150876	But I'd sign a second one, as I did in New York, as well, having a hard hiring freeze on adding new employees except for the military or defense-related positions.
0.0	0.252201405275	We need to have stronger families.
0.0	0.421839449731	Imagine a country where the middle class can get rising income again.
0.0	0.307339028272	And just so -- if I could, because he insulted a lot of people.
0.0	0.225610634136	One thing I want to be clear about tonight.
0.0	0.277106290216	Secondly, a policy on recruiting and hiring, and then more resources for -- for training.
0.0	0.209710306847	If an American missionary has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.377844085826	And, it was made for we the people, we are the ones who decide who we are, and we should never give away the values and principles that made America into a great nation for the sake of political correctness.
0.0	0.218423488291	You know, Hillary Clinton's always saying how Republicans don't follow science?
0.0	0.262118889575	Now, Bill, he loves to criticize America, apologize for us, criticize medieval Christians.
0.0	0.229771436333	But the facts and the law here are really quite clear.
0.0	0.173586452562	(APPLAUSE) This is not a cage match.
0.0	0.36670951544	I think what our campaign is indicating is that the American people are tired of establishment politics, tired of establishment economics.
0.0	0.219152934373	They're devaluing their currency and they're killing our companies.
0.0	0.263515947867	Well, let me just -- let me just say, once again...
0.0	0.48347181625	And clearly, what we need to do is get a group of experts together, including people from other countries, some of our friends from Israel, who have had experience screening these people and come up with new guidelines for immigration, and for visas, for people who are coming into this country.
0.0	0.381863877386	...incentives for people to keep people healthy, rather than giving the incentives to treat them when they're sick?
0.0	0.438335145997	The FCC jumping in now and saying, "we're going to put 400 pages of regulation over the Internet," is going to create massive problems.
1.0	0.974473953293	Ronald Regan opposed the value tax because he said it was a way to blindfold the people, so the true cost of government was not there there for them.
0.0	0.428142377109	They know that this country is pushing the middle class, the hardworking taxpayers, backwards, and they saw a president who doesn't understand their pain, and doesn't have any plan for getting away from it.
0.0	0.41773555781	A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to go on a congressional delegation.
0.0	0.390014902539	You will also have to means-test the benefits and declare there's not enough money.
0.0	0.313122516966	I went out and said, it's ridiculous.
0.0	0.313541543591	Every time we send signals like this, we send a signal of weakness, not strength.
0.0	0.320992853584	Why should we let their people be sitting there smoking their cigars, sitting in their comfortable chairs in Raqqa?
0.0	0.371288695077	And I believe people need a leader who is prepared to make tough calls in tough times and stand up...
0.0	0.751813079593	I was not at all.
0.0	0.291079337179	No Jeb, I don't remember -- well, let me tell you.
0.0	0.126455377562	Look, we have to stop with political correctness.
0.0	0.0908161704184	... and I'll tell you why.
0.0	0.560772860552	...is the lowest personal rate any candidate up here has, and what it would also enable us to do is for every citizen to fill out their taxes on a postcard so we can eliminate the IRS.
0.0	0.192385676968	We went after companies that were ripping off shareholders.
0.0	0.203529429196	I will put a price tag.
0.0	0.401747284088	You know, some of these -- these engagement rules that the administration has -- "we're not going to bomb a tanker that's coming out of there because there might be a person in it" -- give me a break.
0.0	0.219062889326	I believe in the PTT because it's important those countries in Asia are interfacing against China.
0.0	0.0417508702805	I think we should do both.
0.0	0.215691687313	Do senators have the right to disagree with the president?
0.0	0.00280881569458	Thank you.
0.0	0.0700900048592	Why didn't they call?
0.0	0.154497182631	There have been some good recommendations about what needs to happen.
0.0	0.392229319938	Let's quit blaming the people on Social Security.
0.0	0.0224435017621	It's not that hard.
0.0	0.476936247723	We have $2.5 trillion outside of the United States which we want to bring back in.
0.0	0.415000454204	We need leadership, someone who has a backbone and sticks with things, rather than just talks about them as though anything matters when you're talking about amendments that don't even actually are part of a bill that ever passed.
0.0	0.296631260459	I know we can do this because we're still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
1.0	0.9692259982	In the past he has called him weak.
0.0	0.286980706743	People are upset about it.
0.0	0.0617124026328	Japan, the same thing.
0.0	0.279797488419	We're nowhere close to a balanced budget or fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.320096696495	My tax plan enables you to fill out your taxes on a postcard so we can abolish the IRS.
0.0	0.543043112932	I want to speak to all the moms and dads whose sons and daughters are fighting for this country, and the incredible sense of betrayal when you have a commander-in-chief who will not even speak the name of our enemy, radical Islamic terrorism, when you have a commander-in- chief who sends $150 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, who's responsible for murdering hundreds of our servicemen and women.
0.0	0.430899028025	In that State of the Union, President Obama didn't so much as mention the 10 sailors that had been captured by Iran.
0.0	0.0797897665341	But we stuck to our message.
0.0	0.0188486116224	Neil...
0.0	0.420857452043	And when you have insider information, which apparently has been the case, where people use that information and use big data to try to take advantage of it, there has to be some regulation.
0.0	0.438656964201	Well, it's not a matter of what the first executive order would be, Bill.
0.0	0.394302071438	We have to protect our 2nd amendment and you cannot do this and certainly what Barack Obama was doing with the executive order.
0.0	0.1223477415	My sister was a single mom, both of my aunts who were a single moms.
0.0	0.0635102314151	Everybody knows that.
0.0	0.0819876104673	That's not right.
0.0	0.0708118554904	How are we going to do this?
0.0	0.335742659639	-- work better to lift everyone up, men and women.
0.0	0.0762377026503	Because it wouldn't work.
0.0	0.0536578078663	It's peanuts.
0.0	0.200599719215	We need a president who can solve our problems, bring us together.
0.0	0.476271415735	What we have got to do is make it clear that any police officer who breaks the law will, in fact, be held accountable.
0.0	0.15069313408	And so do I.
0.0	0.252088544635	The only way we're going to defund Planned Parenthood is have a pro-life president.
0.0	0.42698291392	I would hope that we could all agree that we are sick and tired of seeing videos on television of unarmed people, often African-Americans, shot by police officers.
0.0	0.373891189344	The president wants to do things without working with his Congress, without working with the legislature, and without getting the consent of the American people.
0.0	0.370506241731	You'll see me on the floor of the Senate tomorrow filibustering this and saying enough is enough, no more debt.
0.0	0.198163793141	Does he stand up for law enforcement?
0.0	0.472272631666	I agree with President Obama who used executive orders to protect families because the Congress, the House was unable or refused to act.
0.0	0.522328544718	And the last line standing between them and our families might be us and a gun.
0.0	0.0487376080745	He's wrong.
0.0	0.378762143139	And aligned with a corrupt campaign finance system is a rigged economy.
0.0	0.388217316865	And you look around, and you see what's happening, and this is not the case when he introduced the doctor -- very nice, everything perfect but that is not representative of what you have in that line of migration.
0.0	0.432373681371	When the Social Security program was started in the 1930s, not very many women worked.
0.0	0.201438001717	Yes, they've got to get out of Syria.
0.0	0.461818322733	Why not go to Congress and in a bipartisan way, begin to deal with the process of mental health issues so that people that are spiraling out of control because of mental health challenges don't have access to guns.
0.0	0.3516487376	But the good news is the next commander-in-chief is standing on this stage.
0.0	0.0949774247365	Republicans and Democrats alike believe this.
0.0	0.26200501593	And secondly, we should pass the legislation that I've introduced...
0.0	0.027217907281	OK.
0.0	0.06157618649	That's for sure.
1.0	0.992719893018	We're spending $80 billion a year locking up fellow Americans.
0.0	0.367042854037	I voted against the war in Iraq because I listened very carefully to what President Bush and Vice President Cheney had to say and I didn't believe them.
0.0	0.0244696213351	So I would -- I would be willing to do that.
0.0	0.197188256594	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.333117826982	I've a bill to fix Social Security.
0.0	0.260681151211	Obamacare, we're going to repeal it and replace it.
0.0	0.154947777655	And by those standards, we're not doing particularly well.
0.0	0.219752821077	Here's the bottom line, and I'll close with this.
0.0	0.377217905669	And we finally need to tackle the basics to cut this government down to size and hold it accountable.
0.0	0.311029366156	... no, you already had your chance, Marco, and you blew it.
0.0	0.515394858048	And we fought for statewide school choice, where the dollars follow the child, instead of the child following the dollars.
0.0	0.281787463939	Marco leaves the IRS code in with all of the complexity.
0.0	0.274558918201	Since he brought me up, do I not get to respond?
0.0	0.105666829065	in particular.
0.0	0.397967940434	You can't get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year.
0.0	0.381592298606	I believe that it's most important that we unleash the full potential of women and girls in our society.
0.0	0.275101982748	I am a conservative; I can win this job, I can do this job, I need your help, I need your support.
0.0	0.544247734057	Change the Mexico City policy, not take one dime of taxpayer money to fund abortion organizations overseas, and restore the NSA that's been gutted.
0.0	0.460930386369	Now, the fact is, what this president has done is invited Russia to play an even bigger role, bring in Vladimir Putin to negotiate getting those chemical weapons back from Assad, yet what do we have today?
0.0	0.309523310936	But we need to understand that American Muslims are on the front line of our defense.
0.0	0.352828157466	Focus on the diseases that are costing us the trillions of dollars.
0.0	0.405324991378	Well, you know, I think, from a historical point of view, somebody with my background, somebody with my views, somebody who has spent his entire life taking on the big money interests, I think a Sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment, as well.
0.0	0.455561650323	The better way of dealing with this -- the better way of dealing with this is recognizing that there are people in, you know, the -- Islamic terrorists inside, embedded in refugee populations.
0.0	0.16394482266	All right, look, this has been a great debate.
0.0	0.302811177012	That makes the world less peaceful, less safe.
0.0	0.507221405881	I can see why people are angry and scared, because this president has created a condition where our national security has weakened dramatically.
0.0	0.0512100065195	Your prosecute criminals.
0.0	0.0882191829325	He wasn't my senator.
0.0	0.371638582681	The final observation, invoked Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.252711527593	And I'll tell you, I'm not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump.
0.0	0.131521739167	...Then I'll buy you a tequila...
0.0	0.224726405682	Yes, our allies are not perfect.
0.0	0.226449425908	You've got to give people hope.
0.0	0.182783702436	I think we should be for free trade but I think fair trade.
0.0	0.299248637934	Our job has to be to recognize the conflict between the two.
0.0	0.751813079593	And why?
0.0	0.408126155195	So I'm going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of Americans fulfilling their potential, because I don't think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single American to live up to theirs.
0.0	0.461075456049	The biggest tax increase happened under the watch of Barack Obama, and spending's gone up.
0.0	0.458362597453	Now, I for seven years was the U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.0819876104673	That's right.
0.0	0.0423794736125	That's what we need.
0.0	0.195203938591	We know this for a fact.
0.0	0.0176087338041	Yeah.
0.0	0.123664263721	And you know, he's right.
0.0	0.0252261980625	... on Larry Tribe.
0.0	0.25365298818	is exactly the leadership we need in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.24951556634	Is there an area for a safety net?
0.0	0.189837872604	If I have a weakness, it's that I try to live by the rules.
0.0	0.087432176891	I'm going to do it for America.
0.0	0.31854426995	But if that's the best the New York Times has got, they better go back to the well.
0.0	0.288410987943	So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.3278045192	It is hard to find someone in my generation that thinks Social Security will be there for us.
0.0	0.0826100739998	We lose on trade.
0.0	0.257716640307	Maria, I'd just like to say...
0.0	0.306091984517	In terms of 2007 immigration reform, yeah, I did vote against it.
0.0	0.459347248339	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.061658811062	You know why?
0.0	0.4896519976	I will cut this government down to size and hold it accountable, simplify the tax code, roll back the regulations that have been spewing out of Washington, D.C. for 50 years.
0.0	0.201708874175	I strongly support the president's executive actions.
0.0	0.217271185778	This deal in Washington is an example of why Washington's broken.
0.0	0.0487376080745	We were wrong.
0.0	0.399759818802	My point is this: I won two landslide elections, I made big changes.
1.0	0.986945248407	Let's not have the most expensive business tax rate in the world.
0.0	0.374288690177	We have to provide the NATO support to back up the mission that is going on.
0.0	0.353142655063	So we have a good group of people.
0.0	0.44635423291	And what I think all of us are saying is, our monetary policy, our tax policy, regulatory policy needs to be radically changed so we can create high sustained growth for income to rise.
0.0	0.389222923113	So, are we going to ban Muslims from India, from Indonesia, from countries that are strong allies -- that we need to build better relationships with?
0.0	0.298915041504	But I feel that the gun-free zones and, you know, when you say that, that's target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill. That's target.
0.0	0.314589435477	Did any of you get a phone call from Bill Clinton?
0.0	0.249500060614	So why are the pharmaceutical companies consolidating?
0.0	0.398237091949	I may not be your dream candidate just yet, but I can assure you I am Hillary Clinton's worst nightmare.
0.0	0.360041944816	And they must be part of our coalition to destroy ISIS and I believe we can get that done.
0.0	0.225683555966	You know, everyone here talks about the need to take on Washington.
0.0	0.276587866011	When I was in Washington, I fought to get the budget balanced.
0.0	0.124567507256	I just left Indonesia -- bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb.
0.0	0.208026353643	We pay federal taxes.
0.0	0.199689653583	In fact, he's done worse than nothing.
0.0	0.506403548149	The first one would be to my good friend, Bibi Netanyahu, to reassure him we will stand with the State of Israel.
0.0	0.16043686187	John Harwood, there's a bigger issue here.
0.0	0.313209769515	We also want to dominate this from a commercial side.
0.0	0.120769672306	That's not the role of the government.
0.0	0.286301267595	Most importantly, I think I understand leadership, which sometimes requires a tough call in a tough time.
0.0	0.214594007657	They're going to end up in the productive economy, which is where we want them.
0.0	0.335969329945	But we allowed people to keep health care.
0.0	0.368443249369	You know, I have said -- I have said many times, you know, I'm not asking people to support me because I'm a woman.
0.0	0.0845848784394	The domino theory, you know, if Vietnam goes, China, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.
0.0	0.124940296156	You gotta be creative and imaginative.
0.0	0.206395780007	We need to reform Social Security.
0.0	0.377839051238	And I feel very strongly that I have an agenda, I have a record that really does respond to a lot of the specific needs that the women in our country face.

0.0	0.36462494884	Atlantic City has gone bad.
0.0	0.280042756182	We need a nominee who is going to throw every punch, not pull punches, and someone who cannot stumble before he even gets into the ring.
0.0	0.138592903094	My name was mentioned.
0.0	0.425664701131	Senator Sanders, from a debate in 2008, quote what I said.
0.0	0.226946085023	I believe in it but we have to be smart and we have to use smart people to negotiate.
0.0	0.437112122419	It's a simple formula: common sense regulations, which is why I think we should freeze all federal regulations for one year, except for health and safety.
0.0	0.307110976308	Now, what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next.
0.0	0.4282937036	And the people who are often the most hard-hit are widows, because when their spouse dies, they can lose up to one-half of their Social Security monthly payment.

0.0	0.226355458676	If you'll answer the (inaudible) core question.
0.0	0.413363818279	Well, if that's the case, we're going to win every state, if Bernie Sanders is the nominee.

0.0	0.0594167739131	I think if it doesn't...
0.0	0.404136262473	Well, first let me address the tax issue because it's related to the entitlement issue and I want to thank you for holding a substantive debates where we can have debates about these key issues on taxes.
0.0	0.247524515513	I would choose Nelson Mandela for his generosity of heart, his understanding of the need for reconciliation.
0.0	0.258973641663	Look, I think we are readier than we used to be, but it's a constant effort that has to be undertaken to make sure we are as ready as we need to be.
0.0	0.751813079593	Not -- not on that, no.
0.0	0.492657373634	When extraordinarily wealthy people make very large contributions to Super PACs, and in many cases in this campaign, Super PACs have raised more money than individual candidates have, OK?
0.0	0.435628156224	Today, many of us picked up our newspapers, and we were horrified to see the sight of 10 American sailors on their knees, with their hands on their heads.
0.0	0.367134472426	Americans are tired of hearing this debate -- want to go to, what are you going to do about illegal immigration?
0.0	0.0322428267223	I will do that.
0.0	0.266898926489	Because I think we have to get to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.18246298625	So I'm going to come up with the best way forward.
0.0	0.409323331093	I've spent a lifetime in politics fighting the Clinton machine.
0.0	0.377699811611	First thing I'd tell the American people, whatever it takes to defend our nation, I would do.
0.0	0.207237131872	Don't vote for me if you want to keep the gridlock in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.516631637017	So it's not just the government -- the private sector companies, it's also our own government that needs to raise the level of our game.
0.0	0.536959016247	Mine is the only plan that saves over $1 trillion and that's why I'm answering your question.
0.0	0.429813665821	In my view healthcare is a right of all people, not a privilege, and I will fight for that.
0.0	0.249372139767	We have to provide financial support to them.
0.0	0.416469298307	Yeah, again, as I said, we're raising a family in the 21st century and it's one of the reasons why my tax plan is a pro- family tax plan.
0.0	0.337827858403	Eleven points, to be exact.
0.0	0.261476842071	The truth is this, the big problem, we need a leader in Washington who understands how to get something done, not to talk about it, not to propose it, to get it done.
0.0	0.403163059181	It's the only way to level the playing field between big and powerful and small and powerless.
0.0	0.254494126238	They're a feeding frenzy for sick people.
0.0	0.484327143792	Under my plan, no business, big or small, will pay more than 25 percent flat rate on their business income.
0.0	0.357518080217	It was an investment bank, Lehman Brothers, that contributed to our collapse.
0.0	0.442926110601	Why, for the life of me, I do not understand why did we stop doing vocational education in America, people that can work with their hands; people you can train to do this work while they're still in high school so they can graduate ready to go work.
0.0	0.265475041111	And I have set forth a compact that would do just that for debt-free tuition.
0.0	0.400413434872	I have yet to see a proposal that you're describing that the -- raising the cap would apply to passive income.
0.0	0.194423272845	There are many lawyers.
0.0	0.373764979492	And some of them, I will say, not all, have called me and said, "Donald, thank you very much; you're exposing an unbelievable problem and we have to get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.141804596649	Neil, I was mentioned too.
0.0	0.353727569729	Somebody who is very fond of the president, agrees with him most of the time, I disagree with his recent deportation policies.
0.0	0.191798528979	Here's the deal, Chris is totally right.
0.0	0.182952938162	But you know, here's the real issue, is this America anymore?
0.0	0.247644951664	Not keeping the government open.
0.0	0.318977534948	We're a country of laws, not of men, not of people who do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.270774741191	Helping business make profits.
0.0	0.321854640403	And Bernie Sanders will tell them that it's because of the rich.
0.0	0.399438916221	So let's support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition.
0.0	0.140019901776	Reforms, everything from moral and cultural issues to economic issues.
0.0	0.0788617728762	They do whatever what they do, OK.
0.0	0.751813079593	No.
0.0	0.17008682857	You know what he said to me?
0.0	0.263566852743	OK, just so you understand -- I know so much about trading about with China.
0.0	0.242662881185	And when we talk about Wall Street, let's talk about Wall Street.
0.0	0.16603908031	And Carl -- Carl, I'm not finished yet.
0.0	0.488589121378	I'm saying, absolutely, we don't have to continue to lose 505 billion dollars as a trade deficit for the privilege of dealing with China.
0.0	0.256151456088	The matter is what orders exist now that shouldn't exist?
0.0	0.263218978306	I try to live by the rules, no matter what they are, and I was brought up that way as a kid.
0.0	0.266917233283	The second will be to the supreme leader of Iran.
0.0	0.0637068612503	And that is what they told me when I was in Jordan in November.
0.0	0.130844789055	Those are the hard numbers.
0.0	0.184717286867	And that's why we must make sure we continue to frack.
0.0	0.343182166354	But if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in Flint.
0.0	0.269652931947	It was a coalition made up of Arabs and Americans and westerners and we're going to need it again.
0.0	0.270564549513	We need to embed with -- with the Iraqi military.
0.0	0.415646355439	Let us actually go to zero- based budgeting so we know where the money is being spent.
0.0	0.190886692428	We hear actually a lot of good intentions.
0.0	0.252594161336	I voted for comprehensive immigration reform in 2007.
0.0	0.283233181587	And secondly, when you talk about me being on the board of Lehman Brothers, I wasn't on the board of Lehman Brothers.
0.0	0.303413048093	We have a budget closer to $3.5 trillion.
0.0	0.303458929966	He's been a good governor, and he's a heck of a lot better than his predecessor that would have bankrupted New Jersey.
0.0	0.50522255313	I have a proven record of success, 32 years in business, and 8 years as Governor of the state of Florida.
0.0	0.422537854651	... that he tried to take credit for four years later.
0.0	0.447071199149	I've got a proven record fighting to defend the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.132103511851	They're tough, they're strong, they're great people.
0.0	0.396401587349	And we got to fight like crazy so people can think the American dream still exists, because it does, with rising wages, with full employment and with everybody in America -- and I mean everybody in America -- having an opportunity to realize the American dream of having a better life than their mother and their father.
0.0	0.329489011502	And there's a reason why Hillary's supporters are echoing Donald's attacks on me, because Hillary...
0.0	0.370420272235	I think, though, government is too big now.
0.0	0.486606676686	I cut the bureaucracy down to size, re-introduced accountability, focused on service, on innovation, on leading in every market, in every product segment.
0.0	0.252391478756	Maybe we would've gotten a deal where we didn't give everything away.
0.0	0.00414468352848	...Chris...
0.0	0.477811940132	Do you remember when he ran for president of the United States, and he was a candidate, and he went and said, "These Americans with traditional values, they are bitter people, and they cling to their guns and to their religion."
0.0	0.253114109699	I think he's tapped into an anger that people feel.
0.0	0.413106277082	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.0353659655669	We need Jordan.
0.0	0.353642078786	And I'll go back to something that had been mentioned just a few minutes ago.
0.0	0.314711779638	In my world, we'll focus on energy independence and a clean environment.
0.0	0.264809107092	That's essentially what we have now, and we don't need that.
0.0	0.347525825225	This country is running out of time.
0.0	0.282304567932	I mean, let me be honest with the people who are watching at home.
1.0	0.583984322233	And by the way, when I left, there were over 1 million fewer people on welfare in New York state than when I took office...
0.0	0.317129649432	I'm going to prioritize those recipients who need the most help first.
0.0	0.362636206452	But the average person takes out about $350,000.
0.0	0.289277082387	So, I'm proud of Senator Sanders, and his supporters.
0.0	0.478049479451	When I am president, I will work consistently every single day to keep this country safe, not call Edward Snowden, as you did, a great public servant.
0.0	0.198067753996	Or would you rather take less later on?
0.0	0.352108831362	These mythical Arab armies that my friends talk about that are going to protect us don't exist.
0.0	0.108469167501	America's at a crossroads.
0.0	0.231212460617	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.311373902017	My heart has not changed, because I've always been appalled by abortion.
0.0	0.224935781988	I will show you what they do to women.
0.0	0.239623938999	Oh, well, you know, it just didn't work out for you.
0.0	0.344491611807	Iran sanctions -- the Iran sanctions that brought them to the table, those are sanctions that we put in place when I was in the United States Senate, and a whole host of other things that put me in a position of saying, I not only have a great vision, but I can govern effectively in Washington.
0.0	0.161298767802	And we can no longer continue to sweep it under the rug.
0.0	0.461335424722	And you put me on that stage against her next September, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.213628844551	We need somebody who can lead.
0.0	0.272357421391	We're going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education.
0.0	0.266664357802	This is a business flat tax.
0.0	0.43229664313	But I think a pause on Syrian refugees has been exactly right for all the governors that have called for it, and also, of course, for me as the governor of Ohio.
0.0	0.393570105338	23 million files in the hands of the Chinese?
0.0	0.433043784821	Friends of mine are ordering Kamatsu (ph) tractors now because they've de-valued the yen to such an extent that you can't buy a Caterpillar tractor.
0.0	0.366456217067	I've done it once in Washington, with great jobs and lower taxes.
0.0	0.171330539538	And I could say, oh, I'm not angry.
0.0	0.449450642453	We have talked about tax reform in every single election for decades.
0.0	0.176889238152	That's not the America that I've ever known.
0.0	0.197125206927	And I would not stand for that as president of the United States.
0.0	0.317408094159	Actually going to do something to help the American worker.
0.0	0.357152236145	I think it is fair to say, whatever the complaints that you want to make about him are, that with respect to China, one of the most challenging relationships we have, his opening up China and his ongoing relationships with the leaders of China is an incredibly useful relationship for the United States of America.
0.0	0.332826548826	Well, one of us ran against Barack Obama.
0.0	0.560158020174	So when you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration -- which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother -- clearly, we are looking at institutional racism.
1.0	0.0917697804241	It got stolen from them.
0.0	0.426351537765	I would give up some Social Security to save a system that Americans are going to depend on now and in the future.
0.0	0.387992087652	Well, Secretary Clinton, you're not in the White House yet.
0.0	0.313154256021	This president and John Kerry and Hillary Clinton all have made it harder for the next president to act, but he must act to confront the ambitions of Iran.
0.0	0.479704641929	Look, I am deeply concerned about what's happening in every community in America, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths.
0.0	0.286968041856	We're going to start the process of securing that border.
0.0	0.149831110517	But they can't get along.
0.0	0.159236074967	I will tell you that.
0.0	0.266978318868	It's like them getting mugged, and then us saying, well, we're going to mug you some more.
0.0	0.182562868141	We both want to get more revenue in.
0.0	0.276553565386	Sometimes you win a war by killing murderous, evil terrorists.
0.0	0.366190337015	Let's let a Justice Department -- and I will make an attorney general who will enforce the law and make justice more than just a word.
0.0	0.385279208226	Thirdly, we need to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to send a serious signal that we're back in the game with Israel --
0.0	0.120153822532	And for good cause.
0.0	0.342597892261	A lot has happened in nine months.
0.0	0.0104731616092	She was naturalized.
1.0	0.985705599808	A vat is imposed as a sales tax when you buy a good.
0.0	0.159129404	He's penalized -- and doesn't understand.
0.0	0.191373734186	If I'm president, there won't be stupid deals anymore.
0.0	0.465107648665	So what I will tell you about our incentives -- our incentives are tight, and at the end of the day we make sure that we gain more from the creation of jobs than what we lose.
0.0	0.273619146386	Who can you count on to keep us safer, stronger and freer?
0.0	0.648137665814	Now, Secretary Clinton's Super PAC, as I understand it, received $25 million dollars last reporting period, $15 million dollars from Wall Street.
0.0	0.0207172117678	With all the candidates, why me?
0.0	0.0912556831401	Oh, I'll talk about that, too.
0.0	0.424784737947	And the people who are getting hammered are small businesses, it's single moms, it's Hispanics.
0.0	0.333542681519	Because, I've got to tell you the truth, even in New Jersey what you're doing is called rude.
0.0	0.562342539038	Now in terms of their really stunning hit piece, what they mentioned is when I was running for senate -- unlike Hillary Clinton, I don't have masses of money in the bank, hundreds of millions of dollars.
0.0	0.384029632886	Well, to start with, unlike President Obama, I'll actually name the enemy that we confront.
0.0	0.211120582929	I'm not blaming Chris, by the way, but he will know about that.
0.0	0.351170088589	Martha, religious liberty doesn't include encouraging a fellow American to engage in violent jihad and kill an American here.
0.0	0.306485553048	They can solve the problem of North Korea if they wanted to but they taunt us.
0.0	0.270700525824	The big Internet companies.
0.0	0.288626459268	When you head back to airport tonight, go check and see what the...
0.0	0.410276487476	In her world, cap- and-trade would dominate, that we will destroy the economy in the name of helping the environment.
0.0	0.232314843457	And as a result of that, the shah of Iran came in, terrible dictator.
0.0	0.148395063255	Well, you know what?
0.0	0.177672353294	I've got five grandkids.
0.0	0.386271441022	Now, I'm the only person that's put out a detailed plan on how to deal with entitlements.
0.0	0.186214585853	And that's just not acceptable.
1.0	0.987303345269	You used to say that you were in favor of birthright citizenship, now you say that you are against it.
0.0	0.227219575918	But I think to suggest that I have voiced criticism, this blurb that you talk about, you know what the blurb said?
0.0	0.128728984314	You've got a bit of experience, I would imagine.
1.0	0.410936303275	And we'll save a trillion dollars over the next 10 years.
0.0	0.528174512649	And I spent my entire lifetime balancing federal budgets, growing jobs, the same in Ohio.
0.0	0.385760729594	It was never intended that the government should be in every aspect of our lives.
0.0	0.275673248107	So you know the New York Times and I don't have exactly have the warmest of relationships.
0.0	0.577571412102	But the greatest gains, percentage-wise, for people, are gonna be at the lower end of our plan, and here's why: because in addition to a general personal exemption, we are increasing the per-child tax credit for working families.
0.0	0.42463785185	I'm the only one on this stage that has a plan that would create jobs, cut taxes, balance the budget and can get it done because I'm realistic.
0.0	0.4384261673	Well, first of all, let's understand why we are even having this debate and why Donald tapped in to some of that anger that's out there about this whole issue.
0.0	0.279703627168	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.268626109726	Right there, right next to the plant.
0.0	0.376627616833	The second thing I said is we need to add reforms, not just increase the numbers, but add reforms.
0.0	0.452833699684	I go further in the plan that I've proposed, which has been called the toughest, most effective, comprehensive plan for reining in the other risks that the financial system could face.
0.0	0.0792394710944	Look, that's who I stand up for.
0.0	0.132369301524	Caesar's -- excuse me -- Caesar's, the Rolls-Royce, as you know, is in bankruptcy.
0.0	0.186710533236	I have a feeling it's going to work out, actually.
0.0	0.373386157897	We need to have some coalitions in that part of the world to go after ISIS, but we also need to send a clear message.

0.0	0.330414655393	You're talking about $2.7 trillion.
0.0	0.462936361035	And I traveled the country and learned how people made jobs.
0.0	0.208785086177	You've got to bring people together.
0.0	0.404196026536	Where basically, businesses now will have to pay a tax, both on the money they make, but they also have to pay taxes on the money that they pay their employees.
0.0	0.16671590733	And, I'll do that with the country.
0.0	0.093515220824	You know, I see a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist.
0.0	0.366720058389	Let me just say on taxes, how long have we been talking about tax reform in Washington, D.C.?
0.0	0.507306801387	But the best way to close this gap is to modernize higher education so Americans have the skills for those jobs.
0.0	0.390154612179	And I believe that not only Barney Frank, Paul Krugman, and others, have said that what I have proposed is the most effective.
0.0	0.166962259283	I am proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend.
0.0	0.211519508657	And I say that to Nikki.
0.0	0.542620297569	And you wanted to know the numbers, the Tax Foundation, which has scored every one of our plans, shows that this plan will allow the economy to generate 4.9 million jobs, to raise wages over 12 percent, and to generate 14 percent growth.
0.0	0.0325655750496	That's fine.
0.0	0.19045115932	Think back to Garland, Texas.
0.0	0.417223590178	How can we beat an enemy if our commander-in-chief doesn't have the moral honesty and clarity to say that Islam has a problem, and that problem is radical Islam, to say they've got to condemn not generic acts of violence, but the individual murderers who are committing these acts of violence.
1.0	0.592394630586	Not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama and the big government economy, the median wage for women has dropped $733.
0.0	0.027217907281	OK?
0.0	0.175974330155	That's exactly what we saw.
1.0	0.994155672107	Our military is a disaster.
0.0	0.351824657788	We would still have LGBT people who get married on Saturday and get fired on Monday.
0.0	0.473252407307	Last time I was elected governor, won a record margin in my state.
0.0	0.279703627168	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.458211815581	I have worked with President Obama for the last seven years.
0.0	0.468091483067	Here's my promise, at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country.
0.0	0.453831928366	And what you're going to see in Washington this week is establishment Republicans have made an agreement with the president to raise the debt ceiling in an unlimited fashion; no limit to the debt ceiling raise.
0.0	0.301440004915	The time to act is now.
0.0	0.149672614325	But that's not an accurate description of the plan.
0.0	0.446373907507	I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators -- back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.
0.0	0.468680639895	And that's an economy where ordinary Americans are working longer hours for low wagers.
0.0	0.309487689296	The fact of the matter is we the American people are not each other's enemies, it's those people who are trying to divide us who are the enemies.
0.0	0.00895454198225	So we have a disagreement on this.
0.0	0.45866452513	If you look at the numbers, there are actually as many, if not more white communities that are truly being left behind and left out.
0.0	0.0985283131346	I think we need to be very careful with tariffs, and here's why.
0.0	0.239226412075	And Lehman Brothers started it all.
0.0	0.423548253879	And yet when he won, he turned to me, trusting my judgment, my experience, to become secretary of state.
0.0	0.366269645279	I was a person who has dealt extensively with these homeland security issues.
1.0	0.394216942475	Now, on the floor of the Congress, the Washington establishment from both parties puts forward a bill that will explode the deficit.
0.0	0.352171715739	We will invest in education, and jobs for our kids, not incarceration and more jails.
0.0	0.405498041539	And we are going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fall.
0.0	0.149073114782	They don't provide any abortions in Louisiana.
0.0	0.315043086205	But the final thing I want to say about this is the following.
0.0	0.425610400182	Had that actually -- that same columnist wrote a column comparing me to an evil demonic spirit from the move, "It Follows" that jumps apparently from body to body possessing people.
0.0	0.240842072767	That's not why I ran for office.
1.0	0.188776017921	The Oregon study showed this.
0.0	0.0144070485844	And that's what I intend to do.
1.0	0.974780850521	I'll tell you what else they're upset about: you're 50 or 51 years old, and some kid walks in and tells you you're out of work, and you don't know where to go and where to turn.
0.0	0.393354348386	You didn't see these kind of ideas being batted around, and being batted around in a way that's civil and smart and that's trying to help to inform the voter out there.
0.0	0.17519492398	I want to reverse that decline.
0.0	0.399377296964	Let me tell you that, in this country -- in this country, people are concerned about their economic future.
0.0	0.458247759416	And the people in New York fought and fought and fought, and we saw more death, and even the smell of death -- nobody understood it.
0.0	0.159001255443	Nobody can deny them.
0.0	0.132088060875	I'm proud that I gave him that advice.
0.0	0.429226646649	Now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world.
0.0	0.1674423332	It's a problem all over the world.
0.0	0.441632735734	I have created tens of thousands of jobs, and I'll be creating many millions of jobs if I'm given -- if I'm given the opportunity to be president.
0.0	0.399462701734	Some do, but many Americans are dying to have an opportunity to grow and to create something inside this economy.
0.0	0.439784178266	I like Marco too, and two years ago, he called me a conservative reformer that New Jersey needed.
0.0	0.33469852008	By the way, unlike our country where we're totally predictable and the enemy, whether it's ISIS or anybody else, they know exactly what we're doing because we have the wrong leadership.
0.0	0.205153184838	You lead and you produce results.
0.0	0.227301077736	He's a good guy, a smart guy, and he would be a heck of a lot better president than Hillary Rodham Clinton would ever be.
0.0	0.371105540145	Well, first of all the -- the plan gives people the option of -- of opting out.
0.0	0.11639367154	I'll say this.
0.0	0.149840308164	Our next president...
0.0	0.478624920485	$19 billion of tax cuts, 1.3 million jobs created.
0.0	0.486429886615	Number one, we have to create better paying jobs.
0.0	0.363236855119	Let me tell you, Donald Trump would be a president every day of the week and twice on Sunday, rather than Hillary.
0.0	0.347546087207	You know, we have a war on virtual everything -- race wars, gender wars, income wars, religious wars, age wars.
0.0	0.18353451889	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.214433365246	So don't put people in there if you don't want them bombed.
0.0	0.751813079593	No -- no...
0.0	0.526119356069	And then, after the war, this is the guy who, in fact, yes, you're right, he opened up relations with China, and now pushed various type of trade agreements, resulting in American workers losing their jobs as corporations moved to China.
0.0	0.30668508735	Remember, we have 645 federal agencies and sub-agencies.
0.0	0.23079118565	So let's set the facts straight.
1.0	0.413729773221	What Hillary Clinton's going to say, and has said before is, she wants to raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.0297689858834	He does great.
0.0	0.253941801692	Liberty thrives when government is small.
0.0	0.400218540858	We need the lawyers(ph) off the back of the war fighters.
0.0	0.405225034919	The men and women on this stage have more ideas, more experience, more common sense than every participant in the Democratic debate.
0.0	0.44516559391	And this is what we have to -- I -- I've got to tell you, when wages don't rise -- and they haven't for a lot of families for a number of years -- it's very, very difficult for them.
1.0	0.989560348896	They don't want to pay 35 percent tax on the way back.
0.0	0.410691129488	But I think this is a worldwide -- that the entire world needs to come together to deal with this horrific refugee crisis we're seeing from Syria and Afghanistan, as well.
0.0	0.21723468359	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.233765487399	Neil, Neil -- can I say one thing about this.
0.0	0.311474680684	I just don't believe that this country's days are going to be deeply -- you know, going down.
0.0	0.223380092674	Bill, here's the interesting position on this.
0.0	0.26539772269	You know, they feel like if they don't have a lobbyist, if they're not wealthy, that somehow they don't get to play.
0.0	0.27279191082	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.253418673526	Because that's what we'd get if it were Jeb -- I tell you what, we don't need that.
0.0	0.628216801669	92 percent -- 92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama's first term belonged to women.
0.0	0.156166852739	You don't want to hear the answer.
0.0	0.0350880631279	Where are you gonna clean it up?
0.0	0.00627574963473	He undermines it.
0.0	0.372310152071	And I'm going to do everything I can to address distressed communities, whether they are communities of color, whether they are white communities, whether they are in any part of our country.
0.0	0.33802493212	Ours was intended to be a citizen government.
0.0	0.362288618962	It requires tax cuts, because that sends a message to the job creators that things are headed the right way.
0.0	0.391889446047	What we have to start thinking about, as leaders, particularly in government, is what can we do for the average American?
0.0	0.327483683707	That's what they do, whether it's the San Bernardino attack or if it's these tragedies that take place, I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is.
0.0	0.29374262758	Well, if the law would change, yeah.
0.0	0.258402692496	We will work with our Sunni allies.
0.0	0.18353451889	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.374483054008	Iran is sponsoring terrorism in many parts of the world, destabilizing areas.
0.0	0.243533605971	So I have nothing at all critical of him.
0.0	0.3528177992	I'll tell them that we're going to grow the economy so that we can give people better opportunities so they don't have to rely exclusively on benefit types of programs.
0.0	0.217173010225	Government causes a problem, and then government steps in to solve the problem.
0.0	0.0982608675004	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.464996369347	So, yes, I do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white Americans -- particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have -- you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is.
0.0	0.125665833403	Judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.452970653334	But let me also tell you, one of the issues has got to be the integration of both community and police.
0.0	0.392803026639	Eradicate those and you fix Medicare and you've fixed America, its economy and you've made people's lives a heck of a lot better.
0.0	0.274546459631	And let me say this also.
0.0	0.150806692962	This will end.
0.0	0.170239579206	We will win on everything we do.
0.0	0.491677106923	Why are there five even bigger Wall Street banks now, instead of the ten we used to have on Wall Street?
0.0	0.201902255797	And together, we can solve these problems that hurt us and heal America.
0.0	0.122538931977	They're not my ideas, and I don't necessarily agree with all of them.
0.0	0.421171667725	And you don't go tell Muslim nations you want them to be part of a coalition when you have a leading candidate for president of the United States who insults their religion.

0.0	0.556086106725	I worked hard with not only federal agents but with police officers and here's the problem, sanctuary cities is part of the problem in this country.
0.0	0.389362571138	Those three things put together are going to give confidence to job creators and you will begin to see wages rise.
0.0	0.14074623933	They were paid speeches.
0.0	0.60536701332	After those four years of looking back and being prepared, the preparation to be the most powerful individual in the world requires an extraordinary amount of work: not just having been the governor of the 12th largest economy in the world, which I might add, we added 1.5 million jobs during that period of time over that 2007 through 2014 period, a period when America was going through the most deep recession it had been through since the Great Depression.
0.0	0.484247263995	And that's how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America.
0.0	0.114235401831	And here's what the economic issue is.
0.0	0.411989752379	The question always is, what works better, the private marketplace or government?
0.0	0.339851342655	Number two, this isn't me saying it.
0.0	0.23397929419	I have many friends that deal with China.
0.0	0.0197787233787	Here's the truth.
0.0	0.357000269468	The fact is -- and if for some reason he beats the rest of the field, he beats the rest of the field (inaudible).
0.0	0.169632938445	Hey look, he never had a chance.
0.0	0.241765898358	So listen, this is the difference between being a governor and a senator.
0.0	0.347371299605	They order planes, they make Boeing build their plant in China.
0.0	0.285226187585	I know a lot of Americans are angry about the economy.
0.0	0.407373451173	When I'm president of the United States, we are defending the Second Amendment, not undermining it the way Barack Obama does.
0.0	0.395195493445	Because this president has consistently underestimated the threat of ISIS.
0.0	0.247468476103	I am not a member of the political class.
0.0	0.42816644179	You know, back in September, my friend Donald said that he had had his lawyers look at this from every which way, and there was no issue there.
0.0	0.167116797376	Everybody is really doing some bad fact...
0.0	0.212713939887	And his explanation -- he said, "look, I'm from New York, that's what we believe in New York.
0.0	0.295968796568	Well, that just wasn't -- that just wasn't the fact, Senator.
0.0	0.129233813265	Of course, they would.
0.0	0.272346829065	Thanks for coming back to me, Maria.
0.0	0.142019452378	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.24438961617	And I think this has become something that needs to be looked at in terms of regulation.
0.0	0.276178752466	Let's quit making it a problem for them.
0.0	0.279530117609	Look, under President Obama and Secretary Clinton, they're working hard to change the American dream into the European nightmare.
0.0	0.363880457299	We're bringing corporate taxes down, bringing money back in, corporate inversions.
0.0	0.257351276228	I voted for Dodd-Frank, got an important amendment in it.
0.0	0.270406477954	And I ended a federal entitlement.
1.0	0.589990559621	You know, I left my medical practice and ran for office because I was concerned about an $18 trillion debt.
0.0	0.428337079085	So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States.
0.0	0.471275062354	I have proposed there be a Middle East NATO so that we can combine our allies there to stand up to Iranian expansion, and at the same time join together to begin to stop and this ISIL thing before it becomes an actual state.
0.0	0.391404733037	Judy, one area very briefly...
0.0	0.751813079593	It was the AFL-CIO.
0.0	0.3644404859	And if we capture any of them alive, they are getting a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know.
0.0	0.328424787686	I said, absolutely, you can still change the world.
0.0	0.751813079593	No.
0.0	0.136273279199	Why don't you wait in line?
0.0	0.483485059058	But a great nation like ours should not be in a position where elderly people are cutting their pills in half, where they don't have decent nutrition, where they can't heat their homes in the wintertime.
0.0	0.391721434438	Imagine a country where people are lifted out of poverty again.
0.0	0.33834703607	We can use it to break up the banks, if that's appropriate.
0.0	0.270287167956	I know every one.
0.0	0.382043112962	I'm putting up 100 percent of my own money.
0.0	0.415186887346	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.394540618819	And second, the international crisis we are facing is most dreadful and most dangerous.
0.0	0.128449816351	That's the end of the conversation.
0.0	0.363713707873	The business flat tax, they already impose their taxes on us, so there's no reciprocal...
0.0	0.46244765815	Secretary Clinton has been going around the country saying Bernie Sanders wants to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, people are going to lose their MedicAid, they're going to lose their CHIP program.
0.0	0.138000769446	You have to ban radical Islamic jihadists.
0.0	0.477914458611	Probably in terms of the applying for the job of president, a weakness would be not really seeing myself in that position until hundreds of thousands of people began to tell me that I needed to do it.
0.0	0.14681668481	Well, I'm glad you asked that, Maria.
0.0	0.380097860254	The simple fact is that the plane that's being build here is being sold to China.
0.0	0.21969099115	We have a serious problem with, as you know, with radical Islam.
0.0	0.280118999375	This campaign is not just about electing a president.
0.0	0.149615394285	The fact is, the reason why...
0.0	0.0604276837476	..."diabetes, heart disease, cancer and Alzheimer's?"
0.0	0.252215658659	I asked my dad after -- obviously, when I found out about this.
0.0	0.0920969860641	And that was the state of Texas.
0.0	0.383464701459	First and foremost, this issue has to be now more than anything else about keeping America safe.
0.0	0.529895110983	Doesn't hurt rich people if their bar of soap goes up ten cents, but it hurts the poor and the middle class.
0.0	0.036511685849	Okay.
0.0	0.059212623626	I'll talk to them.
0.0	0.492505070799	Well, first of all, I didn't say that the rate would be 10 percent.
0.0	0.337841745052	But I agree with Jeb, you can't just do this by growing the economy.
1.0	0.988253442838	That's wrong.
0.0	0.185773769702	Wait a minute, who in their 16th month?
0.0	0.241339725144	You know, I want to go back for a moment to what we were just talking about.
0.0	0.177069464235	I understand we can disagree on the path forward.
0.0	0.278862712069	I mean, that's just the bottom line.
0.0	0.27992130008	When it comes to ISIS, we will not weaken them, we will not degrade them, we will utterly and completely destroy ISIS
0.0	0.4321513907	Yes, I thought about running four years ago.
0.0	0.212308075196	... you're not going to have peace in Syria with Assad in charge.
0.0	0.096150940239	We have a tremendous problem.
0.0	0.104487272891	And, folks, we will.
0.0	0.564660572464	Just last week, we see saw two Iraqi refugees vetted using the same process the president says will work, that were arrested for being alleged ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.301071602775	We are lowering taxes on small business.
0.0	0.272953469426	This mandatory sentencing, a very bad idea.
0.0	0.432814533457	I am convinced because I see how he works with his attorney general, not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.314884807925	Obama broke every rule of negotiation.
0.0	0.0981741202705	The answer is simple.
0.0	0.355632786961	So I think the better approach, the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against China economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage Barack Obama is doing to this economy.
0.0	0.231212460617	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.224266193754	It's why you see the pharmaceuticals getting together.
0.0	0.00280881569458	Thank you.
0.0	0.284758140817	So we do as the United States have to support our friends, our allies in Europe.
0.0	0.0671641583826	I'm aware of that.
0.0	0.252248509337	But you know, we don't want to put everybody in the same category.
0.0	0.267725068428	And by the way, I hope we can end the trade embargo with Cuba as well.
0.0	0.308263331103	So look, in foreign policy -- in foreign policy, it's strength, but you've got to be cool.
0.0	0.0471281506294	And God bless America.
0.0	0.179043383223	Here's the way you need to deal with it.
0.0	0.192199143426	Now, Donald...
0.0	0.0552860131359	That's good.
0.0	0.489244254735	The B-52 is still operational as the long range bomber; it was inaugurated in the age of Harry Truman.
0.0	0.070439876869	We haven't done so.
0.0	0.278724962912	And kind of -- that's what I see our campaign is about right now.
0.0	0.104876916434	And, we come out here, and we do our thing.
0.0	0.431125227782	We can't just allow it to continue on its current path the way that Hillary Clinton wants to do because there'll be major reductions in benefits in the next decade if we do nothing.
0.0	0.294163359722	It's actually evidence of the bias that exists in the American media today.
1.0	0.388416801327	The government stole it, and spent it a long time ago...
0.0	0.330079656556	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government in setting up -- retirement plans.
0.0	0.461470950172	Imagine how hard it is for these people out there that are making 40, 50, $60,000 a year, and they're trying to provide for their families at a time when this economy is not growing.
0.0	0.492664673414	So the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced: a simple flat tax, 10 percent for individuals, and a 16 percent business flat tax, you abolish the IRS...
0.0	0.322181295401	We owned a liquor store, restaurant, bar and we lived in the back.
0.0	0.113866978729	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.0698449199676	You're right.
0.0	0.213504693663	Here is where we are with public education.
0.0	0.120648029177	That is who I'm fighting for.
0.0	0.176525002422	As a senator, yes, I was a senator.
0.0	0.480367633698	ISIS came in, and now occupies significant territory in Libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold.
0.0	0.278659431954	You are working at McDonald's?
0.0	0.0160236753746	But I was born here.
0.0	0.139203582416	They have a responsibility, as well.
0.0	0.387490103799	If we -- if we don't act now, we are going to be the first generation in American history that leaves our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.441627384988	Whose fault is it that Medicare is broken, out of money, that Social Security is broken, out of money?
0.0	0.46382080759	This president has failed, and when I'm in the Oval Office, police officers will know that they will have the support of the president of the Untied States.
0.0	0.251184251464	It was a back sacrifice, and I have to hand it to Ben.
0.0	0.419014855884	There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies.
0.0	0.516423544594	And I'm going to tell you this, we need to use the benefit of our law enforcement people across this country, combined with our intelligence people across this country.
0.0	0.311444781799	He just writes out an executive order.
0.0	0.035388509446	They're off to China.
0.0	0.478959491994	I'm the only one on this stage who has a plan that's actually reduced -- actually going to reduce immigration.
0.0	0.460820218707	We need to be very well aware of the fact that China and Russia are using technology to attack us, just as ISIS is using technology to recruit those who would murder American citizens.
0.0	0.230117406877	And I'll allow putting that tariff or whatever he's saying here...
0.0	0.0490458313966	As an outsider, I tackled H.P.
0.0	0.387962518474	Carl said, "no, no -- " but he's somebody -- these are the kind of people that we should use to negotiate and not the China people that we have who are political hacks who don't know what they're doing and we have problems like this.
0.0	0.21204908743	Two points.
0.0	0.5	Back in 2004, one of my predecessors to the Senate by the name of Bob Graham, a Democrat, ran for president missing over 30 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.452895237419	The agreement on humanitarian relief now needs to be implemented, because there are enclaves that are literally filled with starving people throughout Syria.
0.0	0.332153717767	And I went there, and for 16 years, I fought the insiders and was able to get things done.
0.0	0.244562284797	We have this enormous mismatch because we have smaller and smaller families.
0.0	0.5	Please do not tell me that in this country, if -- and here's the if -- we have the courage to take on the drug companies, and have the courage to take on the insurance companies, and the medical equipment suppliers, if we do that, yes, we can guarantee health care to all people in a much more cost effective way.
0.0	0.29727280732	Big and powerful use big and powerful government to their advantage.
1.0	0.986243211593	I think under President Obama we have seen a lot of advances, the Affordable Care Act has helped more African Americans than any other group to get insurance, to be taken care of, but we also know a lot more than we did.
0.0	0.407494220699	Well, we've gotta turn the economy around for people who are struggling.
0.0	0.141284102932	This is a bad deal.
1.0	0.980873043758	And let us be clear that every proposal that I have introduced has been paid for.
0.0	0.312259035303	In my family, my dad fled oppression in Cuba to come to America.
0.0	0.259860496438	It's the strongest pro-worker immigration plan.
0.0	0.382896393711	And let me tell you, ISIS and terrorists do not get their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.751813079593	No.
0.0	0.0380045669031	We can't do this unilaterally.
0.0	0.0295980996706	I would change them.
0.0	0.478945006369	I stood on the stage and watched Marco in rather indignantly, look at Governor Bush and say, someone told you that because we're running for the same office, that criticizing me will get you to that office.
0.0	0.381590312162	This is about more than replacing a D with an R. We need a leader who will help us take our government back.
0.0	0.259983651962	They are employing themselves, they are potentially employing others.
0.0	0.355114779317	And we can take that message and that formula to Washington to lift every single American to a better life.
0.0	0.281188181025	And at the end of the day, it was the president's decision.
0.0	0.413457807758	A person who, in fact, has a long experience in foreign-policy issues, which is different from many of the other governors and prospective governors who are running.
0.0	0.301098433828	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.398739266728	But, here is a pledge I've made throughout this campaign, and it's really not a very radical pledge.
0.0	0.188382193112	There's a big question mark on your head.
0.0	0.751813079593	Again...
0.0	0.261598010972	As you too know, I know I built a very great company.
0.0	0.5	Whether it's welfare reform and getting something back for the hard-earned taxpayers; whether it's engaging in Pentagon reform and taking on the big contractors that were charging thousands of dollars for hammers and screw drivers and ripping us off; or whether it's taking on the special interests in the nursing home industry in Ohio, so that mom and dad can have the ability to stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.
0.0	0.24825234261	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.055761104513	And this is not an endeavor that rewards that.
0.0	0.33748857534	We need to use our technological advantages, because what we've warned of is an international guerrilla movement that threatens this country.
0.0	0.263401475958	I think I'm going to win fair and square (inaudible) to win this way.
0.0	0.369575909593	But getting back to Martha's question about how we end dependency, do we have to have a cultural change?
0.0	0.330776560556	It's very important we focus on the threats we face today, and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in.
0.0	0.478135262127	And, look, I think it's important to look at what the most important counterterrorism judgment of the first four years of the Obama administration was, and that was the very difficult decision as to whether or not to advise the president to go after bin Laden.
0.0	0.0291463009766	It's not responsible.
0.0	0.187016445605	So, I would pass legislation outlawing abortion after 20 weeks.
0.0	0.23776543172	Our country doesn't win anymore.
0.0	0.0286987235331	That's who's in my mind
0.0	0.0332987084017	It is a complicated relationship.
0.0	0.349892288687	Bernie Sanders has already said it.
0.0	0.35322721526	But I look at this country today, and I look at how divided we are, I look at how politicians are always posturing and issuing sound bites but never solving problems.
0.0	0.510310127441	In the crowd today is Major General James Livingston, who's the co-chairman of my campaign here in South Carolina, a Medal of Honor recipient.
0.0	0.542249812974	We have to put the personnel on that border in the right places; you have to put the strategic fencing in place; and you have to have aviation assets that fly all the way from Tijuana to El Paso to Brownsville, Texas -- 1,933 miles looking down 24/7, with the technology to be able to identify what individuals are doing, and ID when they are in obviously illegal activities or suspicious activities, and quick response teams come.
0.0	0.439690838129	Both Donald and Jeb have good points, and there is a middle ground.
0.0	0.0537452246719	I'm ready.
0.0	0.463655320432	Senator Sanders voted against it at that time.
0.0	0.519571978096	The simple fact is one of the ways, Maria, to solve the problem you described is narrow the number of people coming by family petitioning to what every other country has so that we have the best and the brightest that come to our country.
0.0	0.0723941345223	OK, good.
1.0	0.981597464375	But I want to -- I want to follow up on something having to do with leadership, because, you know, today Senator Sanders said that President Obama failed the presidential leadership test.
0.0	0.27136312421	Let me -- let me answer your question on the Sun-Sentinel editorial today.
0.0	0.184502490483	Bill, I defeated Mario Cuomo.
0.0	0.24713087859	Well, let me -- let me first of all talk a little bit about my experience.
0.0	0.19739874748	I'm going to get a response to that, Neil.
0.0	0.365473679498	I just want to remind you, people paid their money.
0.0	0.435063688737	This issue now has to be about stopping ISIS entering the United States, and when I'm president we will.
0.0	0.253811723682	I know what it's like to owe that money, and we've worked hard.
0.0	0.514650349765	I've said I'm looking at a couple of different ways, one which you mentioned, Senator, but also trying to expand the existing tax to passive income that wealthy people have so that we do get more revenue into the Social Security Trust Fund.
0.0	0.271185095649	We will renew America if we work together, and I am totally confident that we will.
0.0	0.113829151409	See, they don't like that.
0.0	0.120257847341	Or that we're just going to be great?
0.0	0.234728271446	In fact, that's part of the problem.
0.0	0.320619042544	It will cause the economy to grow, to explode, to create more jobs.
0.0	0.229999754646	Everybody just needs to get used to it.
0.0	0.274230347017	And they consorted with Barack Obama to steal from Social Security.
0.0	0.0907994093058	Well, I respectfully disagree.
0.0	0.00280881569458	Thank you.
0.0	0.32171331471	The agreement on a cease-fire, though, is something that has to be implemented more quickly than the schedule that the Russians agreed to.
0.0	0.450735725034	The reason that I -- I hate them so much is because every single regulation costs in terms of goods and services.
0.0	0.00444988481404	You do the arithmetic.

0.0	0.104725942237	I think he would have been right.
0.0	0.408086587139	That expertise needs to spread all across the government and there needs to be much more cooperation with our private sector.
0.0	0.167121695291	I think that would have been right, as well.
0.0	0.132075228553	I came to Washington, D.C. in 1990.
0.0	0.30020874525	First of all, yes, we've stolen.

0.0	0.241586852845	As far as the wall is concerned, we're going to build a wall.
0.0	0.376673418754	We need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources, but from sources overseas, that can be a real-time fusion effort to get information where it's needed.
0.0	0.0552860131359	It's good to be with you.
0.0	0.526893615152	But in terms of shutting down the government, I don't think President Obama should choose to shut down the government simply to send taxpayer dollars to this group that has been caught, I believe, breaking the law, but also offending our values and our ethics.
0.0	0.061658811062	How do I know this?
0.0	0.354157212384	Lots of people will say lots of different things about me in this campaign and others, but the one thing they've never said about me is that I'm misunderstood.
0.0	0.180894738389	His family certainly believes that.
0.0	0.452596736132	I happen to believe that Putin is doing what he is doing because his economy is increasingly in shambles and he's trying to rally his people in support of him.
0.0	0.125307014641	That's what I'm working towards.
0.0	0.174051559789	Well, I want to know, did you win?

0.0	0.136526401963	I did a couple of speeches for them, I do speeches for other people.
0.0	0.552836491548	That's why I'm running for office because when I become president of the United States, on my first day in office we are going to repeal every single one of his unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.0401080066054	Check it out.

0.0	0.540323838613	Every progressive economist who has analyzed that says that the numbers don't add up, and that's a promise that cannot be kept, and it's really important now that we are getting into the rest of the country that both of us are held to account for explaining what we are proposing because, especially with healthcare, this is not about math.
0.0	0.554244191516	We inherited a system that was set up during World War II; 170 million Americans get health insurance right now through their employers.
0.0	0.35865625222	Well, this is one of the reasons why Tom Perkins and I had disagreements in the boardroom, Becky.
0.0	0.37300862694	If I become President because we'll have a Constitutional Amendment to require a federally balanced budget so they will do their job.
0.0	0.117443383392	It never happens.

0.0	0.0444881130138	I can do that.
0.0	0.482075569306	And that's why I've offered a specific program to the people of America tonight to address the fundamental problem of getting our country growing again, getting our economy growing, wages up, opportunities for people.
0.0	0.0439999572887	Do we have answer for that?
0.0	0.230808670489	I'm going to keep making sure that everything I've done, everything that I stand for is going to be well known.
0.0	0.0185685051645	It's Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.455968138884	Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns.
0.0	0.322940911655	Because, folks, at the end of the day, the country needs healed.
0.0	0.51245054882	I'd also go after these sanctuary cities, do everything we can to make sure that we are not -- that we are actually prosecuting and cutting off funding for cities that are harboring illegal aliens, and then finally making sure the IRS is not going after conservative or religious groups.
0.0	0.409826025896	Here's -- apart from the -- apart from the higher prices on consumers and people are living paycheck to paycheck, apart from that, there will be retaliation.

0.0	0.454743601392	I have the opportunity not just to run, but to win in the deep blue state of New York three times.
0.0	0.5	Well, first of all, when we talk about the Import Export Bank, it's time to clean up corporate welfare.
0.0	0.429734887803	And when the president of the United States gets out to speak about it, does he support police officers?
0.0	0.284780765132	My plan would sweep all of them into a regulatory framework so we can try to get ahead of what the next problems might be.
0.0	0.137987766817	You just want to...
0.0	0.420939861248	At the same time, law enforcement understands there are people in the community who not only think that the system doesn't work for them, but works against them.
0.0	0.438388724217	You find a Democrat that's for cutting taxes -- cutting spending ten dollars, I'll give them a warm kiss.
0.0	0.181248676982	Such a nasty -- such a nasty question, but thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.424085722613	We have got to demilitarize local police departments so they do not look like occupying armies.
0.0	0.019297403515	This is a humanitarian catastrophe.
0.0	0.354847263631	As far as Mark is concerned, as far as the visas are concerned, if we need people, they have -- it's fine.
0.0	0.267589640072	But we also need to reform Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.507870528487	And we will join the rest of the other -- the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families.
0.0	0.270607420364	This president allows lawlessness throughout this country.
0.0	0.348935836775	I want to speak to all our fighting men and women.
0.0	0.378785188631	I know some people like to say, "well, this is free money."
0.0	0.26858435729	And here's the last piece...
0.0	0.261359219811	What we need to do is destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.0819876104673	She was right.
0.0	0.414725911542	I certainly agree with FDR for all the reasons Senator Sanders said.
0.0	0.464003476972	Now, the proposal that I have outlined, you know, should be familiar to you, because it is what essentially Barack Obama campaigned on in 2008.
0.0	0.415283958048	Because when government gets big and powerful, the big feel like they need to get even bigger to deal with all that power, and meanwhile, the small and the powerless -- in this case, 1,590 community banks -- go out of business.
0.0	0.121609302465	But, let me tell you who not to blame.
0.0	0.0295980996706	I would change them.
0.0	0.457569539802	In my case, whether it's health care, or getting us to debt-free tuition, or moving us toward paid family leave, I have been very specific about where I would raise the money, how much it would cost, and how I would move this agenda forward.
0.0	0.400247480259	We now have much more information about what must be done to fix our criminal justice system.
1.0	0.593282758105	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.0157130108058	I was not that candidate.
0.0	0.376776224312	Now, who are the people who are hurt by that?
0.0	0.0989688525801	It should be what are your substantive positions...
0.0	0.426451816021	Now, thank God, my father was invited to a Bible study and became born again and he came back to my mom and me and we were raised together.
0.0	0.298736342694	But many, many people did.
0.0	0.5	Listen, in any Republican primary, everyone is going to say they support the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.333754299394	Good question, but I want to tell you, my great concern is that we are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job.
0.0	0.146911218069	Where did that spirit come from in America?
0.0	0.280263090692	The government ought to wear a striped shirt and just make sure the game...
0.0	0.318646941097	I think maybe my greatest weakness is that I trust people too much.
0.0	0.39723878215	So whether it's green cards or any other form of entry into America, when I'm president if we do not know who you are or why you are coming, you are not going to get into the United States of America.
0.0	0.492189069409	We're going to suspend and repeal every executive order, every regulation that cost American jobs and is -- is -- is impacting our freedom.
0.0	0.425628515612	We will use those proceeds, a hundred billion a year, to invest in rebuilding our infrastructure.
0.0	0.0718702984645	When I was 21, my mom died.
0.0	0.264660551243	I've seen plenty of other people follow up?
0.0	0.449764445409	You know, a minute ago, Neil asked: What has President Obama do -- done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns?
0.0	0.751813079593	How about this?
0.0	0.139933695205	And guess what, in 2011, I got a deal...
0.0	0.21525455526	I lead the opposition against it.
0.0	0.545025105719	And what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice.
0.0	0.285809281392	I will continue to have tremendous admiration and respect for Governor Bush.
0.0	0.152795250047	We could overthrow Assad tomorrow if we wanted to.
0.0	0.240027161409	...Or, even some famous Colorado brownies.
0.0	0.270806253877	It's like a 400 pound man saying, "I'm going to go on a diet, but I'm eating a sack of Krispy Kremes before I do."
0.0	0.105881715387	So there's a lot of balanced interests.
0.0	0.355541806034	I mean, literally, the Senate -- what is it, like a French work week?
0.0	0.574394917189	In the first day in office, my first executive order, I revoked every one of the executive orders that he had -- he had enacted over the prior 12 years.
0.0	0.216338738012	I've got a track record.
0.0	0.220211619861	Now, on to your substantive question.
0.0	0.270413523366	I would like to start with a basic.
0.0	0.227447708666	And I make a lot more than the average American.
0.0	0.339201654746	Donald Trump actually seized on it when he talked about immigration.
0.0	0.310162375673	We don't need to add new rules, we need to make sure the FBI does its job.
0.0	0.417135160579	I have gone time and time again to take on the vested interests who would keep women's health care decisions the province of the government instead of women ourselves.
0.0	0.257592179686	Here's my second problem.
1.0	0.988972825693	Ted Cruz, you used to say you supported doubling the number of green cards, now you say that you're against it.
0.0	0.509219167572	And if you go to my Web site, berniesanders.com, what you find is not only going to help lead the opposition to that war, but much of what I feared would happen when I spoke on the floor of the House, in fact, did happen in terms of the instability that occurred.
0.0	0.28379646199	Let me say, I read that editorial today with a great amusement.
0.0	0.38515530944	When I'm president of the United States we are getting rid of Obamacare and we are rebuilding our military.
0.0	0.401684051978	And I said, "Didn't you resent America for not letting you be with your father in those formative and very threatening years?"
0.0	0.34506451035	It's a blessing that we're living longer, so we have to increase the retirement age to reflect that blessing.
0.0	0.265786502789	This is incredibly complicated, because we've got Iran as a big player, in addition to Russia.
1.0	0.977648014628	Someone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander in chief and someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi can never be president of the United States.
0.0	0.20810280711	Let me just -- let me respond.
0.0	0.279488561829	But the Democrats are going to bring a lawsuit, and you have to have certainty.
0.0	0.0878352885836	Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, they're no better.
0.0	0.198446630775	See when you're a senator, what you get to do is just talk and talk and talk.
0.0	0.245866683109	So there are people watching tonight in business.
0.0	0.546677449447	I can tell you, after spending seven years as a former federal prosecutor, right after 9/11, dealing with this issue.
0.0	0.31457994549	He just writes out an order, executive order.
0.0	0.363678620729	You can trust me to do the following: that when I get on change with Hillary Clinton, we won't be debating about the science, we'll be debating about the solutions.
0.0	0.249955034577	We have work to do, and we now know a lot more than we ever did before.
0.0	0.139642167252	They're never going to let it happen.
0.0	0.273482398398	It's the only way you fix Medicare, the only way you fix Social Security.
0.0	0.303096876418	But I like to be unpredictable so that people don't know exactly... (LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.284857338205	...in the world for people...
0.0	0.337157559614	Well, this goes to the question you were just asking.
0.0	0.0749689671049	It is undermining American democracy.
0.0	0.444672278164	The only way to figure that out is to go back to getting the intelligence community the funding and the tools that it needs to be able to keep America safe.
0.0	0.054400939665	He was such a nice guy.
0.0	0.44503011085	People with a high school education or less are not even living as long as their parents lived.
0.0	0.294228622622	This is one of the great tragedies in our country today.
0.0	0.338944003797	And we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid.
0.0	0.36106300305	Look, every time the Federal Government gets engaged in something it gets worse.
0.0	0.46373730348	Well, first of all, this is an issue that's been debated now for 30 years.
0.0	0.471248570735	Jeb Bush says we've got to be willing to lose the primary in order to win the general.
0.0	0.509238245397	But view is those trade policies have enabled corporate America to shut down in this country, throw millions of people out on the street.
0.0	0.061658811062	And how do I know it?
0.0	0.113826389867	I will begin tomorrow to filibuster it.
0.0	0.441030860952	Do you think that the Chinese, if they had a 45 percent tariff imposed on all their imports wouldn't retaliate and start buying Airbus?
0.0	0.567771576265	Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the co-chair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat.
0.0	0.378360920749	So if you happen to be right, you could get the top job at the end of the day.
0.0	0.190336286704	That is not protected religious belief.
0.0	0.18764665101	This is absolutely disgusting, and revolts the conscience of the nation.
0.0	0.0944772387124	Because I've done it.
0.0	0.134564277114	They explode the bomb, we have an electromagnetic pulse.
0.0	0.338148409091	It's the most exceptional country the world has ever known.
0.0	0.5	I think to be commander in chief in the 21st century requires someone who understands how the economy works, someone who understands how the world works and who's in it; I know more world leaders on the stage today than anyone running, with the possible exception of Hillary Clinton; understands bureaucracies, how to cut them down to size and hold them accountable; and understands technology, which is a tool, but it's also a weapon that's being used against us.
0.0	0.269064993928	I had to work my way through school.
0.0	0.261642801436	The number of women --
0.0	0.34496248909	Kissinger was one of those people during the Vietnam era who talked about the domino theory.
0.0	0.425951456246	Could I -- could I bring something up here, because I'm a constituent of the senator and I helped him and I expected that he would do constituent service, which means that he shows up to work.
0.0	0.373346600102	That is the fight we have to have, and we have to undo a whole set of things that President Obama has done that get at the heart of his disrespect and disregard for too many Americans.
0.0	0.258672480145	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.313003403617	But you ought to acknowledge the government doesn't do a very good job at it.
0.0	0.330297391605	We have got to destroy their training camps over there before they can attack us here.
0.0	0.30682957292	But also where it's affordable, solar, wind in Iowa has become very affordable and it makes sense.
0.0	0.0918438048607	I got the briefings.
0.0	0.35048417082	As president of the United States, I will be a commander in chief that will have the back of the military.
0.0	0.141018031705	Yes, I might feel more comfortable.
0.0	0.5	I've also called for the end of family detention, for the end of privately-run detention centers, along with private prisons, which I think are really against the common good and the rule of law.
0.0	0.167122724771	And that's why Ronald Reagan said that it was a blindfold.
0.0	0.259284514146	The government has tried it their way.
0.0	0.359708360218	We're going to lose Social Security and Medicare if Republicans and Democrats do not come together and find a solution like Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.405941978437	You don't have seven children and bring them into this world if you're not optimistic about the future of this country.
0.0	0.348131365547	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, it is demonstrably true...
0.0	0.300361108916	So I know Secretary Kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease-fire up as quickly as possible.
0.0	0.264322955699	There's nobody out there looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.456372288803	One of them is a statewide use of deadly force.
0.0	0.282030587324	That is a bad deal and an evil situation, and presidents have looked the other way.
0.0	0.328564030222	We're going dark when it comes to detecting the next attack.
