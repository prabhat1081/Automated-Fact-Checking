0.0	0.329344904244	This is an interesting point when you talk about immigration.
0.0	0.434648849506	Much of the discussion is centered over whether or not the different tax plans help, or affect the middle class.
0.0	0.253753917805	I would like to take a hard look at every part of the federal government and really do the kind of analysis that would rebuild some confidence in people that we're taking a hard look about what we have, you know, and what we don't need anymore.
0.0	0.357426341955	We need to be on the side that keeps Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.384589213178	That's not true.
0.0	0.631960821175	The rate -- the rate -- the rate is gonna be much closer to 15 percent.
0.0	0.471564124214	And so Senator Graham is right about this.
0.0	0.14704773332	This is what's going on.
0.0	0.480448254684	Under that theory, not only would I be disqualified, Marco Rubio would be disqualified, Bobby Jindal would be disqualified and, interestingly enough, Donald J. Trump would be disqualified.
0.0	0.251453723917	The talk has got to stop, the action has got to begin.
0.0	0.633468340168	Yes, the wealthiest people, the top 1.5 percent, will pay more in taxes.
0.0	0.29286383485	So what we're going to have to start doing instead of, you know, picking on this group or this group, is we're going to have to have a major reduction in the regulatory influence that is going on.
0.0	0.406460560902	We need to rebuild our military, and this president has let it diminish to a point where tinpot dictators like the mullahs in Iran are taking our Navy ships.
0.0	0.469381594159	But I also think that these are very serious times; 75 percent of the American people think the federal government is corrupt.
0.0	0.418220635929	This is not some small scale group.
0.0	0.375692692597	We have to lead a coalition that will take back territory from ISIS.
0.0	0.0901229354617	And you know what?
0.0	0.100362479424	Why?
0.0	0.570958192805	This is money that people have confiscated out of their paychecks.
0.0	0.421307671601	They are a sophisticated purveyor of propaganda, a celebrator of violence, an instigator of attacks using their online presence.
0.0	0.244084371753	So we have work to do.
0.0	0.298786935231	I think President Obama has set a great example.
0.0	0.440564133069	And this president turns his back -- this president doesn't enforce the marijuana laws in this country because he doesn't agree with them.
0.0	0.312963755543	We're going to save Social Security, and we're going to save Medicare.
0.0	0.445660608774	You're going to get it by paying your employees less and charging your customers more, that is a tax, the difference is, you don't see it on the bill.
0.0	0.461413457216	Our waste water plants, our rail, our airports, in many places are disintegrating.
0.0	0.360205853678	The majority of people in American actually have values and principles and they believe in the very things that made America great.
0.0	0.328592898766	So -- you know, you shouldn't misrepresent how well you're doing with the polls.
0.0	0.397059136944	And finally, on health care, why don't we start treating -- keep giving...
0.0	0.23655281925	And the idea that this negotiation -- I will tell you one thing.
0.0	0.548205086551	If you look at a single mom buying groceries, she sees hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent.
0.0	0.443240286201	She admitted she had sent e-mails to her family saying, "Hey, this attack at Benghazi was caused by Al Qaida-like elements."
0.0	0.56593828501	Millions of people have high deductibles and co-payments.
0.0	0.152905166567	See, here's the thing.
0.0	0.486290270703	But it is a general economic issue.
0.0	0.353914403844	Target the efforts for people that are committing crimes with guns, and if you do that, and get it right, you're going to be much better off than creating a political argument where there's a big divide.
0.0	0.463637187728	But we can do is defund Planned Parenthood, and by the way, put in place an absolute permanent ban on any taxpayer dollars ever being used to fund abortions.
0.0	0.444395076173	Because -- because Donald's mother was born in Scotland.
0.0	0.250191203457	But let me say one more thing.
0.0	0.100362479424	It is.
0.0	0.403656288981	Government is the enemy.
0.0	0.482292342506	The first speech I gave in this campaign back in April was about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration.
0.0	0.344913407184	And we're going to just fix everything with waste, fraud, and abuse?
0.0	0.467198035665	They see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on Wall Street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all.
0.0	0.269337900224	I'm angry because our country is a mess.
0.0	0.426440347958	We must insist on assimilation -- immigration without assimilation is an invasion.
0.0	0.435391302088	And yet the man who led my firing, Tom Perkins, an icon of Silicon Valley, has come out publicly and said, "you know what?
0.0	0.414568729424	I know that we are at greater risk today than at any time since then of another attack.

0.0	0.411139878431	A terrible sight.
0.0	0.419598229677	How about we get the government to do what they're supposed to be doing, secure our borders, protect our people, and support American values and American families.
0.0	0.345496618498	I was ready to lead, but I wasn't ready to run.

0.0	0.42797024804	And by the way, the police are the most mistreated people in this country.
0.0	0.38368580339	And unlike President Obama, where he refuses even to use the term of what's going on, he can't use the term for whatever reason.
0.0	0.431754222456	We agree that Wall Street should never be allowed to wreck Main Street again.
0.0	0.40425816314	And everything is costing more money, and we are killing our -- our -- our people like this.

0.0	0.588496526108	Our Medicare for all single-payer proposal will save the average middle class family $5,000 a year.
0.0	0.434770539784	Why in God's name does Wall Street...

0.0	0.361265388214	Let me give you one quick example.
1.0	0.688849347029	We borrow a million dollars a minute.

0.0	0.270233913926	And in fact I would go further.
0.0	0.386261420203	And, sending mixed signals to kids about drugs is a disaster.
0.0	0.500578276469	White people?
0.0	0.418783518391	Well, let us level with the American people.
0.0	0.31604029167	We didn't spend any.
0.0	0.450572271657	Yes, they have to stop trying to destabilize the Middle East, causing even more chaos.
0.0	0.299750851601	Here is the case, they both agree, they can't make a deal.
0.0	0.480267786109	Secondly, in our state, we went from a loss of 350,000 jobs to, now, a gain of 347,000 jobs to the positive.
0.0	0.214320574302	I want security.
0.0	0.514945235424	The Democrats' answer to everything is more government control over wages, and more empowering trial lawyers to file lawsuits.
0.0	0.445388942447	In my own state, for example, we launched an investigation, asked the FBI to cooperate.
0.0	0.255937230715	You're not going to even allow them to come to our country?
0.0	0.251633239319	I do not think we should promise or even look toward normalizing relations because we have a lot of other business to get done with Iran.
0.0	0.326967055774	You know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money.
0.0	0.262440788404	And if you really want to believe that you can get your voice back, I will tell you, as I have all my career, I will continue to fight for you, because you're the ones that built this country, and will carry it into the future.
0.0	0.24285840851	When you're a governor, you're held accountable for everything you do.

0.0	0.491770576783	That's my bill.
0.0	0.496279163974	... Of course there will be a limit, but when today you have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, when the middle class is disappearing, you have the highest rate of child poverty of almost any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.218984605722	Let me start -- I want to get to the substance of the question on jobs, but I want to start with something.
0.0	0.0430642640462	Thank you.
0.0	0.404437037698	Well, there's no question that ISIS is a very serious problem, and I don't believe that this administration recognizes how serious it is.
0.0	0.336539178636	I've had my issues with Donald Trump.
0.0	0.328497651512	And this summer, we didn't do that.
0.0	0.262248369074	I'm totally open to a tariff.
0.0	0.167805221968	Here is the one thing I'm not going to do.
0.0	0.376411891402	That's why I've been leading the fight to stop it.
1.0	0.674478468319	Under longstanding U.S. law, the child of a U.S. citizen born abroad is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.413421741698	I have a debt to America I'll never repay.
0.0	0.129348903854	Think about it.

0.0	0.321089632071	Come with me to Iraq and Afghanistan, folks.
0.0	0.312402655566	He has got -- that is why he is on the end.
0.0	0.584921291923	They will also have to pay 16 percent on the money they pay their employees.
0.0	0.437275461017	If you listen to the State of the Union the other night, he described them as a bunch of guys with long beards on the back of a pickup truck.
0.0	0.303131797511	We haven't.
0.0	0.313375265609	But this is what you're seeing in the Republican debate that you didn't see in that Democrat debate.
0.0	0.428693158264	Because so many people in my family worked in steel mills, and they didn't work with a white collar, they worked in a blue collar.
0.0	0.328936419715	And we need to do that throughout the country.
0.0	0.154426766821	But I know who the pessimist is.
0.0	0.414198152654	... they don't like the Wall Street Journal.
0.0	0.319536396325	And so everybody needs to discount some of the things you're going to hear in these ads, and discount the -- the back-and-forth here, because every person here is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.46278437572	I support NAFTA.
0.0	0.459120487241	That's why George Romney, Mitt's dad, was eligible to run for president, even though he was born in Mexico.
0.0	0.31105008105	He got lucky with fracking.
0.0	0.411139878431	It was a terrible sight.
0.0	0.344670935491	Hardworking immigrant families living in fear, who should be brought out of the shadows so they and their children can have a better future.
0.0	0.302171779286	Like rich kids, they deserve to get a free education.
0.0	0.373937967548	They discussed how -- how hard it is to sell tractors in China, because all the regulatory barriers.
0.0	0.187596624033	Or somebody else.
0.0	0.264437278608	Big difference.
0.0	0.479010751315	And it's why I've continued to focus on the fact that we need to declare war on the four big cost drivers because 80 percent of all medical costs in this country are chronic disease.
0.0	0.244660788542	We need to make sure that people understand, as Jeb said before, that if you've done extraordinarily well in this country, do you want them to take more out of your taxes now and think they're gonna give it back to you later?
0.0	0.100362479424	...
0.0	0.37743100098	But also, I can't fake anger.
0.0	0.477119983083	Here's what I would do Neil, I would appoint an Attorney General and I would have one very brief conversation with that Attorney General.
0.0	0.447045232455	And I think the reason he did is because immigration is sort of an example of what's broken and what's wrong in Washington, D..C.
0.0	0.362581572641	We put in place mandatory work fair (ph).
0.0	0.272773592518	Too often, they give up, they negotiate with themselves.
0.0	0.241327716502	So I'm going to keep making that case.
0.0	0.407396802279	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.333472761671	You also have to prove that you're going to pay these people more than you would pay someone else, so that you're not undercutting it by bringing in cheap labor.
0.0	0.37706842558	I think there is constitutional and legal authority for the president to have done what he did.
0.0	0.278693874234	He doesn't want to get people together, the old-fashioned way, where you get Congress.
0.0	0.256094740842	I hope you will make a decision soon on this.
0.0	0.36224838496	I will do everything I can to make certain that the United States and our brave men and women in the military do not get bogged down in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.
0.0	0.389268016687	But also the biggest people (ph) -- now I've used that to my advantage as a business man, for my family, for myself.
0.0	0.294854467815	It's a joke.
0.0	0.399503347333	We also need a nominee, a candidate who will endorse our own principles.
0.0	0.100362479424	And...
0.0	0.394773280186	Detailed plans count, and I believe that the plan I've laid out to destroy ISIS before the tragedies of San Bernardino and Paris are the right ones.
0.0	0.324107295991	And I was proud to stand with him and support it.
0.0	0.487188976441	Are you fed up with how Washington wastes your money?
0.0	0.433414041002	There's a reason Gun Owners of America has endorsed me in this race.
1.0	0.928083920423	Median wages have stagnated.
0.0	0.329191328466	We've worked hard our whole life to provide a better family -- a better life for our family.
0.0	0.384470298338	I ask for your support to build, together, a safer and stronger America.
0.0	0.331813837558	If we reengage and get involved, yeah, we can have health care for all people, we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.470716785812	A rich person does not.
0.0	0.538617578614	And, where we are failing abysmally is in the very high rate of recidivism we see.
0.0	0.386167782359	We call that the American Dream, although, it's built on the universal dream of a better life.
0.0	0.404077246471	If you're a farmer, if you're a rancher, if you are small business owner, the death tax is gone.
0.0	0.175716457407	... the fact is, Neil, let's think about -- let's think about -- and I want to maybe -- I hope the president is watching tonight, because here's what I'd like to tell him.
0.0	0.583368648684	It's a 20 percent flat rate tax, it'll take a blowtorch to the -- to the IRS.
0.0	0.392266063287	We need to lead a force, a Sunni led force inside of Syria.
0.0	0.404727798362	And listen, there is a real difference between Marco's tax plan and mine.
0.0	0.304067242469	I was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came.
0.0	0.339150107761	In my administration, we will help to make sure we bring people together in the Middle East, and we will fight ISIS and defeat them.
0.0	0.479698237042	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.236161464819	I want to be in -- I want America to be the best...
0.0	0.420007124344	We hear all this discussion about well, I would do this, or I would do that, when the fact is, the border is still porous.
0.0	0.324691741813	But the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with Iran, maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world, yes, that is something I want to achieve.
0.0	0.0901229354617	And you know what?
0.0	0.462247790014	I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would.
1.0	0.778366346137	Very few children.
0.0	0.345042720265	Hopefully after the 2016 election, some of the Republicans will come to their senses and realize we are not going to deport 11 or 12 million people in this country.
0.0	0.182946455647	And you can go get it at jeb2016.com.
0.0	0.589448033179	The second point, it does not eliminate the corporate tax or the payroll tax.
0.0	0.27342515676	We're becoming Greece if we don't work together.
0.0	0.3811871946	Trying to get Iran and Saudi Arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter.
0.0	0.662085568469	We are at 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.186267040877	Mr. President, we're not against you.
0.0	0.244322061046	Actually, I'd love to get you to build a wall.

0.0	0.334879190265	Let me (inaudible).
0.0	0.404186545956	That's why we embraced individual liberty, and we became the freest people ever, and the result was the American miracle.
0.0	0.420512379076	It's kind of basic.
1.0	0.506382886533	We're sitting up here talking about all these other things; 71 percent of federal spending today is on entitlements, and debt service.
0.0	0.46269095258	This is not entitlement, it's not welfare.
0.0	0.396265408392	I used the tithing analogy.
0.0	0.432056786605	And somebody walked in and shot them, killed them.
0.0	0.502834242451	Before this, I was a very successful person as a developer and as a businessman.
0.0	0.421193765076	And to expand on Mr. Carson's -- or Dr. Carson's question, let's face it, we have laws already.
0.0	0.261359546653	What are the rules on who gets to follow up.
0.0	0.437153792364	Let me tell you what I would do immediately, day two in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.427920486664	According to the generals that I know and trust, this air campaign will not destroy ISIL.
0.0	0.421590715598	Ohio, one of the best growing places in the country -- I not only did it in Washington, I did it in Ohio, and I'll go back to Washington, and there will be no more silly deals...
0.0	0.422012462231	We've cut taxes, balanced budgets, changed the regulatory environment.
0.0	0.415628724695	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.465640546085	Nobody wants to watch three and a half, or three hours.

0.0	0.474398983946	Every election we talk about Medicare and Social Security reform.
0.0	0.31062242702	... so you don't actually want to hear the answer, John?
0.0	0.341737025259	And you combine that with a plan to make manufacturing -- this country number one in manufacturing, you've got someone who's going to help revitalize and give hope to America, the place -- the place is that is the most hopeless today.
0.0	0.35139507787	But on this point, if I may add something on this point.
0.0	0.306109887144	You can't just ban all Muslims.
0.0	0.484087045551	You know, that's what the PC culture is all about, and it's destroying this nation.
0.0	0.164486489947	You're welcome.
0.0	0.494031830119	Two of them were among the most highly decorated -- they weren't allowed on a military base to have guns.
0.0	0.438780413671	That is total propaganda, and this is what happens in our society.
0.0	0.227654612739	You're going away for a long, long while.
0.0	0.429682230235	I have a slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially.
0.0	0.443956573977	All over this country we have Republican candidates for president saying we hate the government.
0.0	0.380703961731	And that's why I've come forward with, for example, a plan to revitalize coal country, the coalfield communities that have been so hard hit by the changing economy, by the reduction in the use of coal.
0.0	0.496796283702	And it's a tax you find in many companies in Europe.
0.0	0.259026906661	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.404139886951	It's a private-sector solution that believes in freedom, not Obamacare that believes in government control.
0.0	0.295944518788	We actually did it.
0.0	0.359826128241	It isn't law-abiding gun owners.
0.0	0.153449928165	Well, I would really appreciate that.
0.0	0.338080482925	This is the fantasy...
0.0	0.406526279154	And in fact, in Obama administration, we did not meet with anybody without conditions.
0.0	0.395874912648	Neil, the problem...
0.0	0.304029223423	And -- you know, all of this too big to fail stuff and picking and choosing winners and losers -- this is a bunch of crap, and it is really causing a great deal of -- great deal of problems for our society right now.
0.0	0.331073571523	People aren't dumb.
0.0	0.278815711408	Good at email.
0.0	0.471584853026	Illegal.
0.0	0.38145971434	And that's what I'll offer to the people of the United States in this candidacy for the presidency.
0.0	0.320330939603	And what I have said is I will not throw us further into debt.
0.0	0.508362170172	So what if mass unemployment exists?
0.0	0.383230868304	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.292663558081	Their kids are having a hard time finding any work at all.
0.0	0.327719450232	So we have to go after this both abroad and at home.
0.0	0.380192156365	And believe me, Assad is not worth it.
0.0	0.346926212577	I agree with my colleagues.
0.0	0.261637992641	Look, it takes three things basically to grow jobs.
1.0	0.789127898459	I would note that Art Laffer, Ronald Reagan's chief economic adviser, has written publicly, that my simple flat tax is the best tax plan of any of the individuals on this stage cause it produces economic growth, it raises wages and it helps everyone from the very poorest to the very richest.
0.0	0.404441661519	Well, first of all, if a company gets caught doing that, they should never be able to use the program again.
0.0	0.4797033542	It is a false choice.
0.0	0.195363128293	I said no.
0.0	0.203592131736	I am passionate about what I believe.
0.0	0.259724603171	Get over that one, OK?
0.0	0.411976025721	You think about the regulatory cost and the tax cost -- that's why small businesses are closing, rather than being formed in our country right now.
0.0	0.674551416377	My 750,000 donors have contributed more than a million and a half donations.
0.0	0.300389852412	Today, I'm 60, I'm not married, I don't have any kids.
0.0	0.337227857808	That's how you go from secretary to CEO.
0.0	0.295296353648	You know, I think most people know exactly what New York values are.
0.0	0.398246477959	There are a lot of people living paycheck to paycheck in Florida as well, they're looking for a senator that will fight for them each and every day.
0.0	0.564163823749	...income tax...
0.0	0.257798059344	I think he has addressed a lot of these issues that have been quite difficult, but he has gone forward.
0.0	0.347860918463	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.20067124245	And I will tell you something that really galls me.
0.0	0.434184672534	I choose him as my vice presidential candidate, and the Democrats sue because we can't take him along for the ride.
0.0	0.471113909729	It is why we have to reduce the size and power of government.
0.0	0.362235890975	Nobody -- I could stand up here all night.
0.0	0.289395730328	And when they let me down, if they let me down, I never forgive.
0.0	0.360505361223	I think our country is tired of the politicians who simply read the polls and fail to lead.
0.0	0.342788124183	Turns out that the African-American community and the Latino community were hit especially hard.
0.0	0.419523788147	There are other attorneys that feel, and very, very fine constitutional attorneys, that feel that because he was not born on the land, he cannot run for office.
0.0	0.319890480266	And if you become the nominee, who the hell knows if you can even serve in office?
0.0	0.329737209812	But guess who pushed for that regulation?
0.0	0.229536418668	I think that is the real key here.
0.0	0.385980439029	But we're running for the presidency of the United States here.
0.0	0.431237221426	And if I am elected president, to every soldier and sailor and airman and marine, and to every police officer and firefighter and first responder who risk their lives to keep us safe, I will have your back.
0.0	0.35479401437	That could be the great Trojan Horse.
0.0	0.100362479424	No.
0.0	0.430809112801	So, let's not in anyway imply here that either President Obama or myself, would in anyway not take on any vested interested, whether it's Wall Street, or drug companies, or insurance companies, or frankly, the gun lobby to stand up to do what's best for the American people.
0.0	0.463059685814	First of all, Ohio does have an energy industry, but we're diversified.
0.0	0.389414114118	Credibility counts.
0.0	0.41835976911	Drugs is one of the greatest scourge in this country, and I spent five years of my administration working with my team to do a whole sort of things to try to reign in the problem of overdoses, and it goes on and on.
0.0	0.264039597619	Now, what I think is that right now we have got to do our best in developing positive relations with Russia.
0.0	0.242690180711	We're running.
0.0	0.413437669949	Let the states do this.
0.0	0.349185775467	It is a constitutional right of every American to be able to protect themselves and their families.
0.0	0.294523612047	And at that point, it's a life that we have the right to protect, and I think we should protect.
0.0	0.430888840364	Yes, does Wall Street and big financial interests, along with drug companies, insurance companies, big oil, all of it, have too much influence?
0.0	0.203636846646	HEMMER: Wow.
0.0	0.279295569918	You bet they do.
0.0	0.0958374281122	OK?
0.0	0.304527052404	But I think I'll go back to building buildings if it doesn't work out.
0.0	0.445347775025	I congratulate Secretary of State John Kerry and the president for working on this agreement.
0.0	0.493686848544	No, it should be repealed.
0.0	0.616916760938	Our wages are growing faster than the national average, and I've cut taxes more than any sitting governor in this state -- $5 billion, including no taxes on small business and killing the death tax.
0.0	0.370282112806	The fact is, there is a big overhang.
0.0	0.179857120833	...No, sir...
0.0	0.409836185062	13 Hours -- tomorrow morning, a new movie will debut about the incredible bravery of the men fighting for their lives in Benghazi and the politicians that abandoned them.
0.0	0.162500403692	Well, I've been --
0.0	0.377124579623	They understand the vulnerabilities we have on the southern border.
0.0	0.321713682089	It's not that complicated actually.
0.0	0.52062826881	We sent our parks and wildlife wardens.
0.0	0.521817391132	Barack Obama got his massive tax increase, and there was no spending cuts.
0.0	0.399210068755	So many companies are going to leave our country.
1.0	0.777739125604	And this is not the first time that he has criticized President Obama.
0.0	0.61148193349	And I used it to pay off my loans.
0.0	0.256198199368	But she did say there was anger.
0.0	0.439366202559	According to the FBI and the director of national intelligence, Syria's becoming a perfect platform to strike our nation.
0.0	0.485592077868	And until we deal with the health of Americans and do what we did with polio -- when I was a little kid, we eradicated it.
0.0	0.204457167589	Listen, I want to just comment.
0.0	0.179661874416	You know, you look at what's going on, you see all the divisiveness and the hatred that goes on in our society.
0.0	0.494821506512	The issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24 months ago.
0.0	0.307795962897	You get the Congress, you get the Senate, you get together, you do legislation.
0.0	0.438117605666	This is one of the areas I've disagreed with Senator Sanders on, who has called for Iranian troops trying to end civil war in Syria, which I think would be a grave mistake.
0.0	0.48530799766	If a soldier has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.259026906661	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.314060794453	We have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone.
0.0	0.484903810227	She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video.
0.0	0.486163950122	Not just the hacking of OPM, but that is -- that is just shameful.
0.0	0.403437526406	If these are the kinds of people -- we should use our best and our finest.
0.0	0.245157497718	Divisive and with no vision.
0.0	0.450141715284	I didn't get a phone call from Bill Clinton before I jumped in the race.
0.0	0.388930548057	That is like shouting "fire" in a crowded theater, and that is illegal, and I would do everything in our power not just to go after those who are here who we know who are here, before they can radicalize other Americans to carry out attacks, and it's not just the ones they've arrested.
0.0	0.353407914054	I do not believe that we need to wholesale destroy every American citizen's privacy in order to go after those that we know are suspect or are -- are already a problem.
0.0	0.310637367904	This nation has been great to me, and that's the only way I know to pay you back.
0.0	0.345935200604	At least he's honest enough to call himself a socialist.
0.0	0.50077316527	I believe that when real unemployment is close to 10%, and when our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, Flint, Michigan comes to mind.
0.0	0.359470232221	We need to make the government run smarter and better, and reform this corporate tax system, bring that money back to the United States to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, and we need to use it also to protect our grid from terrorists.
0.0	0.329027494699	We have to obey the laws.
0.0	0.305908161444	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.328023637394	Everytime they got a paycheck, the government reached in and took something out of it before they ever saw it.
0.0	0.495690907873	Roads, bridges, water systems, wastewater plants, who denies that?
0.0	0.326856785214	And when you do that, when you're in a position of managing regulations; when you reduce taxes; and when you have fiscal discipline, you see the job creators begin to get very comfortable with the fact that they can invest.
0.0	0.381062225276	I would sign an executive order protecting religious liberty, our first amendment rights, so Christian business owners and individuals don't face discrimination for having a traditional view of marriage.
0.0	0.359659130762	Well, obviously, you don't understand my views on homosexuality.
0.0	0.356459722266	A Republican Congress did that.
0.0	0.418908255458	There is a war against ISIS, not just against ISIS but against radical jihadists terrorists, and it is a war that they win or we win.
0.0	0.378338766939	It comes from the right, from the left, from people on all sides of the political spectrum.
0.0	0.432654675327	... the American middle class, and who are being attacked by ideologues, by demagogues.
0.0	0.237543289632	This is extraordinary.
0.0	0.377780560825	You had only 21 Republican governors in this country.
0.0	0.415682220917	And recognizing that it's so important, this election, because we're talking about America for the people versus America for the government.
0.0	0.627086761891	After that you pay 10 percent as a flat tax going up.
0.0	0.307219977976	But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work.
0.0	0.558799931563	Because of all the federal mandates and federal laws, it was too expensive.
0.0	0.475728771475	Now you are a worker, white worker, black worker, who had a decent job, that manufacturing job is gone.
1.0	0.636012937279	Secondly, I never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.28707669075	It's not working.
0.0	0.210581542653	I guess just for the fun of it; they want to throw money around.
0.0	0.397922693791	We know (ph) to go ahead and shut off the supply routes, and send in our special ops at 2:00 a.m. and attack them everywhere they go.
0.0	0.0430642640462	Thank you.
0.0	0.405512066025	We have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9/11, and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks, yet we see the terrible attack in San Bernardino and know that we haven't done enough.
0.0	0.344619869564	If i were the president of the United States, I would go and look at every executive order that exists right now and determine which ones want to be voided, because the president shouldn't be legislating: not through that vehicle or any other.
0.0	0.0430642640462	Thank you.
0.0	0.610656050279	He pays on his personal rate, and he is paying higher than the big dry-cleaning chain down the street, because he's paying at his personal rate.
0.0	0.311217865751	It's fine if they come in, but they have to come in legally.
0.0	0.100362479424	No.
0.0	0.343964929656	So I'm asking women, I'm asking men, to support me because I'm ready to go into the White House on January 20th, 2017 and get to work on both domestic and foreign policy challenges.
0.0	0.176098697167	I'm too trusting.
0.0	0.31895561497	We've got a president who cannot bring himself to say the words "radical Islamic terrorism."
0.0	0.379136527095	Now it is their time to help the middle class.
0.0	0.278957724533	That's how you solve the problem.
0.0	0.205571944121	And that is wrong.
0.0	0.363575764953	Those aren't Iowa values, but this is what we believe in New York."
0.0	0.402858267394	You know, coal miners and their families who helped turn on the lights and power our factories for generations are now wondering, has our country forgotten us?
0.0	0.302488169634	And right now, I will be putting up a tremendous -- so far, I've put up less than anybody and I have the best results.
0.0	0.100362479424	...
0.0	0.489667039767	Karen and I have seven children.
0.0	0.471039219506	To the 1 percent who have been fighting this war for over a decade, I'd try my best to be a commander-in-chief worthy of your sacrifice.
0.0	0.517879543093	Last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee.
0.0	0.504731897593	Corporate inversion is one of the biggest problems we have.
0.0	0.41806976319	And I give you my word, if I am elected president, no service man or service woman will be forced to be on their knees, and any nation that captures our fighting men will feel the full force and fury of the United States of America.
0.0	0.296772186385	I looked at the intelligence.
0.0	0.371275005191	And sending that signal makes it impossible for us to be serious about taking out ISIS and restoring democracy in Syria.
0.0	0.34359258065	It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are.
1.0	0.8288111269	When we have more people in jail, disproportionately African American and Latino, than China does, a communist authoritarian society four times our size.
0.0	0.33334571472	And I think once I'm in the White House we will have enough political capital to be able to do that.
0.0	0.424930214232	To use the Justice Department, as we just saw, they have said they are going to sue Ferguson, that entered into a consent agreement, and then tried to back out.
0.0	0.421864005851	So what we have tried to do and what President Obama succeeded in doing was to build on the health care system we have, get us to 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.354716365309	No, not a comic book, and it's not a very nicely asked question the way you say that.
0.0	0.0430642640462	Thank you.
0.0	0.24315570974	If you want someone to grab a beer with, I may not be that guy.
1.0	0.802399355461	And again, paid for.
0.0	0.466463851762	The president has done an executive order with respect to illegal immigration that is illegal.
0.0	0.313985391063	You see, because if you really want to get to a balanced budget, you need to reduce your expenses and you need to grow your economy.
0.0	0.251825676871	I'm tested.
0.0	0.195838929335	We need to reverse that.
0.0	0.46463731397	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.336216039066	You know why three?
0.0	0.402773509213	But you know what, you can make a middle class wage, you have decent health care, decent benefits.
0.0	0.326682689617	And that's what this economy needs to -- that's what this debate needs to be about.
0.0	0.314294015227	Our rights come from God.
0.0	0.270166136393	They are more likely to know what's happening in their families and their communities, and they need to feel not just invited, but welcomed within the American society.
0.0	0.224298115012	I'm just saying.
0.0	0.322292327565	Let's talk about our campaigns.
0.0	0.0696415128846	There's -- look, there's --
0.0	0.437226389674	I am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of Vermont from very significant majorities of women.
0.0	0.311897339246	I'll suggest a part of that was his celebrity.
0.0	0.286622858474	That never works.
0.0	0.195603760299	It's not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.47151085862	That's wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country.
0.0	0.505267255688	China doesn't pay the tariff, the buyer pays the tariff.
0.0	0.335241659943	On the issue of Barack Obama, Barack Obama does not believe that America is a great global power.
0.0	0.504671201061	That is a dramatic tax decrease for hard-working people who run their own businesses.
0.0	0.369648296962	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.342403710254	We can make a stronger program.
0.0	0.315628422057	That will be my mission as president.
0.0	0.386295839652	Do we still have values and principles?
0.0	0.38102288778	It has to be based on what skills you have, what you can contribute economically, and most important of all, on whether or not you're coming here to become an American, not just live in America, but be an American.
0.0	0.357036560251	I would a whole lot rather had Carly Fiorina over there doing our negotiation than John Kerry.
0.0	0.199237662298	And, they're always going to say, "Well, we're going to fix this one day."
0.0	0.33335538879	We had Hamas.
0.0	0.434059011989	Chris Christie wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.37519047825	We will arm and train the Kurds.
0.0	0.50612696002	Since I was attacked too.
0.0	0.205571944121	He's wrong.

0.0	0.393859432317	But I knew that good people who wanted to be a part of the American dream have become trapped in dependency because the federal government and the state government had made it in their economic interest not to take a job because the benefits that they didn't work were better.
0.0	0.121380241586	I'm president -- look, I've done it once.

1.0	0.771770705227	You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don't agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements.
0.0	0.486324015316	This is a group of people that burns people in cages, that is conducting genocide against Christians and Yazidis and others in the region.

0.0	0.47468155408	I have been a strong ally with him on virtually every issue.
0.0	0.309715263591	But in 2008, we elected a president that didn't want to fix America.
0.0	0.373817713461	The fact is that there was a great effort made by the Obama administration and others to really send a clear message, because we knew that so many of these children were being abused, being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border.
0.0	0.359823563431	But the issue for us is to have a Congress that stands up and says not only no, but "Hell no" to this money going to a regime that is going to use it for terror, Susan Rice has said that, and we need to stand up and strongly and clearly tell the ayatollah that -- whoever the next president of the United States is going to be, and I'll promise you, if it's me, the first thing that I will do is tear up that agreement with Iran.
0.0	0.293164493731	So, we're going to enforce the law, we're going to change policing practices, we're going to change incarceration practices, but we're also going to emphasize education, jobs, and housing.

0.0	0.454587952925	You've seen middle-class wages go backwards $3,700 during the Obama administration.

0.0	0.303030934536	...Chris...
0.0	0.372524517832	But I would probably have my children run it with my executives and I wouldn't ever be involved because I wouldn't care about anything but our country, anything.
0.0	0.23564951251	Well, Neil, I'm glad we're focusing on the important topics of the evening.
0.0	0.376882308046	And as someone who's worn the uniform of the country, that's how we build our military back up.
0.0	0.30276892606	This is a great nation.
0.0	0.635477079792	And it costs, with dynamic scoring, less than a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.37340070656	But in the interim, in the absence of that, what's happening is some of these tech companies are taking those -- those centers (ph) to Canada because they can get people to go over there instead of here.

0.0	0.351874195686	Maria...
0.0	0.306742724036	We're going to be actually out there trying to create a better life for hard-working Americans.

0.0	0.206573111084	You've got to keep asking.
0.0	0.247446164204	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.361541288731	What this campaign is about is creating a process for a political revolution in which millions of Americans, working people who have given up on the political process, they don't think anybody hears their pains or their concerns.
0.0	0.350461321769	No, I didn't care (inaudible).

0.0	0.347213870776	How about talking about the substantive issues the people care about?
0.0	0.522850316244	It was the first time we did it since man walked on the moon.
1.0	0.654206401283	The blurb said that the next president of the United States has got to be aggressive in bringing people into the political process.
0.0	0.427759425398	We're going to combine all commercial activity in business into one place in the tax code and charge it 15 percent, which is going to suddenly make us competitive with the rest of the world.

0.0	0.446232866242	A law has been sitting -- languishing, sadly, on Capitol Hill and has not yet been passed, and it would help.
0.0	0.36719364297	Hillary Clinton cannot be president.
0.0	0.433760076128	And I would not support those.

0.0	0.537221568873	And, it turns out that up until -- and this has blown me away, never in a million years would I have believed that I would be standing here tonight telling you that we have received three and a half million individual contributions from well over a million people.
0.0	0.404422842195	And based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don't add up, and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now.
0.0	0.380595646217	If she gets elected, she's under investigation with the FBI right now.
0.0	0.311127950194	Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point?
0.0	0.428556589617	I have the experience as a prosecutor, attorney general, governor, United States Army intelligence veteran, governor during the 9/11 attack, chairman of the Terrorism Commission for this country.

0.0	0.589242238535	And therefore, they don't get the income tax break, but their prices are going to be higher, because the vat tax is embedded in both the prices that business that are charging and in the wages they pay their employees.
0.0	0.332148658608	It turns out some dot wasn't connected, and so the first thing we have to do is make sure that everyone and every responsible agency is attuned to all of these possibilities and symptoms.
0.0	0.429212867012	When I was 22, my dad died.
0.0	0.294545598956	Now, you've got Europe.

0.0	0.283049643769	That's absurd, and I think people who don't want to fix it, really, or unwilling to take the chance to say, "something has to change," are missing the boat here.
0.0	0.354264745105	(inaudible), the great majority of Republicans and Americans believe in a hopeful future.

0.0	0.210138491769	You know, I know to a lot of people in the media, this is just a great big game, and we're the players.
0.0	0.351188929767	If we want to create jobs for the folks that you're talking about, who are having trouble getting off government benefits, primarily because of their low skill level, there is no better way -- it's worked for 100 years in America -- putting people back to work in manufacturing is it.
0.0	0.454311861407	The worker's out of a job.

0.0	0.412744260925	That's gonna be the real growth engine.
0.0	0.409262984513	We should be relying upon the leadership of the Congress to pass the laws.
0.0	0.424850215692	They are radicalizing people in the United States, they are conducting attacks around the world.
0.0	0.335512954339	I promise.
0.0	0.405448690253	And -- and I would note indeed, the reason I said that is I was asked -- my friend Donald has taken to it as (ph) advance playing Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the USA", and I was asked what I thought of that.
0.0	0.396866478258	As a result of his efforts and the efforts of Joe Biden against unprecedented, I was there in the Senate, unprecedented Republican obstructionism, we have made enormous progress.
0.0	0.556079386898	And the last piece is this.
0.0	0.48000682253	In fact, if my mother were secretary of treasury, we would not be in a deficit situation.

0.0	0.267248100456	Well, I don't know.
0.0	0.480485314613	You'll create a much better graduation rate at a lower cost, and you won't in debt the next generation with recourse debt on their backs.
0.0	0.172245528458	We've got a president who instead says, we're going to change hearts and minds.
0.0	0.10495960496	Appreciate it.
0.0	0.360410294074	We need to get back to training people in this country to do the jobs of the 21st century.
0.0	0.419994800541	In all due respect, Secretary Clinton, a lot of the progressive groups, the online groups have really asked you a simple question.
0.0	0.355395989224	Now, I find it rather amazing, because I happen to believe that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country.
0.0	0.255104725763	But I think they will see a very good option here.
0.0	0.186494316967	I totally get that.
0.0	0.347531995999	One of them being that if you don't have some agreement within the system from states and from families and from students, it's hard to get to where we need to go.
0.0	0.594459507272	So beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given -- bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money.
0.0	0.336520400647	That tells you right away where he was headed on all of this.
0.0	0.446738932264	And, then we have to go after sentencing, and that's one of the problems here in Wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn't happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level.
0.0	0.38857537317	If I'm president of the United States and Congress tries to cut the military, I will veto that in a millisecond.
0.0	0.261841476177	They're absolutely false.
0.0	0.357897657068	We can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports gun control.

0.0	0.261726770617	Edward Snowden is a traitor.
0.0	0.363691161826	You can't send your troops into harm's way unless you give them every opportunity to be successful.
0.0	0.342190578104	I'm not talking about now, I'm talking about in the future they're building massive plants in China because China does not want Boeing building their planes here, they want them built in China, because China happens to be smart the way they do it, not the way we do it.
0.0	0.145685896372	Yes, I'm going to do away with that.
0.0	0.580252305317	A growth of 385,000 jobs.

0.0	0.443909421209	I never said that.
0.0	0.387549937981	But to destroy ISIS, it is necessary.
1.0	0.889143504754	And what that's led to over $2 trillion of American companies' monies that are being kept offshore, because they don't want to pay the second tax.
0.0	0.404048576004	I was governor on September 11th, and I'm proud of my leadership in bringing New York through that time.
0.0	0.415852233798	I will spend every ounce of energy to stop it.
0.0	0.348286526692	Crony capitalism is what happens when government gets so big and so powerful that only the big and the powerful can handle it.

0.0	0.680202176668	We'll tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money.

0.0	0.290186200759	You know, America doesn't owe me anything.
0.0	0.0901229354617	You know why?
0.0	0.218455680026	That's what I've always stood for.
0.0	0.497198695622	I was an Army intelligence agent and a veteran during the Cold War, assigned to West Germany.
0.0	0.342060373374	First, rather than expand benefits for everyone, I do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs.
0.0	0.387888349384	And there is no reason that you can't be perfectly fair to the gay community.
0.0	0.313329325671	Conservatives, I am a conservative because I believe no one of us is any better than any other one of us.
0.0	0.51882875691	One as a marine officer in Iraq, one as an army officer in Afghanistan.
0.0	0.455328761054	And the world's financial system is on the verge of collapse.
0.0	0.240383553372	Yes.
0.0	0.140014322956	We have to do something.
0.0	0.425555039131	The fact of the matter is he doesn't realize that we now live in the 21st century, and that war is very different than it used to be before.
0.0	0.320516269542	We're going to bring jobs and manufacturing back.
0.0	0.345504915523	We're going to have too many people in the cart rather than pulling the cart.
0.0	0.435179889846	And I just want to say, you know, last week we released our tax plan.
0.0	0.0430642640462	Thank you.
1.0	0.488238784194	Six million more people living in poverty than the day that Barack Obama got elected president, and the left just wants more of the same.
0.0	0.470650356499	... in addition to that, we go ahead and we take the oil from them, their source of revenue.
0.0	0.403025764011	A healthy environment, a strong economy and energy independent America -- that would be the purpose of my presidency, is break the strangle hold that people enjoy on fossil fuels who hate our guts.
0.0	0.375630394393	You did support a U.N. Security Council approach, which we did follow up on.
0.0	0.369410810853	Our greatest days lie ahead if we are willing to do what it takes now.
0.0	0.371803986069	And in your heart of hearts, you cannot wait to see a debate between Hillary Clinton and Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.471594435105	When we do business with China, they tax us.
0.0	0.335547759156	And I have many great Muslim friends.
0.0	0.233293281269	I mean, just think about a scenario like that.
0.0	0.302880749239	She'd be a great president of the United States because the leadership she brought to H.P.
0.0	0.398030860487	You know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in America.
0.0	0.422846147816	I was very honored to be asked to do that and very honored to serve with him those first four years.
0.0	0.437913006715	And that is what's so critical for our neighborhoods, our families, our children, and our grandchildren.
0.0	0.477515603343	You know, we could give you another example -- the Marines, the Army, these wonderful six soldiers that were killed.
0.0	0.382421148481	And just to finish, people say, how will you get Mexico to pay?
1.0	0.600480736443	In Florida, we have the lowest in-state tuition of any state, because there's accountability, just as John said.
0.0	0.161669161549	I like that.
0.0	0.297058570653	But here's the real key.
0.0	0.320781230424	And when I'm president, we're not just going to have a president that gives a State of the Union and says America is the greatest country in the world.
0.0	0.423816524202	If they had guns, he wouldn't be around very long.
0.0	0.228110714726	We're going to suspend -- I've -- I've said this for four years.
0.0	0.296885679802	Now, let me ask you a question everybody, and, this is for the guy, you know, who owns a landscaping business out there.
0.0	0.201383471187	So I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.204491779102	We're friends.
0.0	0.422693822959	We have Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view.
0.0	0.429457865457	We even had warnings about the Boston Marathon bombers, and yet the dots weren't connected.
0.0	0.100362479424	I have.
0.0	0.429103337503	Every one of us is gifted by God, whether it is those poor babies being picked over or it's someone whose life is tangled up in a web of dependence.
0.0	0.311251771947	Gronkowski is still going strong.
0.0	0.496348156836	Growth is the answer.
0.0	0.260795179123	And I want to make this our government.
0.0	0.222624560062	Look, the -- the deal is already done.
0.0	0.435907180444	I believe in government, but I believe in efficient government, not wasteful government.
0.0	0.428121294562	... an agreement with the...
0.0	0.298641215081	I used the laws of the country to my benefit, I'm sorry.
0.0	0.312806438625	Well, let's go with three.
0.0	0.440580458675	Simply expanding Medicaid does not improve health care outcomes.
0.0	0.411324408778	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.370194844122	I talked about Donald Trump from the standpoint of being an individual who was using his celebrity rather than his conservatism.
0.0	0.255387956705	It goes in the right direction.
0.0	0.324750339907	They do it to us, we don't it.
0.0	0.34643716377	The reason I did so well last time is not just because of the vision, it's because I have a track record in Washington, D.C. of getting things done.
0.0	0.443304907854	That's the side we need to be on, and that's the side of the bulk of the -- of the Middle East.
0.0	0.317598984583	You just have to look today at Indonesia, bombings all over.
0.0	0.403893749096	You also have to get rid of all the deductions and all the loopholes.
0.0	0.60650536667	President Obama's preparing to send $100 billion or more to the Ayatollah Khamenei.
0.0	0.451540241659	I'm the only person on this stage that actually was involved in the chief architect of balancing the Federal Budget.
0.0	0.330960811371	That's the establishment telling us to hide our conservative principles to get the left and the media to like us.
0.0	0.259016224924	But what he's touching -- talking about, I think has got merit.
0.0	0.237984726811	That's a blessing.
0.0	0.39098165315	The American people have rejected your agenda and now you're trying to go around it.
0.0	0.59423339389	You know, the NASDAQ dropped 80 percent -- 80 percent -- and it took 15 years for the NASDAQ to recover.
0.0	0.467040993138	You find me a Democrat -- you find me a Democrat that will cut spending ten dollars?
0.0	0.473534749629	And now after seven years of your policies, we have the biggest majority we've had since the 1920s in the House; a Republican majority in the Senate; and 31 out of 50 Republican governors.
0.0	0.403395872637	To talk about we're just gonna have a 10 percent tithe and that's how we're gonna fund the government?
0.0	0.258693487755	What have you got now?
1.0	0.791973182864	We have the world's best military, even though he's done everything he can to diminish it.
0.0	0.345104667088	We could do a whole show on that.
0.0	0.437959198771	SuperPacs are a disaster.
0.0	0.394965892338	The Koch Brothers have a very clear political agenda.
0.0	0.303310990831	I'm a Catholic, I believe life begins at conception.
0.0	0.370061799322	So, we are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we have to root out in our society.
0.0	0.438057129386	This is the first priority.
0.0	0.405098206587	The most mistreated people.
0.0	0.100362479424	...
0.0	0.33080951536	If you elect me president of the United States, I will secure that southern border.
1.0	0.297554343944	Believe me, that is why Ohio is doing well.
0.0	0.293091555594	That is the appropriate approach in order to get the results that you are seeking.
0.0	0.151989436316	But I want to go further.
0.0	0.218381161215	Because now he's going a little bit better.
0.0	0.350165422427	And if you elect me president, we will bring incredible growth back to this country.
0.0	0.343176687347	And also, I've been tested in a way no one else has.
0.0	0.420166082485	If you do that, you don't just change the economy, you transform the lives of millions of hurting Americans.
0.0	0.330479980798	We don't need to raise taxes to get this done.
0.0	0.400640637395	I am convinced that this president, if he could get rid of the Second Amendment, he would.
0.0	0.422017048179	It is broke, it is not working.
0.0	0.388031818592	You have to lead.
0.0	0.0901229354617	So you know what?
0.0	0.417062555075	Until we have a president of the United States that gets up every day and goes to the Oval Office with the intent purpose of securing that border, and there's not anybody on either one of these stages that has the experience of dealing with this as I have for over 14 years with that 1200-mile border.
0.0	0.145708235256	How great is that?
0.0	0.218011771762	-- the issue is who is going to get it done.
0.0	0.540768611713	You had two one hundred...
0.0	0.441162185132	Well, you just -- you just listed a litany of discredited attacks from Democrats and my political opponents, and I'm not gonna waste 60 seconds detailing them all.
0.0	0.145153121591	Alright.
0.0	0.100362479424	You did.
0.0	0.430045080059	And you shouldn't have mentioned the polls because I would have been much...
0.0	0.387744271223	We are trying to bring America together around an agenda that works for working families and the middle class.
0.0	0.383344273273	And the reason is simple: because in 2008, we elected as president someone who wasn't interested in fixing America.
0.0	0.341380047338	You don't solve it by big talk where you're banning all Muslims and making it harder for us to build the kind of coalition for us to be successful.
0.0	0.430590080015	Two quick responses.
0.0	0.37155894583	Marco Rubio, why don't you resign?
0.0	0.381128744336	And they got a killer in San Bernardino in posing as a fiance.
0.0	0.346633012189	I like Marco Rubio.
0.0	0.419444609589	We lose with ISIS.
0.0	0.378882247269	-- fix America, this is the formula.
0.0	0.293259298259	I say, yes, not only do we give them what they need, but we don't tie their hands behind their backs so that they can go ahead and get the job done.
0.0	0.170725222391	I'm very proud.
0.0	0.378120496355	The president doesn't understand -- and by the way, neither does Secretary Clinton -- and here's my warning to everybody out in the audience tonight.
0.0	0.246490980448	But my wife is down here in the front, and I'm sure, if you'd like to talk to her later, she can give you more than you'll ever be able to take care of.
0.0	0.420913350276	Big government favors the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected, and crushes the small and the powerless.
0.0	0.355237545207	And there should be some regulation.
0.0	0.313838309639	Maria, let me clear something up here.
0.0	0.611962278924	Last week in a CNN town hall, the Senator told a questioner that the questioner would spend about $500 dollars in taxes to get about $5,000 dollars in healthcare.
0.0	0.405845229572	Community- based businesses and farms are getting crushed.
0.0	0.557024822078	Well, first of all, we're running a $2 billion dollar surplus, we're not having a revenue problem right now.
0.0	0.477288342305	They attacked us in Philadelphia last week.
0.0	0.374161601491	I'm a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.494141472369	Do we still have standards?
0.0	0.100362479424	But...
0.0	0.293419626939	I will not shock anybody to suggest that in politics there is occasionally a little bit of hypocrisy.
1.0	0.61620033671	Mossadegh back in 1953.
0.0	0.413852757235	...eliminates the business...
0.0	0.522032751254	Even if it was a one percent chance, and it's far greater than one percent because (inaudible).
0.0	0.223365809062	We're not going to solve this problem with traditional politics.
0.0	0.466142925285	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.464185887126	He has never defended...
0.0	0.461354198566	Nothing has to change for current beneficiaries.
0.0	0.345143424465	We have a -- they say there's no bipartisanship in Washington?
0.0	0.22910549018	You know, the Russians wanted to buy time.
0.0	0.294053979347	But we are where we are right now.
0.0	0.355923559154	I mean, you have great constitutional lawyers that say you can't run.
0.0	0.411126616714	We have to do this in unison with the Arab world.
1.0	0.651655639407	It enabled him -- the president to certify them en masse without mandating meaningful background checks.
0.0	0.156773010316	And we need to very, very concerned about that.
0.0	0.271495094885	We have to stand with them.
0.0	0.201772614662	Folks, we've got to wake up.
0.0	0.204807741717	I frankly don't think there will be much change because I think what's going to happen is you're going to get more of the same.
0.0	0.463545082174	And that's what you'll hear from Hillary Clinton -- and I've already heard from her -- is that, send more money in Social Security, send more money in Medicare taxes, send more money for Medicaid, and that's gonna solve the problem.
0.0	0.144053478807	So I'm doing great.
0.0	0.392778628133	I laid out a plan at the Citadel to do just that and it starts with creating a "No Fly Zone" and "Safe Zones" to make sure refugees are there.
0.0	0.361521733638	Guaranteeing that women's work finally gets the pay, the equal pay that we deserve.
0.0	0.230063505105	And I want to just suggest to you.
0.0	0.408675596249	You think about it -- this is the president who said, along with his secretary of state -- drew a red line in Syria, said, if Assad uses chemical weapons against his people, that we're going to attack.
1.0	0.770307186631	Who denies that real unemployment today, including those who have given up looking for work and are working part-time is close to 10 percent?
0.0	0.461491507535	We should reimpose sanctions, they've already violated sanctions after this agreement was signed by testing medium-range missiles.
0.0	0.54751504824	In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense.
0.0	0.357086143111	And, that will get to the nub of opportunity for our children, and an ability to see wages rise.
0.0	0.472273823385	Those jobs, in many cases, are now gone.
0.0	0.269713833422	Well, it's an interesting question because I'm very proud of my company.
0.0	0.529959313919	For both of them you have to gradually raise the age.
0.0	0.557845675075	But when we talk about Wall Street, you have Wall Street and major banks have paid $200 billion in fines since the great crash.
0.0	0.462500709844	You just see the recent deal announced today or yesterday, more spending, more tax increasing, more regulation.
0.0	0.287052426037	It goes away.
0.0	0.357494759101	But let's be clear: Russia's aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO -- correctly, I believe -- are saying, you know what, we're going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action.
0.0	0.121445878804	They expect to have it.
0.0	0.381037200742	We both believe there has to be more money going into the Social Security system.
0.0	0.440097513293	And Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will say it's those evil rich people.
0.0	0.421545259603	And make sure you enhance savings in the private market.
0.0	0.365658891298	We need somebody ready to be commander-in-chief on day one, who understands there are no moderates in Iran, they've been killed a long time ago.
0.0	0.402201441629	Bernie Sanders, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.
0.0	0.383093204118	I believe this is still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.389805905608	That sounds like a long time ago.
0.0	0.4782628776	Or how about Boeing right here within a mile?
0.0	0.385920474115	I've heard them talk about deporting 10 or 11 -- people here from this country out of this country, splitting families.
0.0	0.467816700554	You know, these plans would put us trillions and trillions of dollars in debt.
0.0	0.189105427992	Creativity.
0.0	0.318043459559	... with what Marco is saying is that it takes too long, they're sucking us dry and it takes too long.
0.0	0.350243800252	So when Nikki said that, I wasn't offended.
0.0	0.335958293122	They are trying to attack us here in America.
0.0	0.37850826781	... on the issue of citizenship, Donald, I'm not going to use your mother's birth against you.
0.0	0.277455603022	And here in Wisconsin, I want to reiterate: We've got to stand up for unions and working people who have done it before...
0.0	0.289113163508	And -- and I just want to take this opportunity to say, you know, in the 2012 election, you know, we -- and when I say we, Republicans -- tore themselves apart.
1.0	0.838726821444	I vetoed a statewide I.D. system for gun owners and I pardoned, six out-of-state folks who came through our state and were arrested for owning a gun legally in another state so they never have to face charges.
0.0	0.268325337076	That sounds like people are afraid the president's going to take their guns away.
0.0	0.359975476369	... the best results, wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.315900329739	Bill, I want to say one more thing about...
0.0	0.275457395402	My parents in this country were able to give me the chance to do all the things they never did.
0.0	0.441250498328	Unfortunately, Governor Christie has endorsed many of the ideas that Barack Obama supports, whether it is Common Core or gun control or the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor or the donation he made to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.459624916454	We have arrived at a point in our nation's history where the potential of this nation and too many Americans is being crushed by the weight, the power, the cost, the complexity, the ineptitude, the corruption of the federal government, and only someone who will challenge the status quo of Washington, D.C. can lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.217348552779	I'm going to do what it takes to defend this nation.
0.0	0.252240668245	So, it's going to be my responsibility to make sure we move forward to solve these problems that are now out in the open.
0.0	0.172137327534	It turns out we knew something was wrong.
0.0	0.429252042947	And I would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country.
0.0	0.401284101275	But everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro- gay-marriage, focus around money and the media.
0.0	0.37776829738	But I -- the struggle of single moms is extraordinary.
0.0	0.402024622299	Well, listen, I've spent my entire life defending the Constitution before the U.S. Supreme Court.
0.0	0.400696406571	If you looking at what happened with Boeing and if you look at what happened with so many companies that deal -- so we don't have an equal playing field.
0.0	0.263908065203	I absolutely would call on them to collaborate and cooperate, yes.
0.0	0.341312421955	I do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination to succeed President Obama.
0.0	0.430477564273	That is not protected free speech.
0.0	0.353708580479	And listen, there are many, many wonderful, wonderful working men and women in the state of New York.
0.0	0.252731661112	What else we can do is that we should believe in science.
0.0	0.355224950479	It needs to be repealed and replaced.
0.0	0.478378954762	When he meets with the attorney general in the White House, it's not "how can we protect the Second Amendment rights of Americans."
0.0	0.214341326349	It's easier to talk to your friends.
0.0	0.369641502958	The cybersecurity challenges that we face, this administration failed us completely, completely.
0.0	0.368978460196	It is time for Republicans in D.C. to fight.

0.0	0.445518689075	And what is that proposal?
0.0	0.277848918612	And let me be clear.

0.0	0.333632249535	Well, first of all, like many other very big businessmen, I could name them here, but I'm not going to do that for a lot of obvious reasons, but the biggest, and almost all of them, they've all used the chapter laws, the bankruptcy laws to their own benefit.

0.0	0.497744662104	We're borrowing a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.378356947137	This is about people's lives, and we should level with the American people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare.

0.0	0.407204200525	One of your colleagues interviewed me.
0.0	0.279439819939	And I was going to tell you, whether I'm president or not, we better make it clear to the Saudis that we're going to support you, we're in relation with you just like we were in the first Gulf War, but you've got to knock off the funding and teaching of radical clerics who are the very people who try to destroy us and will turn around and destroy them.
0.0	0.403335722712	Our country rise up again, but we need to have a compelling conservative agenda that we present to the American people in a way that doesn't disparage people, that unites us around our common purpose.
0.0	0.443585976282	I am very proud, if my memory is not correct -- I think I am -- that I have a lifetime -- and I've been in Congress a few years -- a lifetime 100 percent pro-choice voting record.

0.0	0.333043911472	So look, corporations ought to exercise some responsibility.
0.0	0.54219073318	So let's start by knowing where your money is being spent by the federal government.
1.0	0.136973167249	It's not theirs anymore.
0.0	0.341909623598	We're going to bring jobs back from Japan, we're going to bring jobs back from China, we're going to bring, frankly, jobs back from Mexico where, as you probably saw, Nabisco is leaving Chicago with one of their biggest plants, and they're moving it to Mexico.
0.0	0.451153161056	But I do hope that in years to come, just as occurred with Cuba, 10, 20 years ago, people would say, reach normalized relations with Cuba.
0.0	0.372562680084	You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president...

0.0	0.338804501797	Well, I was pleased that NATO announced just this week that they're going to start doing patrols in the Mediterranean, in the Aegean, to try to interdict the smugglers, to try to prevent the kind of tragedies that we have seen all too often, also to try to prevent more refugees from coming to the European Union.
0.0	0.361689866338	No accomplishment.
0.0	0.302131004838	I propose to reverse that and get this economy moving again.
0.0	0.539684150989	-- living in extreme poverty is the highest level on record.
0.0	0.388764987968	Every election we talk about this.

0.0	0.303131797511	They didn't do that.
0.0	0.470149836654	I started the Gang of Seven, and it led to the overtaking of the 40-year Democratic rule of Congress, because I didn't -- I stood up to the old-boy network in Washington, D.C. because I believed that Washington was not the solution, that Washington was the problem, just like Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.390974034566	We have to continue to work with the Iraqi army so that they are better prepared to advance on some of the other strongholds inside Iraq, like Mosul, when they are able to do so.
0.0	0.426895487016	Hey, I'm in the United States Senate, and anyone who doesn't think that there is an enormous amount of waste and inefficiency and bureaucracy throughout government would be very, very mistaken.
0.0	0.524400535393	and they decide, we're going to raise it to 30 percent, plus we're going to raise the income tax to 30 percent.
0.0	0.269430087737	And for the life of me, I have no understanding why the president thinks that everything is going well.
0.0	0.384936873263	Now, since September, the Constitution hasn't changed.
0.0	0.51431040633	And I would note the Senate just a few weeks ago voted to suspend refugees from Middle Eastern countries.
0.0	0.39659981351	Well, let's just -- let's just follow up on this, because, you know, I've made it very clear that no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail, and because of Dodd-Frank, we now have in law a process that the president, the Federal Reserve, and others can use if any bank poses a systemic risk.

0.0	0.426589556613	John Kasich, will you insult two people over here?
0.0	0.534298949956	But if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things, including corporate taxes, and including the capital gains taxes, you make that amount up pretty quickly.
0.0	0.405214557994	But judgment matters as well.

0.0	0.211507062148	I'm happy to answer the question...
0.0	0.0901229354617	And you know what?
0.0	0.244082359673	Let em also tell you...
0.0	0.275855631503	I do not see -- want to see one parent or loved one worrying about getting a call in the middle of the night.
0.0	0.394896107448	I've watched to see people say that we should dismantle Medicare and Medicaid and leave the senior citizens out -- out in the -- in the cold.
0.0	0.271781016785	The D.C. politicians continue to make things worse.
0.0	0.247828749835	I have no illusion.
0.0	0.425175072296	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.240383553372	Yes.
0.0	0.185815158438	They're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.326340444508	And that doesn't have to be true.
0.0	0.359289184041	That's a dictatorship.
0.0	0.483920538172	There is no money in the Social Security account.
0.0	0.346972929554	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.369895389293	My dad was a bartender, my mother was a maid.
0.0	0.375623615879	She wants to continue down the path of Iran, Benghazi, the Russian reset, Dodd-Frank, all the things that have -- that have gone wrong in this country, she would be a national security mess.
0.0	0.518416344742	This is a group of people that enslaves women and sells them, sells them as brides.
0.0	0.243881057645	I got that.
0.0	0.195515587029	You have got to pick somebody who has experience, somebody that has the know-how, the discipline.
0.0	0.25338883657	And I have the feeling you're going to find a lot of cost overruns there and a lot of waste and duplicative activities.
0.0	0.404037334917	They get them on the black market.
1.0	0.434166118675	I've used it three times, maybe four times.
0.0	0.412814881786	We took it away from the NSA, it was a bad decision by the president.
0.0	0.402239782323	We have not provided them.
0.0	0.302064724225	We need to be focusing on what fixes this country.
0.0	0.450396872374	I understand both of these issues, how to build the economy and doing that as a governor who'd built jobs, had cut taxes and also a governor who understands foreign-policy, and that's why I entered this race.
0.0	0.392344520952	I mean, she would drive a car until it wouldn't make a sound, and then gather up all her coins and buy a new car.
0.0	0.225359088545	I've got the backbone, I've got the band width, I've got the experience to get us through this.
0.0	0.319738951598	If you're running for president of the United States and you do not understand that we cannot defend this nation without more of our soldiers over there, you are not ready for this job.
0.0	0.408468625204	We can't afford another four years of that.
1.0	0.835132109299	And yet they are seeing almost all new income and all new wealth going to the top 1 percent.
0.0	0.194531084034	A lot of interesting issues have come together.
0.0	0.365999677283	Without China, North Korea doesn't even eat.
0.0	0.368556517919	Look, the truth is that a powerful nation like the United States, certainly working with our allies, we can overthrow dictators all over the world.
0.0	0.528805961238	A flat tax for everybody -- no exemptions, no deductions, no shelters, because some people have a better capability of taking advantage of those than others.
0.0	0.334870601416	We are not the world's policeman, but we need to stand up and be ready.
0.0	0.222397612147	It's harder to talk to your enemies.
0.0	0.353216911598	Then you have to get rid of Larry Kudlow, who sits on your panel, who's a great guy, who came out the other day and said, I love Trump's tax plan.
0.0	0.463516660337	Alzheimers, diabetes, heart disease and cancer.
0.0	0.272095439845	They will -- some will follow.
0.0	0.154691686543	You find me...
0.0	0.245599303103	The fact of the matter is we're not going to have peace -- we are not going to have peace in Syria.
0.0	0.464320654486	We have 30,000 fewer state bureaucrats than the day I took office.
0.0	0.394037997727	... first of all, let me just tell you something -- and you know, because you just saw the numbers yourself -- NBC Wall Street Journal just came out with a poll -- headline: Trump way up, Cruz going down.
0.0	0.512795907837	There is one major country -- the United States -- which ends up spending almost three times per capita what they do in the U.K. guaranteeing health care to all people, 50 percent more than they do in France guaranteeing health care to all people, far more than our Canadian neighbors, who guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.357236356467	I didn't inherit any money.
0.0	0.402728808842	America was worth the wait.
0.0	0.271696427893	Let me just -- just say this.
0.0	0.423662429714	If you take donations from Wall Street, you can't be independent.
1.0	0.912521012485	We had a $1.4 trillion deficit.
0.0	0.44542818804	I don't think you expand entitlements when so many people are dependent on government and when the money the federal government is offering is going to be taken away from you after just a couple of years.
0.0	0.325263602992	We had Hezbollah.
0.0	0.472594117458	Half of them had tears pouring down their face.
0.0	0.371832402362	They built the great wall of China.
0.0	0.338403382772	And so that was his explanation.
0.0	0.694563221064	We cut taxes and we had a $5 trillion projected surplus when I left.
0.0	0.195363128293	That's what I said.
0.0	0.211063354814	They get -- they steal them.
0.0	0.472493020706	He is not the only one.
0.0	0.472097902205	That cost gets passed on to the people.
0.0	0.280350999657	That's what I've done in Louisiana, that's what I'll do in America.
0.0	0.494733470451	And remember this, after Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have had nearly 8 years, we have fewer democracies in the world than we had when they started.
0.0	0.387069450337	We need to incent private savings and make sure that Social Security is protected for those that have it.
0.0	0.369000737564	This guy is a petulant child.
0.0	0.51607877418	We have a $19 trillion bipartisan debt and it continues to grow as we borrow money from countries that do not like us to pay for government we cannot afford.
0.0	0.371653463147	You know, you go to the internet, you start reading an article and you go to the comments section -- you cannot go five comments down before people are calling each all manner of names.
0.0	0.17098063898	Not everybody remembers that.
0.0	0.443162829783	If I'm the nominee, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.100362479424	No.
0.0	0.34612636832	And, we have a government and leaders in government that are completely out of touch, and that's why I'm running for president.
0.0	0.38681161977	And that's what we should focus on is the violence in our communities.
0.0	0.326052706432	But it doesn't change my view that we need to empower everyone, women and men, to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make.
0.0	0.302876467936	One principle, for example, we've got to embrace is on immigration.
0.0	0.436594303218	And women have been disadvantaged ever since.
0.0	0.226754990989	I've got one more question for you then.
0.0	0.417218623266	That's why I ask for your support for president.
0.0	0.290852592447	If we do that again, we will lose again, we will deserve to lose again.
0.0	0.419243479788	Marco stood with Chuck Schumer and Barack Obama on amnesty.
0.0	0.452230203767	You do legislation.
0.0	0.355150452266	He is undermining our standing in the world.
0.0	0.512765994827	The planes are older than the pilots.
0.0	0.160366010846	I think he is right.
0.0	0.321778194452	I love this country.
0.0	0.490014480512	It's now half the size of what it was prior to Operation Desert Storm.
0.0	0.408408533289	And that problem is too big regulations like the EPA, too much new taxes on business that we have seen and "Obamacare."
0.0	0.210270284724	I'll tell you what else people are concerned about.
0.0	0.374801936746	But the ideal scenario is to train Americans to do the work so we don't have to rely on people from abroad.
0.0	0.501977702585	We've saved billions of dollars.
0.0	0.472254857658	Madam Secretary, that is a low blow.
0.0	0.431584526342	I put together the coalition that imposed the sanctions on Iran that got us to the negotiating table to put a lid on their nuclear weapons program.
0.0	0.343233050502	I will, with your help and support, lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.47053198829	The other issue is mental health.
0.0	0.206193241554	We need a doer, not a talker.
0.0	0.393778776292	But I have no argument with anyone making up her mind about who to support.
0.0	0.275633593173	I find -- I mean, it's just a very different, you know, historical perspective here.
0.0	0.387898376682	They have to come into this country legally.
0.0	0.363302592273	We should be deporting criminals, not hardworking immigrant families who do the very best they can and often are keeping economies going in many places in our country.
0.0	0.421129792287	Here's the bottom line.
0.0	0.100362479424	No their not.
0.0	0.44259858899	We're a country of laws, Bill.
0.0	0.370313148654	Here's -- here's our plan.
0.0	0.345744104703	But I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost.
0.0	0.371455697342	Because the more you tax something, the less of it you get.
0.0	0.460820776994	That is the way to deal with China at the end of the day.
0.0	0.351913446355	And that's the way my parents came legally in 1956.
0.0	0.498172063725	But for that Texas police officer, we could have had a mass murder.
0.0	0.240383553372	Yes.
0.0	0.37083239074	But, by the way, when it comes to a woman having to make a very personal choice, ah, in that case, my Republican colleagues love the government and want the government to make that choice for every woman in America.
0.0	0.351146717051	And when we live by those laws and we treat everybody equally under the law, that's when people feel good about being Americans.
0.0	0.295830807243	I would begin by saying that I'm not sure it's a weakness, but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for America's future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people.
0.0	0.44428836891	Number one, you have people in this country that...
0.0	0.212609074676	I'll check for you.
0.0	0.254173613505	Play by the rules.
0.0	0.318787813688	That, I think, between the two of us demonstrates the strength of the support we have among people who want to see change in our country.
0.0	0.362012078571	I suspect you may have.
0.0	0.431194682759	Someone's going to be collecting this tax.
0.0	0.369346727506	We had Iran putting operatives in South America and Central America.
0.0	0.312395884279	Not a very pleasant place to be.
0.0	0.346472434087	It's all about getting people to listen to one another's problems.
0.0	0.409801681324	John, I -- if I -- a lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.334987469517	They're taking money from Social Security and they're going to spend it on the military and they're going to spend it on domestic spending.
0.0	0.330686012375	Let me tell you who Larry Tribe is.
0.0	0.373638712452	Well, first of all, recognize it is a substantial problem.
0.0	0.238000747143	I love China.
0.0	0.169821854314	That's all I'm saying.
0.0	0.411465783175	After the war we had all of these kids, Baby Boomers.
0.0	0.309819704021	And you had better get rid of them, because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.132021685849	That's not right.
0.0	0.319403243179	I think now what I've called for is counsel for every child so that no child has to face any kind of process without someone who speaks and advocates for that child so that the right decision hopefully can be made.
0.0	0.403686075306	I think what President Obama did was to exemplify the importance of this issue as our first African American president, and to address it both from the President's office, and through his advocacy, such as working with young men, and Mrs. Obama's work with young women.
0.0	0.31961506094	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.100362479424	We do.
0.0	0.3523029361	What -- what -- you're from New York?
0.0	0.444409338211	... that after the 9/11 attacks, Secretary Rumsfeld invited me to the Pentagon with a meeting of the former secretaries of Defense.
0.0	0.253424405997	It is absolutely absurd to say that I had any kind of a relationship with them.
1.0	0.404249932326	They stole it.
0.0	0.218007700696	Not the change we need at a time we need it.
0.0	0.380345375409	My four children have been able to receive a good Christian education, and I've been able to save for them to go to college so they never have to have the loans that I did.
0.0	0.288037020815	That's my view.
0.0	0.340599710545	They know that this country is not respected around the world anymore.
0.0	0.330499709309	And then we need to shut down -- we need to shut down their mechanisms of funding and attack their command-and-control centers.
0.0	0.39641745708	He was on the board.
0.0	0.409742402984	And we should back up the recent donors conference to make sure we have made our contribution to try to deal with the enormous cost that these refugees are posing to Turkey and to members of the E.U.
0.0	0.413191816537	Every penny we needed from -- every penny we got from Social Security, because my sister was a minor, we needed.
0.0	0.361163949854	I am deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.444742355779	Well, first off, let's face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.361344329413	And you're not serious about destroying ISIL.
0.0	0.329143567181	I'm also going to take a bottle of White-Out with me to get started on all those executive orders that Mr. Obama has put his name to.
0.0	0.452533040425	If you saw that blimp that got cut loose from Maryland today, it's a perfect example of government.
0.0	0.447263054294	Why in God's name does Wall Street make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.197745239195	You can have him.
0.0	0.241741210252	We just want to be the rich."
0.0	0.400391268413	I mean the fact is, is that they need to put the pressure on and frankly we need to intercepts ships coming out of North Korea so they don't proliferate all these dangerous materials.
0.0	0.384758017685	Well, they're the ones not listening to the scientists today, because doctors say that at 20 weeks that is a viable life inside the womb.
0.0	0.369115051276	And it's available on paperback, if you're interested in buying my book.
0.0	0.446872438598	I do not believe a vote in 2002 is a plan to defeat ISIS in 2016.
0.0	0.343519947625	Someone who's going to stand up, and be very clear with our enemies as to the lines their going to draw and stand with them.
0.0	0.387601378987	I have seen him appoint people to our courts not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.193281523474	We need to get realistic about this.
0.0	0.404750046842	We cannot be the world's policeman.
0.0	0.403230525007	We have ISIS and al Qaeda attacking us.
0.0	0.603570663812	Our average contribution is $27 dollars, I'm very proud of that.
0.0	0.39312714303	Well, I'll tell you something: you can take everything from the top 1 percent, and you apply it to our fiscal gap, and you won't even make a dent in it.
0.0	0.100362479424	No, you did.
0.0	0.355104896364	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
1.0	0.773023158662	They were wrong.
0.0	0.36128997759	We need to arm the Kurds the directly.
0.0	0.330562210568	We bailed them out.
0.0	0.394005371884	You target the bad guys.
0.0	0.165792808356	But I guess I'm supposed to come out great.
0.0	0.39148338517	I like Chris Christie, but we can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports Common Core.
0.0	0.244584653082	It's got great people, it's got loving people, wonderful people.
0.0	0.430894866359	We're on the verge of being the first generation of Americans that leave our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.407688501103	I want to find out why those two young people -- those two horrible young people in California when they shot the 14 people, killed them -- people they knew, people that held the wedding reception for them.
0.0	0.301169056922	I'm asking people to support me because I think I'm the most qualified, experienced, and ready person to be the president and the commander- in-chief.
0.0	0.547825728934	Any connection maybe to the fact that our people pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs?
0.0	0.296779963983	Probably, I don't know -- you people write the stuff.
0.0	0.393338533988	I can't speak for the Koch Brothers, you're referring to a Super PAC that we don't coordinate with, that was set up to support President Obama, that has now decided that they want to support me.
0.0	0.392861728924	But if you want someone who has a proven, effective leadership, that was a governor of a state, that transformed the culture there, elect me so I can fight for the American people and change the culture in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.260050053668	It's time for us to stand up for what we believe in.
0.0	0.452483804068	One thing I like to remind people is, back in 2007, Rudy Giuliani was leading the polls for almost a year.
0.0	0.385941756365	But what happened is a political vacuum developed.
0.0	0.422347803239	It was LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations in this country.
0.0	0.373339555304	Which is what we're gonna get if we elect a big government liberal like Hillary Clinton to the White House.
0.0	0.335988084607	... and I know Bernie, and I can promise you he's not going to be president of the United States.
0.0	0.243090206809	If you want someone who's not going to divide Washington, but gets things done, then you should make me your president.
0.0	0.473832387217	The New York Times a few weeks back had a columnist who wrote a column saying, "Anybody But Cruz."
0.0	0.3209122462	They come from another country and they're immediately sent out.
0.0	0.584656975052	When I left the workforce, New York State had been reduced by over 15 percent.
0.0	0.29479194993	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.408290533569	And nobody, nobody on either one of these stages has done more than I've done and the people of the State of Texas to deal with securing that border.
0.0	0.132021685849	That is not right.
0.0	0.420418649611	Because they're recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees.
0.0	0.455022580619	I've set forth very specific plans about how to get costs down, especially prescription drug costs.
0.0	0.263010250949	Let people play, who cares?
0.0	0.404314389514	I am against the raids.
0.0	0.433205091726	Well, he appointed Eric Holder as attorney general.
0.0	0.370266671341	So let's demand open trade but fair trade in this country.
1.0	0.780633550799	And the reason I said that is because the FBI director told the American people, told Congress, that he could not guarantee he could vet them and it would be safe.
0.0	0.380138528829	And then the Government steps in to try and solve the problem and we get a little further down to that progressive vision that Hillary Clinton is talking about.
0.0	0.424981710245	No one here is under FBI investigation.
0.0	0.435386267328	And he was a managing general partner.

0.0	0.380725573712	If I am president of the United States, we're going to send soldiers back to Iraq, back to Syria, to keep us from being attacked here and keep soldiers in Afghanistan because we must.
0.0	0.296478083085	We need a unifier, not a cynical divider in chief, and that's exactly what I will do.
0.0	0.194860012546	Well, I've learned the rules on this.
0.0	0.385258425984	This president every chance he has ever gotten has tried to undermine the Second Amendment.

0.0	0.162975252512	No, that's -- you're wrong.
0.0	0.100362479424	So...
0.0	0.275515838688	And -- and I guess I can -- can frame it another way.

0.0	0.249200397263	Well, I'm very happy to get a question this early on.

0.0	0.0901229354617	And you know what?
0.0	0.355104896364	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.

0.0	0.312786507975	I find it very, very hard to forgive people that deceived me.
0.0	0.31657604856	I think the times are different now.
0.0	0.386112073381	My program would move the 104 programs of the federal Department of Education into four block grants, and send them back to the states because income inequality is driven by a lack of skills when kids don't get what they need to be able to compete and win in this country.

0.0	0.54650600425	... and here's the critical point, Maria -- the business flat tax enables us to abolish the corporate income tax, the death tax, the Obamacare taxes, the payroll taxes, and they're border-adjustable, so every export pays no taxes whatsoever.
0.0	0.42492193485	But Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term, and you should be showing up to work.
0.0	0.231614607374	And I'm not blaming these folks -- well, I guess I could.
0.0	0.442960702256	I believe that we need to cut these taxes down, we need to be on a roadmap to balancing the budget, and we need to send power, money, and influence, the welfare department, the education department, job training, infrastructure, Medicaid, all of that out of Washington back to the states so we can run these programs from where we live to the top, not a one size fits all mentality that they have in Washington.
0.0	0.428491386593	You know how many votes John McCain missed when he was carrying out that furious comeback that you're now modeling after?
0.0	0.387808434247	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.350907657926	That's the way it should be, and I'm going to continue to reach out to thank all my online contributors for everything they are doing for me, to encourage them and help me do more just as Senator Sanders is.

0.0	0.405072468407	I want to ask you: Are you fed up with how Washington taxes you?
0.0	0.382398701422	Regulations in this country are out of control, especially the Employment Prevention Agency, the EPA, and all of the rules they continue to impose on our economy and hurting us.
0.0	0.291154758226	They can't even make a deal.
0.0	0.45663225945	If my memory is correct, I think when we saw children coming from these horrendous, horrendously violent areas of Honduras and neighboring countries, people who are fleeing drug violence and cartel violence, I thought it was a good idea to allow those children to stay in this country.
0.0	0.318268149992	But you haven't asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought I'd get that off my chest if you don't mind.

0.0	0.322455933357	This is the fantasy that I talked about in the beginning.
0.0	0.460988572141	I have a concrete plan to do just that, which allows people to keep HSAs to encourage savings, it allows for people that are retiring with Social Security to be able to get a minimum of 125 percent of the poverty level so that there is a baseline that in this generous country of ours no one goes below.
0.0	0.46988672295	But nobody can deny that as a wartime leader, he rallied the British people when they stood virtually alone against the Nazi juggernaut and rallied them and eventually won an extraordinary victory.
0.0	0.287885114592	That is not what America should be about.
0.0	0.429655548625	And it troubles me that people are rewarded for tearing down our country.
0.0	0.387360615189	And the problem today is there's no confidence in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.455723434118	Are you concerned like I am that the debt and deficits of Washington, D.C. are endangering America's future?
0.0	0.418818544947	I far prefer that and the chances we have to be successful there than trying to start all over again, gridlocking our system, and trying to get from zero to 100 percent.
0.0	0.369642123	Martha, we got a lot of politicians that will kiss babies, cut ribbons, do whatever it takes to be popular.
0.0	0.439471274416	I would just say, I debated then Senator Obama numerous times on stages like this, and he was the recipient of the largest number of Wall Street donations of anybody running on the Democratic side ever.
0.0	0.421382051009	Listen, we -- this is the greatest country in the history of mankind.
0.0	0.564676816985	It is imposed on business and a critical piece that Marco seems to be missing is that this 16 percent business flat tax enables us to eliminate the corporate income tax.
0.0	0.45071685962	I've seen so much of it - a Soviet Union, the coming down of a wall, the issues that we saw around the world in Central America, the potential spread of communism, and 9/11 and Gulf War.
0.0	0.325954154864	Oh yeah, we want to elect a good president, but America is great from the bottom-up, and the bottom-up is us in our families, in our communities, in our neighborhoods.
0.0	0.448022929191	We have to support the fighters on the ground, principally the Arabs and the Kurds who are willing to stand up and take territory back from Raqqa to Ramadi.
0.0	0.27950903463	Well, look, I think that she's been saying that for as long as I've known her, which is about 25 years.
0.0	0.340887876746	I'm not anti-Wall Street, but I don't believe the government ought to wear a team jersey, pick winners and losers.
0.0	0.395183129042	But I recall when Secretary Clinton ran against then-Senator Obama, she was critical of him for suggesting that maybe you want to talk to Iran, that you want to talk to our enemies.
1.0	0.528067719883	And I know this, because when I ran for governor of New York, one in 11 of every man, woman, and child in the state of New York was on welfare.
0.0	0.427139545036	He's a major Hillary Clinton supporter.
0.0	0.394992866748	You know, I have two sons.
0.0	0.306160631242	We just can't do it any longer.
0.0	0.366301824425	You know I understand why Donald made the comments he did and I understand why Americans are feeling frustrated and scared and angry when we have a president who refuses to acknowledge the threat we face and even worse, who acts as an apologist for radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.610867076792	The main problem with Medicare right now is that the average person pays in taxes over their whole lifetime about $100,000.
0.0	0.262247789788	They are not perfect.
0.0	0.3514300011	And that's why this study, which shows that if you can believe it today, for white working class people between 45 and 54, life expectancy is actually going down.
0.0	0.238365079466	So I just truly, with all my heart belief, I like everybody on the stage.
0.0	0.370822311537	...This is a matter not of math, this is a matter of morality.
0.0	0.244530959263	So yeah, someone who makes more money...
1.0	0.743483594103	Everybody voted for it wanting to see Libya move toward democracy, of course we all wanted to do that.
0.0	0.283335524097	Well, when you look at the celebrity of Donald Trump, then I think that says a lot about it.
0.0	0.270399514899	You know, she only had a third-grade education, but -- you know, she knew how to stretch a dollar.
0.0	0.373681818756	I agree, however, it doesn't go far enough, because what it focuses on are the big banks, which Senator Sanders has talked about a lot, for good reason.
0.0	0.451554023177	Not all of his top national security advisors agreed with that.
0.0	0.362793801658	He got endorsed by the Sun-Sentinel because he was the most talented guy in the field.
0.0	0.329947115818	We have to get the remaining 10.
0.0	0.335736789679	And so it was (inaudible) his statement, which is why I'm asking him to consider changing his views.
0.0	0.552038848545	You know how much money we spent on polio last year in America?
0.0	0.303529401179	We're going to cut Social Security to help you.
0.0	0.250987003578	In fact, we need to -- wait a minute -- we need vigilance.
0.0	0.2654006281	We're going to fight it as hard as we can, and we're going to fight whoever the Republicans nominate who will depend on the Koch Brothers, and others.
0.0	0.40376671155	Now I think an area in kind of a vague way, or not so vague, where Secretary Clinton and I disagree is the area of regime change.
0.0	0.46731665111	That is not consistent conservatism, that is political calculation.
0.0	0.269342516781	I don't -- look, I don't think anybody should be expanding Medicaid.
0.0	0.345538522304	But honestly, if you're a small business owner today you are being crushed.
0.0	0.429418860153	There is a bill sitting in the House that would actually pass and have us go to zero-based budgeting so we know where every dime of your money is being spent instead of only talking about how much more we're going to spend year after year after year.
0.0	0.224731230221	And, you know, we have a whole variety of things that they can do and they can do these things simultaneously.
0.0	0.483471390446	I had to answer every single question about every single result and every single projection in public until there were no more questions.
0.0	0.428442767586	I changed that.
0.0	0.168818818983	Well, you're talking about -- yeah.
0.0	0.331131304405	And this president, given what Ted said right at the beginning, he's absolutely right.
0.0	0.448346983928	But Maria, radical Islamic terrorism was not invented 24 months ago; 24 months ago, we had Al Qaida.
0.0	0.417053505418	This isn't the governments money.
0.0	0.288168064644	Freedom is personal for me, and I will always keep my word and fight for freedom.
0.0	0.428693804336	So you know, I had to report results every 90 days in excruciating detail.
0.0	0.29746557139	Yes, it's very simple.
0.0	0.219485586865	You know, that's so simple.
0.0	0.404774756733	Our healthcare is a horror show.
0.0	0.370017428742	Here's a fact.
1.0	0.827197116884	If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world -- and we double tax, as you know.
0.0	0.31940083155	I want to tackle those barriers that stand in the way of too many Americans right now.
0.0	0.353976997473	Maria, Neil, thank you for a great debate tonight.
0.0	0.384708100559	And I took on the drug companies and I took on the insurance companies to try to get us universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.423190529312	Why does the pharmaceutical industry make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.452330031003	I think they made the Second Amendment the second amendment because they thought it was just that important.
0.0	0.412472973795	He appointed Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, someone who has been a radical against the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.
0.0	0.269418986662	Well, I did.
0.0	0.309412679149	I've created tens of thousands of jobs, and in all due respect -- and actually some of these folks I really like a lot -- but I'm the only one that can say that.
0.0	0.347045525741	And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word.
0.0	0.331547506835	So I have voiced criticisms.
0.0	0.356233257099	Really systemic racism in this state, as in others, education, in employment, in the kinds of factors that too often lead from a position where young people, particularly young men, are pushed out of school early, are denied employment opportunities.
0.0	0.394973776805	My name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.393496522181	People have worked their entire lives.
0.0	0.322157324471	We have to put more money.
0.0	0.421581227017	I just want to thank all my colleagues here for being civil, and not falling for the traps.
0.0	0.360658155727	We have no borders.
0.0	0.486931524323	You're looking at the -- at the man who introduced and fought on the floor as a freshman senator and passed the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 over two President Clinton vetoes.
0.0	0.484021315851	When millions of Americans rose up against Obamacare, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.33630190749	We will rebuild the military to make sure that it is a solid force, not to be the world's policeman, but to make sure that in a peaceful world, people know that the United States is there to take care of our own national interests and take care of our allies.
0.0	0.365152950354	So it wasn't just me who opposed it.
0.0	0.339366017953	The questions that are being asked shouldn't be trying to get people to tear into each other.
0.0	0.336216039066	You know why three?
0.0	0.301378069516	And our economy was growing like crazy.
0.0	0.447147513996	Three pages is about the maximum that a single business owner or a farmer or just a couple can understand without hiring somebody.
0.0	0.337663279204	You know, I listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas.
0.0	0.345486106531	The first thing is we have to strengthen our alliances around the world.
0.0	0.322462429326	It's a -- it's absolutely disgraceful that Secretary Kerry and others said in their response to what's going on in Iran that this was a good thing; it showed how the relationship was getting better.
0.0	0.227303833125	John, I'll tell you something.
0.0	0.296201752859	I don't care.
0.0	0.4608818141	African-Americans who face discrimination in the job market, education, housing, and the criminal justice system.
0.0	0.303364898773	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.263872935355	While there are lots of good ideas for reform, we have never tackled the basics.
0.0	0.256178580684	But, what we did is we said to the working families of this country, look, we know things are tough, but if you want to help us go beyond establishment politics, and establishment economics, send us something.
0.0	0.412990531693	No, I said, " I would use -- " they were asking me what to do about North Korea.
0.0	0.336718175274	He wants to change America.
0.0	0.332122176572	The economy was really booming.
0.0	0.448406906904	Well, I wish you would have asked that question years ago when they broke it.
0.0	0.453111937917	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.447026158383	I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King.
0.0	0.377087807806	Absolutely, because what we will do is say, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so they're not hanging out on street corners.
0.0	0.369680438277	We have been debating right here the core difference between conservatism and progressivism.
0.0	0.428379929963	Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well.
0.0	0.443746283222	But realistically, even if they do, the money is flowing.
0.0	0.30344916349	Not bad.
0.0	0.329774168078	So, we're talking about -- we're talking about reform for people like me and people like Senator Cruz, as he talked about earlier, who are years away from retirement that have a way to plan for these changes, and way that's very reasonable.
0.0	0.417509739595	Where the secretary and I have a very profound difference, in the last debate -- and I believe in her book -- very good book, by the way -- in her book and in this last debate, she talked about getting the approval or the support or the mentoring of Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.407396802279	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.25998147131	So we need new leadership -- yes.
0.0	0.503641141973	No criminal records for them.
0.0	0.289764652914	...we need to honor our promises...
0.0	0.411775870634	And, you know the old inscription, if you save one life, you've changed the world.
0.0	0.180126919466	You're simply not.
0.0	0.395090353191	But we have a serious problem.
0.0	0.30864885313	The way to take that away from them is to talk to our military officials and ask them, "what do you need in order to accomplish this goal?"
0.0	0.30242177947	You know, I think my biggest weakness is exactly the opposite.
0.0	0.471269945303	They are refusing to...
0.0	0.446464695016	Today, we have a legal immigration system for permanent residency that is largely based on whether or not you have a relative living here.
0.0	0.302889169814	They're making a half, two-thirds what they used to make.
0.0	0.320000098106	There's no way he launches 11 attack --
0.0	0.388610545266	If a person lives in a seven room house, does the government get to say you don't need seven rooms, we're going to take two of them away?
0.0	0.488422070509	In fact, it's the chief argument by democrats against many of the different flat tax proposals.
0.0	0.327573999397	Excuse me, John.
0.0	0.267929115181	Well, Senator, look, I think we're in vigorous agreement here.
0.0	0.389201266741	My point is this.
1.0	0.763662317806	And in Libya, for example, the United States, Secretary Clinton, as secretary of state, working with some other countries, did get rid of a terrible dictator named Gadhafi.
0.0	0.31102197199	You can campaign, or just resign and let someone else take the job.
0.0	0.243614953009	How do we decide on who gets to follow up?
0.0	0.474690555062	And when America does not lead, the world is a dangerous and a tragic place.
0.0	0.406775067039	Neil, my name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.259906882961	They are -- they're in a position where they're smothering people.
0.0	0.459620750964	You know, 200 years ago, America was founded on this powerful principle that our rights don't come from government.
0.0	0.448415063981	Look, the Second Amendment is not an option.
0.0	0.163245925928	We hear a lot of good plans.
0.0	0.305843115435	There is no other description of it.
0.0	0.48635629234	He used chemical weapons, he's killed, now, over a quarter of a million of his own people, and this president has done nothing.
0.0	0.440450864837	And specifically, we know that we could have detected and repelled some of these cyber attacks if that collaboration had been permitted.
0.0	0.279529837039	Well, John, I don't really have any weaknesses that I can think of.
0.0	0.152983851659	Let me say on that...
0.0	0.332826743402	He doesn't meet -- here's the difference.
1.0	0.871781565491	My price tag is about $100 billion a year.
0.0	0.317293813003	Here, we actually need 1,000 because we have natural barriers.
0.0	0.42653140558	Their family is waiting for them.
0.0	0.437346372683	What we should do is to be investing in all types of energy, John, all types of energy.
0.0	0.330253157537	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the Constitution.
0.0	0.413980365523	Planned Parenthood had better hope that Hillary Clinton wins this election, because I guarantee under President Jindal, January 2017, the Department of Justice and the IRS and everybody else that we can send from the federal government will be going in to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.299985557714	You can't have a question.
0.0	0.232510721431	They don't want them made here.
0.0	0.378556763914	In my view, it doesn't go anywhere near far enough.
0.0	0.247234035972	They're a scam.
0.0	0.321949614435	My background is different.
0.0	0.329360823203	If we don't stop them over there, they are coming here just as sure as I stand here in front of you.
0.0	0.278623529748	What's crony capitalism?
0.0	0.346092420532	That is beyond unspeakable.
0.0	0.371202625017	There is a radical jihadist group that is manipulating our immigration system.
0.0	0.547169690204	We raised the military spending, took from entitlements, and raised domestic spending and the deficit will explode under this.
0.0	0.261251508571	Well I want to comment on this.
0.0	0.544660526392	Our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.564501810367	But what is to prevent a future liberal president or a liberal Congress from coming back and not just raising the income tax, but also raising that VAT tax, and that vat tax is really bad for seniors.
0.0	0.480098912028	And if I misrepresented those results or those projections in any way, I was held criminally liable.
0.0	0.395375373174	Why don't we just give a chicken in every pot, while we're, you know, coming up -- coming up with these fantasy tax schemes.
0.0	0.518401280859	When millions of Americans rose up against amnesty, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.396007687591	Actually a close friend.
0.0	0.381691201267	We have the Russians and the Iranians working together, not to fight ISIS, but to prop up Assad.
0.0	0.349992807014	But they need to see leadership, support and resolve from the United States of America, and we can help them defeat ISIS.
0.0	0.288423887662	So let's start -- let's start with immigration.
0.0	0.220210664792	I've laid out...
0.0	0.423524016842	Because that person should not have gotten a gun, should not -- would not have passed a background check.
0.0	0.515177555634	I don't recall them calling for his resignation --
0.0	0.271928463428	If this country that does not keep its promise to seniors then what promise can this country hope to be trusted to keep?
0.0	0.424198220761	Marco voted on the other side.
0.0	0.334310150614	They know we will be committed to victory.
0.0	0.372926978267	I will be the Ronald Reagan if I can find a Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.328530808385	And for 30 years, the issue of immigration has been about someone who's in this country, maybe they're here illegally, but they're looking for a job.
0.0	0.366929236632	We both have a lot of small donors.
0.0	0.426984927872	Everybody said it was going to be three hours, three and a half, including them, and in about two minutes I renegotiated it so we can get the hell out of here.
0.0	0.368018277404	He's a gifted politician.
0.0	0.154596375747	So you know what needs to happen, it's a very simple equation, and it's going to happen when I'm president.
0.0	0.303072312191	I win.
0.0	0.195894960178	Just a little bit.
0.0	0.389201943394	The fact is, in order to get this economy moving again, I call for freezing regulations for a year except for the problem of public safety.
0.0	0.305487580327	So the indignation that you carry on, some of the stuff, you have to also own then.
0.0	0.37949915201	But bottom line is: The president is right.
0.0	0.348368808899	And I'll tell you what, Donald, you -- you very kindly just a moment ago offered me the V.P.
0.0	0.202506574221	And he said, oh, I'm never going to attack.
0.0	0.485512215742	I voted against it because the Southern Poverty Law Center, among other groups, said that the guest-worker programs that were embedded in this agreement were akin to slavery.
0.0	0.204201281478	Everyone up here tonight that's talking about reforms, I think and I know for myself I speak to this, we're all talking about reforms for future generations.
0.0	0.211560953804	It's what I've done or not done, or it's war.
0.0	0.342337619184	I think, actually, people are looking for that in Washington now.
0.0	0.290304394522	You know, of the few questions I've got, the last one I need is to give him some more time.
0.0	0.1982167582	We're laughed at all over the world.
0.0	0.567540158172	...One more time, in Ohio, our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.185919986554	... he's really doing some bad...
0.0	0.316081598684	Well, it ain't Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.430203473177	It continues with regulatory reform.
0.0	0.27123690682	I saw them come down.
0.0	0.328781989835	There are politics in the boardroom as well.
0.0	0.413987595441	We sent our Texas ranger recon teams.
0.0	0.309819704021	And you better get rid of them because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.

0.0	0.315379882231	It is an agenda, in my view, that would do great harm to our country.
0.0	0.448564551087	In the same light, as the foreign leader, Winston Churchill's politics were not my politics.
0.0	0.322334305308	We can take many of those same procedures, we can apply it to Medicare.

0.0	0.412821045462	With Saudi Arabia and oil production, first of all, it's so critical for us to be energy independent, and we're getting there because of fracking and we ought to explore because, see, energy independence gives us leverage and flexibility, and secondly, if you want to bring jobs back to the United States of America in industry, low prices make the difference.
0.0	0.26913662187	The point I'm making is this, the Federal Government should not be in a lot of things.

0.0	0.31375850576	Well, I'm just not sure I agree completely with that assessment.
0.0	0.519959467662	And we have to cut off the flow of foreign funding and foreign fighters.
0.0	0.371384426465	What we ought to do is tighten up our efforts to deal with the entry visa program so that a citizen from Europe, it's harder if they've been traveling to Syria or traveling to these other places where there is Islamic terrorism, make it harder -- make the screening take place.
0.0	0.420131686528	We are looking at an economy in which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.

0.0	0.238120578379	Let's listen to them and let's not listen to our politicians.
0.0	0.388411017762	These are drags on the economy, it's a deliberate drag.
0.0	0.44065276078	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the free enterprise system.

0.0	0.0430642640462	Thank you.

0.0	0.370644399808	China and Russia have never been on our side of the table.
0.0	0.225844987543	Somebody says "I'm a fighter."

0.0	0.377183781939	Well, first, Judy, I have spent my entire adult life working toward making sure that women are empowered to make their own choices, even if that choice is not to vote for me.
0.0	0.30351856177	No, I think the idea was that president -- then-Senator Obama was wrong for suggesting that it is a good idea to talk to your opponents.
0.0	0.388751155079	The fact is that this Justice Department under this president has been a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.438705549204	When people go to vote in primaries or caucuses, they are voting not only for the president, they are voting for the commander-in- chief.
0.0	0.423599651577	I will tell you, you could win a bet at a bar tonight, since we're talking about fantasy football, if you ask who the top three states in America are that produce solar energy: California and Arizona are easy, but number three is New Jersey.

0.0	0.33803348477	I'll tell you, in my family there are a lot of single moms in my family.
0.0	0.463348199672	We have to get the other 10 percent of the way to 100.
0.0	0.255769670989	And that's why, as president, I will look at communities that need special help and try to deliver that.
0.0	0.413960255873	When you look at raising the debt limit, it should be leverage to try to reform government.
0.0	0.247446164204	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.314925278031	And I think Ted Kennedy had a very clear idea about what needed to be done.
0.0	0.269121891498	It can not be someone that agrees with his agenda.
0.0	0.45696401859	It enables us to eliminate the death tax.

0.0	0.427519403122	On welfare.

0.0	0.415183017473	Maria, I'd like to interrupt this debate on the floor of the Senate to actually answer the question you asked, which was on entitlements.
0.0	0.238011194483	That's why I've entered this race, and I think I have the experience to do it.
0.0	0.168867339933	And, thank you everybody.
0.0	0.194820422431	And that's why I think these ideas up here are great, and that's what we should have is have more discussions like this and less gotcha.
0.0	0.168139746991	So we need to get on a different mindset.
0.0	0.280690822328	CRUZL But I will say --
0.0	0.281632105737	We need to make sure that we keep the country safe.
0.0	0.368705837632	They want a political revolution in which millions of Americans stand up, come together, not let the Trumps of the world divide us, and say, you know what, in this great country, we need a government that represents all of us, not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.
0.0	0.455673727475	... you had two 110-story buildings come crashing down.
0.0	0.256268208679	I'm going to go to the commanders and say give me a plan to win.
0.0	0.434991212721	I -- I've been for pausing on admitting the Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.320991165536	That's the difference.
0.0	0.601852657569	We do not have to have massive levels of income and wealth inequality.
0.0	0.459648765143	Are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the Assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire?
0.0	0.444894603836	I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years, and by the way, one of the members of that committee was Senator Strom Thurmond from South Carolina.
0.0	0.485361937692	We are in a war against ISIS.
0.0	0.316051649298	And that is that one of the things you're watching tonight are 11 quality candidates debating an important issue.
0.0	0.164896598761	I agree with them.
0.0	0.504835018125	We're going to cut Medicare and Medicaid, federal aid to education to help you, because the government is so terrible.
0.0	0.402623717885	So, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities.
0.0	0.167948532751	And I'm glad I did it.
0.0	0.373959333921	And they will work with me to get comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.388730454058	They don't care about American workers, they just care about bringing as many people in so they can get as many votes as they can.
0.0	0.481195923239	Are you coming onboard a proposal?
0.0	0.692291252359	...10% flat rate...
0.0	0.405148951996	This was a question on entitlements.
0.0	0.320441776647	But it is absolutely fair and necessary for Americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average American family?
0.0	0.195087331069	So yes, you're going to hear a lot of talk about tax reform --
0.0	0.100362479424	No, no.
0.0	0.410881064155	I want to go back to what we were talking about earlier, this budget deal in Washington.
0.0	0.245417711194	But, here is the truth.
0.0	0.176542936046	I'm prepared.
0.0	0.465033605171	We now have some good models about how better to provide employment, housing and education.
0.0	0.334171415843	John, I'd like to address this?
0.0	0.318750201184	It always seems to be the private marketplace does a better job.
0.0	0.413658373292	Yes, I believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on Wall Street, that they are a Wall Street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession -- Great Depression.
0.0	0.327729201623	It's not constitutional.
0.0	0.264104952481	They lost a lot of money, everybody said it couldn't be done.
0.0	0.285460143817	I think that sets us apart from a lot of what's happening right now on the Republican side.
0.0	0.425142642728	The big corporations have the scale to deal with all of this.
0.0	0.293530179715	And when it comes to the issues that are really on the front lines as to whether we're going to have equal pay, paid family leave, some opportunity for, you know, women to go as far as their hard work and talent take them, I think that we still have some barriers to knock down, which is why that's at the core of my campaign.
0.0	0.344915712423	What we have to do right now is bring our people together and understand that we must provide a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people.
0.0	0.290976165935	I will not take advice from Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.43009928969	And this is one of the myths that the left perpetrates on our society, and this is how they frighten people and get people to shut up.
0.0	0.504549696211	I saw you on the Senate floor flip your vote on crop insurance because they told you it would help you in Iowa, and last week, we all saw you flip your vote on ethanol in Iowa for the same reason.
0.0	0.0430642640462	...Thank you.
0.0	0.470360625017	I did it as the chairman of the Budget Committee, working with Senator Domenici.
0.0	0.494558511805	You know, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took the oath of office in 1933 at a time when 25 percent of the American people were unemployed, country was in incredible despair.
0.0	0.219151728138	...I'm going to go to Washington to stop it...
0.0	0.162820366094	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.327565892404	We elected someone as president who wants to change America, who wants to make it more like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.0430642640462	Thank you.
0.0	0.429737520102	Under -- under Barack Obama and the proposals of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and others, they've tried it their way, and it has failed miserably.
0.0	0.394235696714	What we need now is a proven leader who has produced results.
0.0	0.100362479424	And here's why.
0.0	0.270449725549	Let's talk about something that happened this week in the news.
0.0	0.343119697517	It'll be a pretty busy day, but that Iran negotiation is going to be torn up on day one.
0.0	0.386169900984	I have Ivanka, and Eric and Don sitting there.
0.0	0.2605303179	I've been passionate my whole life about the Constitution.
0.0	0.599552725231	So yes, I will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year pay zero, zero in federal income tax.
0.0	0.387177218117	Look, in addition to what Donald was saying is we also need to talk about the legal immigration system for permanent residents.
0.0	0.206436303074	No, not at all, absolutely not.
0.0	0.560630950994	This election has to be about reversing all of that damage.
0.0	0.380371250448	So, I think gun-free zones are a catastrophe.
1.0	0.614705509183	And on Common Core, Common Core has been eliminated in New Jersey.
0.0	0.286550866648	Finally, we'll take off the political handcuffs.
0.0	0.343074606079	So if you're having Medicare for all, single-payer, you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing.
0.0	0.457165872433	This isn't just the country I was born in, this is the nation that literally changed the history of my family.
0.0	0.18390533489	There'll be people here that will talk about what they're going to do.
0.0	0.195363128293	And, we said no.
0.0	0.456972330784	We came back from the dead.
0.0	0.429877623094	He was overthrown by British and American interests because he threatened oil interests of the British.
0.0	0.420141621854	So this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement.
0.0	0.42922385083	We don't have to have refugees come to our country, but all Muslims, seriously?
0.0	0.41384013364	What I did in New York was bring people together, an overwhelmingly Democratic state.

0.0	0.290070812006	I would just say that...
0.0	0.412678893372	That was before he was running against me.
0.0	0.355475705887	Of course you are right.
0.0	0.217738164305	I'd like to jump in.

0.0	0.435053527521	First, we should pass the Expatriate Terrorist Act, legislation I've introduced that says if an American goes and joins ISIS and wages jihad against America, that you forfeit your citizenship and you can not come in on a passport.
0.0	0.236778153638	We feel like we're being left behind and left out.
0.0	0.38901033318	Everybody's record's going to be scrutinized, and at the end of the day we need to unite behind the winner so we can defeat Hillary Clinton, because she is a disaster.
0.0	0.423350514648	You have to reform Social Security, and the simple way to do it is to make sure that the wealthiest don't receive the same benefits as people that are lower-income.
0.0	0.368483731355	When you became president, you had a Democratic Congress and a filibuster-proof Democratic Senate.
0.0	0.439575630178	I don't think the founders put the Second Amendment as number two by accident.
0.0	0.320982490722	You know, in our country, there are a lot of people who feel as though they just don't have the power.
0.0	0.3946256005	Can you have Medicare or Social Security?
0.0	0.331349107989	We need a fighter for this country again.
0.0	0.320195244957	That is not what America is supposed to be about.
0.0	0.265210862678	And you talk so much that nobody can ever keep up with what you're saying is accurate or not.
0.0	0.392638539852	The reason all of us are here is we believe we should be fighting for the working men and women of this country, and not Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.37125947127	It is disgraceful, and in a Christie administration, they would know much, much better than to do that.
0.0	0.3926354982	They have a sophisticated understanding of our legal immigration system and we now have an obligation to ensure that they are not able to use that system against us.

0.0	0.0958374281122	OK?
1.0	0.564280044068	This president is undermining our military.
0.0	0.355894890762	But the leaders have come forward to realize that protest is fine, but violence is wrong.
0.0	0.416239798407	It was some of the most progressive members of the United States Congress who opposed it for that reason.
0.0	0.462255051068	Yesterday, the president stunningly admitted this.
0.0	0.478238566277	And when I left, we were stronger, we were safer, and we were more united than at any time in my lifetime.
0.0	0.238650928258	All of those things are important, and all those things would happen in a Christie administration.
0.0	0.284104219852	And that's what I hear from some people, "we'll do nothing and it will just be fixed."
0.0	0.408624575477	This is the same old stuff since I left.
0.0	0.364123411337	John, could I follow up on this?
0.0	0.17078389903	I want to talk to the folks at home.
0.0	0.436939215964	Watching this broadcast tonight are millions of people that are living paycheck to paycheck.

0.0	0.311080515477	The Syrians should stay in Syria.
0.0	0.482453678285	Half of American seniors would be in poverty without a Social Security check.

0.0	0.132021685849	Right.
1.0	0.922906112426	We pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.
0.0	0.311809401622	Take it from your professors...

0.0	0.284938499944	I'm tired of seeing what's going on, between the border where the people flow over; people come in; they live; they shoot.
0.0	0.402714640993	The terrible, authoritarian, Communist dictatorship he warned us about, now he's urging companies to shut down and move to China.
0.0	0.363681002697	And yes, it was a very difficult time.
0.0	0.386128119573	He is a good man.
0.0	0.46956735809	Are you serious about this election?
0.0	0.455049046877	I am the only person in either campaign that's self-funding.
0.0	0.342901911346	And the fact is those jobs are critical, they're hard working members of the middle class and they need to be paid attention to because they're Americans and they carry the load.
0.0	0.0430642640462	Thank you.
0.0	0.410905732746	I have no clue whether the federal government is the proper place, my instinct is to say, hell no, just about everything about the federal government.
0.0	0.473142904209	Well Maria, thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the New York Times.
0.0	0.216042158191	I know the Democrats have the ultimate SuperPac.
0.0	0.290215442673	...The only way we're going to be morale, the only way we're going to keep our promise to seniors is start by following the first rule we should all follow, which is to look at them, treat them like adults, and tell them the truth.
0.0	0.206436303074	Absolutely.
0.0	0.186207394685	There's something going on and it's bad.
0.0	0.416152161631	But yes, there is more collaboration required between private sector companies and the public sector.
1.0	0.487190265513	Think about it: six and a half million people working part-time.
0.0	0.379912861098	And that's the reason that I've said under my presidency, we'll create jobs and make American the number one manufacturing country in the world.
0.0	0.195149856287	And they wonder whether somebody is getting something to -- keeping them from getting it.
0.0	0.347860918463	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.530239894454	You once had a pension.
0.0	0.521300849528	He's an S corporation.
0.0	0.242690180711	We're running.
0.0	0.249939440826	You've got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.418660778078	And I agree about the role that he played both in war and in peace on the economy and defeating fascism around the world.
0.0	0.471863550493	We have to shut down their internet capability.
0.0	0.335058634624	I recommended that the president go forward.
0.0	0.295243985342	It's the same thing that I did in Ohio.
0.0	0.371210878356	Governor Huckabee's exactly right, we need to honor the promises made to our seniors, but for younger workers -- look.
0.0	0.43391238561	Well, I would begin by reminding people that at this point in previous presidential elections, Jimmy Carter couldn't win, Ronald Reagan couldn't win, Bill Clinton couldn't win, and neither could've Barack Obama.
0.0	0.573798996847	It's tax-free -- a huge advantage for our farmers and ranchers and manufacturers -- and every import pays the 16 percent business flat tax.
0.0	0.369582710785	Well, I believe that there are abuses, those companies should be permanently barred from ever using the program again and we should put strict standards in place to ensure that they're not being abused, like the prevailing wage requirement and like the advertising requirement.
0.0	0.414958914448	We saw it in the blimp.
0.0	0.288589277571	No, they don't like he beats the rest of the field, because they want me.
0.0	0.409343355127	One, with respect to the Central American children, I made it very clear that those children needed to be processed appropriately, but we also had to send a message to families and communities in Central America not to send their children on this dangerous journey in the hands of smugglers.
0.0	0.183756806943	But here's the point I want to make tonight.
0.0	0.297766239498	So here's this -- the situation, I think, Maria.
0.0	0.192386298291	We're going to let people in, but they're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.302921390067	I'm tired of the hyphenated Americans and the division.
0.0	0.403678804064	Now Maria, listen.
0.0	0.202124844987	You know, I am by my nature impatient.
0.0	0.417485378457	You get the Senate.
0.0	0.411437220602	And second, the First Amendment Defense Act, which is protecting religious liberty, if it's not passed by then, which I suspect it won't, because the president will veto it, I will institute an executive order to make sure that people of faith are not being -- not being harassed and persecuted by the federal government for standing up for the religious beliefs.
0.0	0.412519807363	We can put America back on track on a growth level and a growth rate that we've never seen in the history of this country.
0.0	0.371928460253	We'd rebuild infrastructure that would also create jobs in this country, and we'd work with the states to do it the right way, to do it more efficiently and more effectively.
0.0	0.363777900989	I'm very angry because our country is being run horribly and I will gladly accept the mantle of anger.
0.0	0.392325690109	What would motivate me and what would be the guiding light for me in terms of immigration reform, Judy, is to bring families together, not divide them up.
0.0	0.508168048011	It's poor people and middle class.
0.0	0.431083652739	And I'll note that California senator -- Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said, if she could say to Mr. America and Mrs. America, "give me your guns, I'm rounding them up," she would.
0.0	0.38735625637	He is the party's frontrunner right now, and good for him.
0.0	0.404842314516	But as Bill said earlier, Roe v. Wade, it's has been the law for 42 years, and I don't think we should continue to try to change it.
0.0	0.393970281866	We need to break the Washington cartel, and the only way to do it is to end all the subsidies and all...
0.0	0.476198741943	This has gone on 50 or 60 years where the United States has been involved in overthrowing governments.
0.0	0.34325503216	They're concerned that Washington is so dysfunctional it is holding them back.
0.0	0.365638691813	At the end of the day, ladies and gentlemen, our best days are ahead of us only if we work together, and I intend to put this country on a path of success by working together and doing the hard things that should have been done a very long time ago.
0.0	0.410410650407	And I also want to recognize the people in that church that showed the grace of God and the grace of forgiveness and the mercy that they showed.
0.0	0.253156848175	I believe we are on the path to doing that.
0.0	0.355316710788	Maria, I assume that I can respond to that.
0.0	0.278245235175	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.571180399678	That's 13,000 miles.
0.0	0.477595253479	But all of my career, you know, having been raised in -- by a mailman father whose father was a coal miner, who died of black lung and was losing his eyesight; or a mother whose mother could barely speak English.
0.0	0.463300305016	Give Bernie Sanders credit.
0.0	0.225536046392	But if you want someone to drive you home, I will get the job done and I will get you home.
0.0	0.250709711996	And wherever you are sitting Nikki, I'm a friend.
0.0	0.441005615496	But I promise you, in the state of South Carolina, they do.
0.0	0.320040828164	And as president, I will rebuild the military and keep this country safe.
0.0	0.310739664578	But now as I travel the country, people say what I feel.
0.0	0.52108315497	Mine actually cuts the payroll tax, and I think it would spread the tax cut across all socioeconomic levels, and would allow then it to be something that would be broadly supported by the public in an election.
0.0	0.215625359842	And -- and -- you know, it goes back to the whole concept of regulations, which are in everything.
0.0	0.375627402964	It's you see the health insurance companies getting together.
0.0	0.473679485047	For 30 years this country has been baited with that.
0.0	0.452528672694	Because only if it's about three pages are you leveling the playing field between the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected who can hire the armies of lawyers and accountants and, yes, lobbyists to help them navigate their way through 73,000 pages.
0.0	0.362896426056	The natural next question is who actually has done so.
0.0	0.194131347683	Yeah, they are unhinged.
0.0	0.421785731025	And meanwhile, small businesses are getting crushed.
0.0	0.25364222281	I'll tell you how optimistic I am about America.
0.0	0.410094455805	But Iran is at the heart of most of the evil that is going on in the Middle East through their proxies.
0.0	0.273687466518	I've been there 35 times.
0.0	0.480050279483	Mine is unique in the sense that my tax plan actually gets rid of the payroll tax as well.
0.0	0.246942185751	I'm going to be introducing a plan which I call the 2020 Perfect Vision for America.
0.0	0.204940013784	You know, every election we hear a lot of talk.
0.0	0.100362479424	...
0.0	0.460254287539	The Kurds are our strongest allies.
0.0	0.375051371253	... believe me the world is peanuts by comparison.
0.0	0.293921787648	...John...
0.0	0.388665492361	We have to be prepared to defend the American people, prepare them for a long war, stand up for the defense of this country, and stand up for the values of this country...
0.0	0.305163752688	That will never happen when I am president of the United States.
0.0	0.405351018615	We were behind where we were today.
0.0	0.416930971391	So as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and the like.
0.0	0.407438069042	I want to speak to all of those maddened by political correctness, where Hillary Clinton apologizes for saying all lives matter.
0.0	0.536563943971	So they soybean sales from Iowa, entire soybean production goes -- the equivalent of it goes to China.
0.0	0.496456133263	Just for the record.
0.0	0.266157203601	We're going to get more revenue.
0.0	0.418768808016	The government is not supposed to be in every part of our lives, and that is what is causing the problem.
0.0	0.311225210288	I can tell you, there wouldn't have been much damage.
0.0	0.434355097141	Yes, I do believe that now after the American people bailed Wall Street out, yes, they should pay a Wall Street speculation tax so that we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.396742836514	I would put it in a blind trust.
0.0	0.38893716744	And I would note the other individuals on this stage were nowhere to be found in that fight.
0.0	0.388492228316	Unless you are clinically insane...
0.0	0.319447867828	Well, Maria, I'm glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what's going on in the world.
0.0	0.436514460601	I think it was a mistake to expand Medicaid everywhere in Ohio and across the country.
0.0	0.391109145545	The guns don't pull the trigger.
0.0	0.471026306852	And so he undermines the Constitution, and he undermines free enterprise by expanding government, and he betrays our allies and cuts deals with our enemies and guts our military.
0.0	0.418866503651	Suicide, alcoholism, drugs, that's why we need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country, and not just a handful of billionaires who have enormous economic and political power.
0.0	0.294211730002	Or, are you going to deal with the problem by saying, I'm going to give people who've done well in this country less benefit on the backend.
0.0	0.0430642640462	Thank you.
0.0	0.400277369121	The rest of the world is moving away from us towards other alliances because we are weak.
0.0	0.132021685849	Right.
0.0	0.428851737648	But mostly, the highest calling of leadership is to challenge the status-quo and unlock the potential of others.
0.0	0.199463266924	And I'll tell you, it was heartbreaking.
1.0	0.548205086551	If you look at a single mom buying groceries, she sees hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent.
0.0	0.405275036724	We have been talking about it for decades.
0.0	0.394786880779	But I'm not worried about my finances, I'm worried about the finances of everyday Americans who today are struggling in an economy that is not producing good paying jobs while everything else costs more.
0.0	0.468643331641	He is -- this president is undermining the constitutional basis of this government.
0.0	0.390882298431	That has to be enforced absolutely with consequences for Iran at the slightest deviation from their requirements under the agreement.
0.0	0.364628605453	Well, gee, after the last debate, I was told that I didn't smile enough.
0.0	0.227831899543	We're going to create a border.
0.0	0.458759258786	I do believe that in the year 2016 we have to look in terms of public education as colleges as part of public education making public colleges and universities tuition free.
0.0	0.297457099868	Well, the deal was done.
0.0	0.351439365443	It will be a long day.
0.0	0.305996923713	You gotta be patient.
0.0	0.346707123216	You get, like, three days where you have to show up?
0.0	0.430786790832	That is the way we deal with global warming, climate change, or any of those problems, not through government intervention, not through government taxes, and for God's sake, don't send Washington another dime until they stop wasting the money they're already sending there.
0.0	0.497230150783	We have to end crony capitalism in Washington, where the lobbyists and the powerful can get tax breaks and tax credits, and the American people don't get laws in their interest.
0.0	0.461792998089	It shifts it to the business, and it would allow middle class people to get a tax cut.
0.0	0.187256542704	You know, we -- we agree that we've got to get unaccountable money out of politics.
0.0	0.217855389209	I'm against anything that's bad for my mother.
0.0	0.416000690356	Kamatsu (ph) is a tractor company in Japan.
0.0	0.6098409349	No, it's your record.
0.0	0.270047916833	So you should go out, get a declaratory judgment, let the courts decide.
0.0	0.279659310347	(LAUGHTER) And he got nasty.
0.0	0.43195497289	We ought to give them a little bit of a liability release so that they share data amongst themselves and share data with the federal government, they're not fearful of a lawsuit.
0.0	0.322043368381	This is why, fundamentally, we have to take our government back.
0.0	0.443909421209	I never said that.
0.0	0.317393237069	And I believe that the best way to do that is to be aggressive, to be principled, but to have the goal of trying to improve relations.
0.0	0.261739890418	We need to control the border, we need to do all of this in a comprehensive way, not just going back and forth and talking about stuff --
0.0	0.295615844105	So I believe that working with Europe -- and, by the way, you know, we've got some very wealthy countries there in that part of the world.
0.0	0.29746349212	I didn't say permanently.

0.0	0.31578148649	Well, there is no evidence that they can fix anything in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.344312457348	But the president leads in this regard.

1.0	0.798204262858	I have long supported the proposition that we should lift the cap on taxable income coming into the Social Security Trust Fund, starting at $250,000.
0.0	0.0901229354617	But you know what?
0.0	0.365809353679	You know, the Security Council finally got around to adopting a resolution.

0.0	0.367997354684	I do, however, believe in Reagan's 11th commandment, and will not be engaging in awful things about my compatriots here.
0.0	0.236897642902	Let me translate that for you.
0.0	0.34007816979	And -- and -- and I -- you know, Ben is absolutely right in saying that what we don't need to do is to send more money to Washington, D.C. to fix this problem.
0.0	0.376475088476	And I put forth an immigration policy that is as strong in favor of the folks who are struggling in America the most than anybody else.
0.0	0.548115541886	Maybe it's because I hadn't given money to the foundation or donated to his wife's Senate campaign.
0.0	0.370289557103	The other Arab countries have a role to play in this.
0.0	0.435651208255	But Jeb is also right that, if we just impose a tariff, they'll put reciprocal tariffs, which will hurt Iowa farmers and South Carolina producers and 20 percent of the American jobs that depend on exports.
0.0	0.396093589571	Middle class may notice it when they get to the cash register.
0.0	0.380493777636	And not just green cards.

0.0	0.31176449479	If I could just respond.
0.0	0.438545380196	They shouldn't automatically assume that because you believe that marriage is between one man and one woman that you are a homophobe.
0.0	0.371384469604	If I could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited.
0.0	0.395736718984	A politician other than the people in the states -- I don't want to -- a politician cannot get them to pay.

0.0	0.0901229354617	You know that.

0.0	0.413475915057	That's fine.
0.0	0.255724412272	And we are not England.
0.0	0.429762397608	And I recognize -- I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa.
0.0	0.402191711474	We need to begin by undoing -- I would begin by undoing a whole set of things that President Obama has done, whether it's illegal amnesty or this latest round of EPA regulations.
0.0	0.416494248981	But I will tell you this, Atlantic City, you're using that, hundreds of companies that I have opened have thrived.
0.0	0.217672560743	We're going to be tough at the border, we're going to be tough on all of the illegal immigrants that everybody else in this field -- we're going to be different.
0.0	0.250546540453	I'm not fighting that.
0.0	0.376035484829	You know, whatever your issue, your cause, the festering problem you hoped would resolved, the political class has failed you.

0.0	0.229829133348	You know, let me say something at the outset.
0.0	0.573790286844	And the only reason we got them back is because we owed them with a stupid deal, $150 billion.
0.0	0.444721511329	That is principally an American-led air campaign that we are now engaged in.
0.0	0.212664727605	No vision at all.

0.0	0.391477753557	MACCALLUM: Thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.372223008809	I don't think it's so much about when the government orders a corporation to do something.
0.0	0.291590550694	But the key thing that we're seeing now is serious challenges to this country that must change, the direction of this nation must change.
1.0	0.355536985218	I didn't have an involvement with them.
0.0	0.240383553372	Yes.

0.0	0.295751518957	I'm very proud that NARAL endorsed me because when it comes to it we need a leader on women's issues.
0.0	0.353707903219	So I don't know if you would call that a weakness, but my wife said "let up."
0.0	0.419264100709	And frankly, it just came out, and in Iowa now, as you know, Ted, in the last three polls, I'm beating you.
0.0	0.501628968171	And the entire New York times attack -- is that I disclosed that loan on one filing with the United States Senate, that was a public filing.
0.0	0.161669161549	I like it.
0.0	0.277193779394	It ain't going to happen.

1.0	0.497039350821	He has called him a disappointment.
0.0	0.0958374281122	OK.
0.0	0.403231936381	So what we do, though, is, if there is somebody who is price- gouging, we have laws for prosecutors to take that on.
0.0	0.228858752877	And I'll tell you one thing that we never talk about -- we haven't talked about it tonight.
0.0	0.420074180675	Thank you, senator.
0.0	0.296199033347	Divide that out.
0.0	0.419002323984	I was on morning Joe at a town hall and a young student stood up and said, "Can I still be idealistic?"
0.0	0.372496672482	And by the way, it's not just on immigration, you used to support TPA, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.301995185086	We need to rebuild our families.
0.0	0.422878401943	And that's why they have it in Europe, because it is a way to blindfolded the people, that's what Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.378821963819	You got Kuwait and you got Qatar and you got Saudi Arabia.
0.0	0.169389499866	I was down there, and I've never seen anything like it.
0.0	0.515409294124	I have fully endorsed those.
0.0	0.377844390313	But our goal is, in fact, to try over a period of time to, in fact, deal with our enemies, not just ignore that reality.
0.0	0.477865892897	Twenty-four months ago, 36 months ago, you did not have a group of radical crazies named ISIS who were burning people in cages and recruiting people to enter our country legally.
0.0	0.404271724426	And it's especially significant that they are working with both Turkey and Greece in order to do this.
0.0	0.355318262348	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.345006107173	As we speak, there are new problems on the horizon.
0.0	0.453177894936	Here's why, the president of the United States and both his attorney's general, they give the benefit of the doubt to the criminal, not to the police officers.
0.0	0.412885755098	We elected a president that is weakening America on the global stage.
0.0	0.211004410681	We need to stop that.
0.0	0.364565032733	That's real moral authority that we need in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.412595606294	So we have no disagreement about the need to buttress Social Security, get more revenue into the program.
0.0	0.390719367271	You know, I sat down with the senior leadership of John Deere.
0.0	0.38670281728	These attack ads are going to be part of life.
0.0	0.61689625513	And every single income decile sees a double-digit increase in after-tax income.
0.0	0.326471874816	I love Donald Trump.
0.0	0.405351157309	And what I have concluded is that the best policy is to get rid of all government subsidies, and get the government out of our lives, and let people rise and fall based on how good they are.
0.0	0.375427222988	Senator Cruz is precisely right.
0.0	0.303131797511	No, he doesn't.
0.0	0.386585713517	People are being released from jail without the education, without the job training, without the resources that they need to get their lives together, then they end up -- we're shocked that they end up back in jail again.
0.0	0.320191784476	Number -- and that is important for you to know.
0.0	0.336763748556	You know, you had Herbert Hoover before that saying, no, we got to only worry about the deficit.
0.0	0.437720010206	I was the chairman of the National Commission on Homeland Security and Terrorism for the United States for five years.
0.0	0.261059987884	Let me just say this.
0.0	0.304181073805	So what if children are going hungry?
0.0	0.437494829892	She is still defending Planned Parenthood, and she is still her party's frontrunner.
0.0	0.485120735743	I was a governor during the 9/11 attack.
0.0	0.376980041075	I actually have a plan.
0.0	0.399946983439	I will stand firm.

0.0	0.389664299901	I would say that I would and I have a permit, which is very unusual in New York -- a permit to carry.
0.0	0.253495596679	What we need to do is destroy their ability to attack us here over there, and then get out.
0.0	0.452048684346	Heck, find me a Republican in Congress that would cut spending ten dollars.
0.0	0.400602213902	If elected president, I will do everything I can to expand Social Security benefits, not just for seniors, but for disabled veterans, as well.
0.0	0.396583562451	We need to get back in the game as it relates to our Arab nations.
0.0	0.21076887576	You know, I find it really quite fascinating some of the president's proclamations.
0.0	0.354713324743	So this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle.
0.0	0.564386468531	But the poll numbers have.
0.0	0.222979253225	The only way we're going to solve this problem is with we, the people.
0.0	0.165916724718	I know this, I certainly am.
0.0	0.341077444991	I am a little skeptical about your governor actually caring enough about higher education to make any kind of commitment like that.
0.0	0.270106447849	You gotta be -- stick with it, and all that.
0.0	0.32067922739	I think there's a sense in this country today that somehow our best days are behind us.
0.0	0.406047928691	And, the fact is, none of them.
0.0	0.335336737043	We're up 347,000 jobs.
0.0	0.430765830973	What I said was I don't believe that I would be president of the United States and have the same dysfunction that exists in Washington, D.C. now.
0.0	0.406340663436	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.35893119372	I think Americans want someone to have a track record of showing them how to get this country back on record, someone who will stand up and every day project that best days of America are in front of us.
0.0	0.497554170087	I stood yesterday with 75 construction workers.
0.0	0.390663438738	So I not only had the opportunity to go through the Cold War struggles in Central America, and even after 9/11 to be involved.
0.0	0.455389997638	And the same goes for overseas, where we have to put together a coalition of Muslim nations.
0.0	0.330472685199	Make our streets safe again.
0.0	0.425209450259	There is one major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people.
1.0	0.844431904302	We do what the American people want, to expand Social Security by $1,300 a year for people under $16,000, and we extend the life of Social Security for 58 years.
0.0	0.162634361818	Yeah, he said everybody.
0.0	0.314398123015	The answer is yes.
0.0	0.418187022837	America is back in the leadership business.
0.0	0.413430213644	Last I heard, a United States senator had the right to disagree with the president, including a president who has done such an extraordinary job.
0.0	0.38229138676	Now, the challenge we're seeing today is that the Supreme Court is being converted into some type of political body.
0.0	0.523930516746	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.403892225894	It's like a tariff, but here's the difference: if we impose a tariff, China responds.
0.0	0.416336055273	In this particular moment of serious crises, saying to the American people don't give up on the political process.
0.0	0.368957403955	I think he means somebody who hasn't been a career politician, and who's been out of office for awhile.
0.0	0.0696415128846	But look...
0.0	0.166026191275	But, you know what we're not telling them?
0.0	0.44855573067	What we need to do is take the rest of the federal entitlements, not just welfare, but food stamps and Medicaid and housing programs and do the same thing we did with welfare.
0.0	0.385842228691	The question was, would you meet with an adversary without conditions?
0.0	0.341813738527	And then what he did is redefine the role of government.
0.0	0.456122483626	But I'd sign a second one, as I did in New York, as well, having a hard hiring freeze on adding new employees except for the military or defense-related positions.
0.0	0.326924213715	We need to have stronger families.
0.0	0.43667638292	Imagine a country where the middle class can get rising income again.
0.0	0.28650283329	And just so -- if I could, because he insulted a lot of people.
0.0	0.201976410469	One thing I want to be clear about tonight.
0.0	0.370451268757	Secondly, a policy on recruiting and hiring, and then more resources for -- for training.
0.0	0.453546665161	If an American missionary has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.362195113074	And, it was made for we the people, we are the ones who decide who we are, and we should never give away the values and principles that made America into a great nation for the sake of political correctness.
0.0	0.362611566685	You know, Hillary Clinton's always saying how Republicans don't follow science?
0.0	0.359939958142	Now, Bill, he loves to criticize America, apologize for us, criticize medieval Christians.
0.0	0.321050659755	But the facts and the law here are really quite clear.
0.0	0.414085643815	(APPLAUSE) This is not a cage match.
0.0	0.414630246164	I think what our campaign is indicating is that the American people are tired of establishment politics, tired of establishment economics.
0.0	0.362541251735	They're devaluing their currency and they're killing our companies.
0.0	0.288261567627	Well, let me just -- let me just say, once again...
0.0	0.380025219493	And clearly, what we need to do is get a group of experts together, including people from other countries, some of our friends from Israel, who have had experience screening these people and come up with new guidelines for immigration, and for visas, for people who are coming into this country.
0.0	0.373539649819	...incentives for people to keep people healthy, rather than giving the incentives to treat them when they're sick?
0.0	0.370384941425	The FCC jumping in now and saying, "we're going to put 400 pages of regulation over the Internet," is going to create massive problems.
1.0	0.675920865349	Ronald Regan opposed the value tax because he said it was a way to blindfold the people, so the true cost of government was not there there for them.
0.0	0.378079469569	They know that this country is pushing the middle class, the hardworking taxpayers, backwards, and they saw a president who doesn't understand their pain, and doesn't have any plan for getting away from it.
0.0	0.438906228797	A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to go on a congressional delegation.
0.0	0.403666676226	You will also have to means-test the benefits and declare there's not enough money.
0.0	0.358443136929	I went out and said, it's ridiculous.
0.0	0.376131421915	Every time we send signals like this, we send a signal of weakness, not strength.
0.0	0.47263777421	Why should we let their people be sitting there smoking their cigars, sitting in their comfortable chairs in Raqqa?
0.0	0.296041035039	And I believe people need a leader who is prepared to make tough calls in tough times and stand up...
0.0	0.100362479424	I was not at all.
0.0	0.321133193265	No Jeb, I don't remember -- well, let me tell you.
0.0	0.273451682769	Look, we have to stop with political correctness.
0.0	0.166484532744	... and I'll tell you why.
0.0	0.5109555776	...is the lowest personal rate any candidate up here has, and what it would also enable us to do is for every citizen to fill out their taxes on a postcard so we can eliminate the IRS.
0.0	0.482687049122	We went after companies that were ripping off shareholders.
0.0	0.322580176723	I will put a price tag.
0.0	0.328458208515	You know, some of these -- these engagement rules that the administration has -- "we're not going to bomb a tanker that's coming out of there because there might be a person in it" -- give me a break.
0.0	0.428544439808	I believe in the PTT because it's important those countries in Asia are interfacing against China.
0.0	0.129348903854	I think we should do both.
0.0	0.402803945515	Do senators have the right to disagree with the president?
0.0	0.0430642640462	Thank you.
0.0	0.296864657315	Why didn't they call?
0.0	0.204188416177	There have been some good recommendations about what needs to happen.
0.0	0.423449364597	Let's quit blaming the people on Social Security.
0.0	0.146767442182	It's not that hard.
0.0	0.475289666014	We have $2.5 trillion outside of the United States which we want to bring back in.
0.0	0.328299137026	We need leadership, someone who has a backbone and sticks with things, rather than just talks about them as though anything matters when you're talking about amendments that don't even actually are part of a bill that ever passed.
0.0	0.305447875364	I know we can do this because we're still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
1.0	0.613701758509	In the past he has called him weak.
0.0	0.402085049439	People are upset about it.
0.0	0.264056932758	Japan, the same thing.
0.0	0.470903920051	We're nowhere close to a balanced budget or fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.543684769118	My tax plan enables you to fill out your taxes on a postcard so we can abolish the IRS.
0.0	0.442533882148	I want to speak to all the moms and dads whose sons and daughters are fighting for this country, and the incredible sense of betrayal when you have a commander-in-chief who will not even speak the name of our enemy, radical Islamic terrorism, when you have a commander-in- chief who sends $150 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, who's responsible for murdering hundreds of our servicemen and women.
0.0	0.45722583927	In that State of the Union, President Obama didn't so much as mention the 10 sailors that had been captured by Iran.
0.0	0.24976335742	But we stuck to our message.
0.0	0.361150366676	Neil...
0.0	0.347800309497	And when you have insider information, which apparently has been the case, where people use that information and use big data to try to take advantage of it, there has to be some regulation.
0.0	0.44887192881	Well, it's not a matter of what the first executive order would be, Bill.
0.0	0.408368592817	We have to protect our 2nd amendment and you cannot do this and certainly what Barack Obama was doing with the executive order.
0.0	0.396278341133	My sister was a single mom, both of my aunts who were a single moms.
0.0	0.154613514567	Everybody knows that.
0.0	0.132021685849	That's not right.
0.0	0.14704773332	How are we going to do this?
0.0	0.386258585027	-- work better to lift everyone up, men and women.
0.0	0.281409475835	Because it wouldn't work.
0.0	0.471375756868	It's peanuts.
0.0	0.228650630626	We need a president who can solve our problems, bring us together.
0.0	0.383232685535	What we have got to do is make it clear that any police officer who breaks the law will, in fact, be held accountable.
0.0	0.452185878265	And so do I.
0.0	0.254249028766	The only way we're going to defund Planned Parenthood is have a pro-life president.
0.0	0.415684813584	I would hope that we could all agree that we are sick and tired of seeing videos on television of unarmed people, often African-Americans, shot by police officers.
0.0	0.352513963024	The president wants to do things without working with his Congress, without working with the legislature, and without getting the consent of the American people.
0.0	0.362076073794	You'll see me on the floor of the Senate tomorrow filibustering this and saying enough is enough, no more debt.
0.0	0.442061550755	Does he stand up for law enforcement?
0.0	0.416030818314	I agree with President Obama who used executive orders to protect families because the Congress, the House was unable or refused to act.
0.0	0.437640447547	And the last line standing between them and our families might be us and a gun.
0.0	0.205571944121	He's wrong.
0.0	0.495634540442	And aligned with a corrupt campaign finance system is a rigged economy.
0.0	0.335270209184	And you look around, and you see what's happening, and this is not the case when he introduced the doctor -- very nice, everything perfect but that is not representative of what you have in that line of migration.
0.0	0.375618339797	When the Social Security program was started in the 1930s, not very many women worked.
0.0	0.209258537211	Yes, they've got to get out of Syria.
0.0	0.400273556658	Why not go to Congress and in a bipartisan way, begin to deal with the process of mental health issues so that people that are spiraling out of control because of mental health challenges don't have access to guns.
0.0	0.394931330931	But the good news is the next commander-in-chief is standing on this stage.
0.0	0.253525695762	Republicans and Democrats alike believe this.
0.0	0.379715883176	And secondly, we should pass the legislation that I've introduced...
0.0	0.0958374281122	OK.
0.0	0.163015270119	That's for sure.
1.0	0.880762553334	We're spending $80 billion a year locking up fellow Americans.
0.0	0.435220455445	I voted against the war in Iraq because I listened very carefully to what President Bush and Vice President Cheney had to say and I didn't believe them.
0.0	0.171574967231	So I would -- I would be willing to do that.
0.0	0.348658597667	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.448907865868	I've a bill to fix Social Security.
0.0	0.410430582344	Obamacare, we're going to repeal it and replace it.
0.0	0.294170982098	And by those standards, we're not doing particularly well.
0.0	0.401289893732	Here's the bottom line, and I'll close with this.
0.0	0.326842493846	And we finally need to tackle the basics to cut this government down to size and hold it accountable.
0.0	0.426497305972	... no, you already had your chance, Marco, and you blew it.
0.0	0.523254526701	And we fought for statewide school choice, where the dollars follow the child, instead of the child following the dollars.
0.0	0.489169073261	Marco leaves the IRS code in with all of the complexity.
0.0	0.327103228226	Since he brought me up, do I not get to respond?
0.0	0.404294489657	in particular.
0.0	0.651725486353	You can't get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year.
0.0	0.362448058068	I believe that it's most important that we unleash the full potential of women and girls in our society.
0.0	0.257335710212	I am a conservative; I can win this job, I can do this job, I need your help, I need your support.
0.0	0.475442991078	Change the Mexico City policy, not take one dime of taxpayer money to fund abortion organizations overseas, and restore the NSA that's been gutted.
0.0	0.370834761549	Now, the fact is, what this president has done is invited Russia to play an even bigger role, bring in Vladimir Putin to negotiate getting those chemical weapons back from Assad, yet what do we have today?
0.0	0.38595780884	But we need to understand that American Muslims are on the front line of our defense.
0.0	0.509333603052	Focus on the diseases that are costing us the trillions of dollars.
0.0	0.346229542811	Well, you know, I think, from a historical point of view, somebody with my background, somebody with my views, somebody who has spent his entire life taking on the big money interests, I think a Sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment, as well.
0.0	0.3691009896	The better way of dealing with this -- the better way of dealing with this is recognizing that there are people in, you know, the -- Islamic terrorists inside, embedded in refugee populations.
0.0	0.210486612435	All right, look, this has been a great debate.
0.0	0.43857129728	That makes the world less peaceful, less safe.
0.0	0.37837977386	I can see why people are angry and scared, because this president has created a condition where our national security has weakened dramatically.
0.0	0.371906329618	Your prosecute criminals.
0.0	0.345273631974	He wasn't my senator.
0.0	0.486561114193	The final observation, invoked Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.262328851794	And I'll tell you, I'm not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump.
0.0	0.319863247713	...Then I'll buy you a tequila...
0.0	0.378745557329	Yes, our allies are not perfect.
0.0	0.184785775229	You've got to give people hope.
0.0	0.270247262492	I think we should be for free trade but I think fair trade.
0.0	0.399260230044	Our job has to be to recognize the conflict between the two.
0.0	0.100362479424	And why?
0.0	0.349906977625	So I'm going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of Americans fulfilling their potential, because I don't think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single American to live up to theirs.
0.0	0.528945098404	The biggest tax increase happened under the watch of Barack Obama, and spending's gone up.
0.0	0.515299677196	Now, I for seven years was the U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.132021685849	That's right.
0.0	0.145025508302	That's what we need.
0.0	0.249387579384	We know this for a fact.
0.0	0.0845141406617	Yeah.
0.0	0.182784798716	And you know, he's right.
0.0	0.352898148061	... on Larry Tribe.
0.0	0.387493706563	is exactly the leadership we need in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.512376666778	Is there an area for a safety net?
0.0	0.278780498674	If I have a weakness, it's that I try to live by the rules.
0.0	0.226832777394	I'm going to do it for America.
0.0	0.361522581829	But if that's the best the New York Times has got, they better go back to the well.
0.0	0.418512129658	So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.286692654466	It is hard to find someone in my generation that thinks Social Security will be there for us.
0.0	0.355071627596	We lose on trade.
0.0	0.325660922463	Maria, I'd just like to say...
0.0	0.438679133755	In terms of 2007 immigration reform, yeah, I did vote against it.
0.0	0.387808434247	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.0901229354617	You know why?
0.0	0.469055979703	I will cut this government down to size and hold it accountable, simplify the tax code, roll back the regulations that have been spewing out of Washington, D.C. for 50 years.
0.0	0.353449335759	I strongly support the president's executive actions.
0.0	0.447083236926	This deal in Washington is an example of why Washington's broken.
0.0	0.205571944121	We were wrong.
0.0	0.48955618715	My point is this: I won two landslide elections, I made big changes.
1.0	0.807011486047	Let's not have the most expensive business tax rate in the world.
0.0	0.382096012476	We have to provide the NATO support to back up the mission that is going on.
0.0	0.370428244252	So we have a good group of people.
0.0	0.42061521385	And what I think all of us are saying is, our monetary policy, our tax policy, regulatory policy needs to be radically changed so we can create high sustained growth for income to rise.
0.0	0.385552047731	So, are we going to ban Muslims from India, from Indonesia, from countries that are strong allies -- that we need to build better relationships with?
0.0	0.34075947825	But I feel that the gun-free zones and, you know, when you say that, that's target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill. That's target.
0.0	0.450141031371	Did any of you get a phone call from Bill Clinton?
0.0	0.46317278801	So why are the pharmaceutical companies consolidating?
0.0	0.439843677087	I may not be your dream candidate just yet, but I can assure you I am Hillary Clinton's worst nightmare.
0.0	0.292039022389	And they must be part of our coalition to destroy ISIS and I believe we can get that done.
0.0	0.270582074791	You know, everyone here talks about the need to take on Washington.
0.0	0.476759000529	When I was in Washington, I fought to get the budget balanced.
0.0	0.436940384762	I just left Indonesia -- bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb.
0.0	0.567440237836	We pay federal taxes.
0.0	0.33425881886	In fact, he's done worse than nothing.
0.0	0.410456264115	The first one would be to my good friend, Bibi Netanyahu, to reassure him we will stand with the State of Israel.
0.0	0.380931941423	John Harwood, there's a bigger issue here.
0.0	0.344242201696	We also want to dominate this from a commercial side.
0.0	0.384589822818	That's not the role of the government.
0.0	0.245740413664	Most importantly, I think I understand leadership, which sometimes requires a tough call in a tough time.
0.0	0.227007899207	They're going to end up in the productive economy, which is where we want them.
0.0	0.401057441218	But we allowed people to keep health care.
0.0	0.304748402707	You know, I have said -- I have said many times, you know, I'm not asking people to support me because I'm a woman.
0.0	0.386282097246	The domino theory, you know, if Vietnam goes, China, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.
0.0	0.296986929904	You gotta be creative and imaginative.
0.0	0.340697717381	We need to reform Social Security.
0.0	0.317199549557	And I feel very strongly that I have an agenda, I have a record that really does respond to a lot of the specific needs that the women in our country face.
0.0	0.554997743701	Meantime, wages have stagnated for 40 years.

0.0	0.455607850363	Atlantic City has gone bad.
0.0	0.317281288574	We need a nominee who is going to throw every punch, not pull punches, and someone who cannot stumble before he even gets into the ring.
0.0	0.394973776805	My name was mentioned.
0.0	0.509680582717	Senator Sanders, from a debate in 2008, quote what I said.
0.0	0.254115829985	I believe in it but we have to be smart and we have to use smart people to negotiate.
0.0	0.448395886354	It's a simple formula: common sense regulations, which is why I think we should freeze all federal regulations for one year, except for health and safety.
0.0	0.310340351991	Now, what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next.
0.0	0.442727231505	And the people who are often the most hard-hit are widows, because when their spouse dies, they can lose up to one-half of their Social Security monthly payment.
0.0	0.489726717685	They told you that your Social Security money is in a trust fund.
0.0	0.322046809426	If you'll answer the (inaudible) core question.
0.0	0.411455810241	Well, if that's the case, we're going to win every state, if Bernie Sanders is the nominee.
0.0	0.369321816676	But let me just say that we also need down -- to tear down the cyber walls that China is erecting, that Russia is erecting.
0.0	0.405232180654	And when it began, we had no political organization, no money, and not much name recognition outside of the state of Vermont.

0.0	0.0867869497012	I think if it doesn't...
0.0	0.411520173668	Well, first let me address the tax issue because it's related to the entitlement issue and I want to thank you for holding a substantive debates where we can have debates about these key issues on taxes.
0.0	0.377571099853	I would choose Nelson Mandela for his generosity of heart, his understanding of the need for reconciliation.
0.0	0.250357303343	Look, I think we are readier than we used to be, but it's a constant effort that has to be undertaken to make sure we are as ready as we need to be.
0.0	0.100362479424	Not -- not on that, no.
0.0	0.481640325596	When extraordinarily wealthy people make very large contributions to Super PACs, and in many cases in this campaign, Super PACs have raised more money than individual candidates have, OK?
0.0	0.415542245402	Today, many of us picked up our newspapers, and we were horrified to see the sight of 10 American sailors on their knees, with their hands on their heads.
0.0	0.320785055776	Americans are tired of hearing this debate -- want to go to, what are you going to do about illegal immigration?
0.0	0.10423769314	I will do that.
0.0	0.337989012965	Because I think we have to get to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.194951679616	So I'm going to come up with the best way forward.
0.0	0.464883247764	I've spent a lifetime in politics fighting the Clinton machine.
0.0	0.357896133799	First thing I'd tell the American people, whatever it takes to defend our nation, I would do.
0.0	0.396903459576	Don't vote for me if you want to keep the gridlock in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.449068552397	So it's not just the government -- the private sector companies, it's also our own government that needs to raise the level of our game.
0.0	0.579692449885	Mine is the only plan that saves over $1 trillion and that's why I'm answering your question.
0.0	0.339847188307	In my view healthcare is a right of all people, not a privilege, and I will fight for that.
0.0	0.450472610932	We have to provide financial support to them.
0.0	0.494953963124	Yeah, again, as I said, we're raising a family in the 21st century and it's one of the reasons why my tax plan is a pro- family tax plan.
0.0	0.600829196867	Eleven points, to be exact.
0.0	0.228779841508	The truth is this, the big problem, we need a leader in Washington who understands how to get something done, not to talk about it, not to propose it, to get it done.
0.0	0.345589423416	It's the only way to level the playing field between big and powerful and small and powerless.
0.0	0.362093642358	They're a feeding frenzy for sick people.
0.0	0.579213250006	Under my plan, no business, big or small, will pay more than 25 percent flat rate on their business income.
0.0	0.556016194487	It was an investment bank, Lehman Brothers, that contributed to our collapse.
0.0	0.335293661792	Why, for the life of me, I do not understand why did we stop doing vocational education in America, people that can work with their hands; people you can train to do this work while they're still in high school so they can graduate ready to go work.
0.0	0.530192458647	And I have set forth a compact that would do just that for debt-free tuition.
0.0	0.428289640833	I have yet to see a proposal that you're describing that the -- raising the cap would apply to passive income.
0.0	0.420946029172	There are many lawyers.
0.0	0.300474089506	And some of them, I will say, not all, have called me and said, "Donald, thank you very much; you're exposing an unbelievable problem and we have to get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.414529816211	Neil, I was mentioned too.
0.0	0.345059816611	Somebody who is very fond of the president, agrees with him most of the time, I disagree with his recent deportation policies.
0.0	0.324000772817	Here's the deal, Chris is totally right.
0.0	0.292797943358	But you know, here's the real issue, is this America anymore?
0.0	0.427428269869	Not keeping the government open.
0.0	0.310960883783	We're a country of laws, not of men, not of people who do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.388191015981	Helping business make profits.
0.0	0.40847867127	And Bernie Sanders will tell them that it's because of the rich.
0.0	0.326704032444	So let's support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition.
0.0	0.36370833316	Reforms, everything from moral and cultural issues to economic issues.
0.0	0.171834045501	They do whatever what they do, OK.
0.0	0.100362479424	No.
0.0	0.173756794639	You know what he said to me?
0.0	0.303517239048	OK, just so you understand -- I know so much about trading about with China.
0.0	0.402107687832	And when we talk about Wall Street, let's talk about Wall Street.
0.0	0.362544470802	And Carl -- Carl, I'm not finished yet.
0.0	0.481974968908	I'm saying, absolutely, we don't have to continue to lose 505 billion dollars as a trade deficit for the privilege of dealing with China.
0.0	0.363438948631	The matter is what orders exist now that shouldn't exist?
0.0	0.243915347905	I try to live by the rules, no matter what they are, and I was brought up that way as a kid.
0.0	0.401574055534	The second will be to the supreme leader of Iran.
0.0	0.353366391644	And that is what they told me when I was in Jordan in November.
0.0	0.444410246833	Those are the hard numbers.
0.0	0.218315566154	And that's why we must make sure we continue to frack.
0.0	0.420187474019	But if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in Flint.
0.0	0.320705534031	It was a coalition made up of Arabs and Americans and westerners and we're going to need it again.
0.0	0.441711865997	We need to embed with -- with the Iraqi military.
0.0	0.402660732799	Let us actually go to zero- based budgeting so we know where the money is being spent.
0.0	0.21908422902	We hear actually a lot of good intentions.
0.0	0.48828527392	I voted for comprehensive immigration reform in 2007.
0.0	0.425067668013	And secondly, when you talk about me being on the board of Lehman Brothers, I wasn't on the board of Lehman Brothers.
0.0	0.686015687848	We have a budget closer to $3.5 trillion.
0.0	0.328981683925	He's been a good governor, and he's a heck of a lot better than his predecessor that would have bankrupted New Jersey.
0.0	0.53687529051	I have a proven record of success, 32 years in business, and 8 years as Governor of the state of Florida.
0.0	0.490051644494	... that he tried to take credit for four years later.
0.0	0.463954888294	I've got a proven record fighting to defend the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.233927153224	They're tough, they're strong, they're great people.
0.0	0.367454703322	And we got to fight like crazy so people can think the American dream still exists, because it does, with rising wages, with full employment and with everybody in America -- and I mean everybody in America -- having an opportunity to realize the American dream of having a better life than their mother and their father.
0.0	0.391696598491	And there's a reason why Hillary's supporters are echoing Donald's attacks on me, because Hillary...
0.0	0.311145887459	I think, though, government is too big now.
0.0	0.431559955496	I cut the bureaucracy down to size, re-introduced accountability, focused on service, on innovation, on leading in every market, in every product segment.
0.0	0.23826305816	Maybe we would've gotten a deal where we didn't give everything away.
0.0	0.303030934536	...Chris...
0.0	0.434417272573	Do you remember when he ran for president of the United States, and he was a candidate, and he went and said, "These Americans with traditional values, they are bitter people, and they cling to their guns and to their religion."
0.0	0.203657455184	I think he's tapped into an anger that people feel.
0.0	0.336335719813	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.246730569154	We need Jordan.
0.0	0.330186193306	And I'll go back to something that had been mentioned just a few minutes ago.
0.0	0.32621234873	In my world, we'll focus on energy independence and a clean environment.
0.0	0.335489413602	That's essentially what we have now, and we don't need that.
0.0	0.405742396085	This country is running out of time.
0.0	0.269180928546	I mean, let me be honest with the people who are watching at home.
1.0	0.554596032855	And by the way, when I left, there were over 1 million fewer people on welfare in New York state than when I took office...
0.0	0.267481412822	I'm going to prioritize those recipients who need the most help first.
0.0	0.611754001894	But the average person takes out about $350,000.
0.0	0.37439105677	So, I'm proud of Senator Sanders, and his supporters.
0.0	0.380851922886	When I am president, I will work consistently every single day to keep this country safe, not call Edward Snowden, as you did, a great public servant.
0.0	0.397817586336	Or would you rather take less later on?
0.0	0.370671006729	These mythical Arab armies that my friends talk about that are going to protect us don't exist.
0.0	0.356161576362	America's at a crossroads.
0.0	0.360772436551	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.359017022646	My heart has not changed, because I've always been appalled by abortion.
0.0	0.361456118064	I will show you what they do to women.
0.0	0.287049080061	Oh, well, you know, it just didn't work out for you.
0.0	0.37612890828	Iran sanctions -- the Iran sanctions that brought them to the table, those are sanctions that we put in place when I was in the United States Senate, and a whole host of other things that put me in a position of saying, I not only have a great vision, but I can govern effectively in Washington.
0.0	0.295306150004	And we can no longer continue to sweep it under the rug.
0.0	0.464235682088	And you put me on that stage against her next September, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.233283622006	We need somebody who can lead.
0.0	0.234925368198	We're going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education.
0.0	0.602096865442	This is a business flat tax.
0.0	0.411566533617	But I think a pause on Syrian refugees has been exactly right for all the governors that have called for it, and also, of course, for me as the governor of Ohio.
0.0	0.574063876402	23 million files in the hands of the Chinese?
0.0	0.46507762437	Friends of mine are ordering Kamatsu (ph) tractors now because they've de-valued the yen to such an extent that you can't buy a Caterpillar tractor.
0.0	0.458518566945	I've done it once in Washington, with great jobs and lower taxes.
0.0	0.23155867521	And I could say, oh, I'm not angry.
0.0	0.522144634163	We have talked about tax reform in every single election for decades.
0.0	0.354603231447	That's not the America that I've ever known.
0.0	0.362879079705	And I would not stand for that as president of the United States.
0.0	0.315108190651	Actually going to do something to help the American worker.
0.0	0.328075903856	I think it is fair to say, whatever the complaints that you want to make about him are, that with respect to China, one of the most challenging relationships we have, his opening up China and his ongoing relationships with the leaders of China is an incredibly useful relationship for the United States of America.
0.0	0.388336124787	Well, one of us ran against Barack Obama.
0.0	0.489334711402	So when you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration -- which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother -- clearly, we are looking at institutional racism.
1.0	0.354434449645	It got stolen from them.
0.0	0.373919580069	I would give up some Social Security to save a system that Americans are going to depend on now and in the future.
0.0	0.443583157566	Well, Secretary Clinton, you're not in the White House yet.
0.0	0.406291666528	This president and John Kerry and Hillary Clinton all have made it harder for the next president to act, but he must act to confront the ambitions of Iran.
0.0	0.449473011427	Look, I am deeply concerned about what's happening in every community in America, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths.
0.0	0.262637334276	We're going to start the process of securing that border.
0.0	0.291420310402	But they can't get along.
0.0	0.256946542982	I will tell you that.
0.0	0.258029596265	It's like them getting mugged, and then us saying, well, we're going to mug you some more.
0.0	0.246509636858	We both want to get more revenue in.
0.0	0.396027163387	Sometimes you win a war by killing murderous, evil terrorists.
0.0	0.373654333214	Let's let a Justice Department -- and I will make an attorney general who will enforce the law and make justice more than just a word.
0.0	0.326798011615	Thirdly, we need to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to send a serious signal that we're back in the game with Israel --
0.0	0.288145844078	And for good cause.
0.0	0.456223808382	A lot has happened in nine months.
0.0	0.455579670557	She was naturalized.
1.0	0.764841917215	A vat is imposed as a sales tax when you buy a good.
0.0	0.307948494157	He's penalized -- and doesn't understand.
0.0	0.323058020172	If I'm president, there won't be stupid deals anymore.
0.0	0.403313755749	So what I will tell you about our incentives -- our incentives are tight, and at the end of the day we make sure that we gain more from the creation of jobs than what we lose.
0.0	0.344558124232	Who can you count on to keep us safer, stronger and freer?
0.0	0.671386008184	Now, Secretary Clinton's Super PAC, as I understand it, received $25 million dollars last reporting period, $15 million dollars from Wall Street.
0.0	0.395085517129	With all the candidates, why me?
0.0	0.184195721463	Oh, I'll talk about that, too.
0.0	0.436580831909	And the people who are getting hammered are small businesses, it's single moms, it's Hispanics.
0.0	0.235328185194	Because, I've got to tell you the truth, even in New Jersey what you're doing is called rude.
0.0	0.552869723803	Now in terms of their really stunning hit piece, what they mentioned is when I was running for senate -- unlike Hillary Clinton, I don't have masses of money in the bank, hundreds of millions of dollars.
0.0	0.386385808884	Well, to start with, unlike President Obama, I'll actually name the enemy that we confront.
0.0	0.260407867019	I'm not blaming Chris, by the way, but he will know about that.
0.0	0.428108844468	Martha, religious liberty doesn't include encouraging a fellow American to engage in violent jihad and kill an American here.
0.0	0.327955941329	They can solve the problem of North Korea if they wanted to but they taunt us.
0.0	0.455767903504	The big Internet companies.
0.0	0.32783952083	When you head back to airport tonight, go check and see what the...
0.0	0.366705658488	In her world, cap- and-trade would dominate, that we will destroy the economy in the name of helping the environment.
0.0	0.432598090309	And as a result of that, the shah of Iran came in, terrible dictator.
0.0	0.210455437277	Well, you know what?
0.0	0.249479504257	I've got five grandkids.
0.0	0.399112408918	Now, I'm the only person that's put out a detailed plan on how to deal with entitlements.
0.0	0.388673677381	And that's just not acceptable.
1.0	0.77032143368	You used to say that you were in favor of birthright citizenship, now you say that you are against it.
0.0	0.272259093676	But I think to suggest that I have voiced criticism, this blurb that you talk about, you know what the blurb said?
0.0	0.174608416965	You've got a bit of experience, I would imagine.
1.0	0.55657688845	And we'll save a trillion dollars over the next 10 years.
0.0	0.575769354544	And I spent my entire lifetime balancing federal budgets, growing jobs, the same in Ohio.
0.0	0.328964643454	It was never intended that the government should be in every aspect of our lives.
0.0	0.351103573785	So you know the New York Times and I don't have exactly have the warmest of relationships.
0.0	0.56986443002	But the greatest gains, percentage-wise, for people, are gonna be at the lower end of our plan, and here's why: because in addition to a general personal exemption, we are increasing the per-child tax credit for working families.
0.0	0.36880450403	I'm the only one on this stage that has a plan that would create jobs, cut taxes, balance the budget and can get it done because I'm realistic.
0.0	0.357513538085	Well, first of all, let's understand why we are even having this debate and why Donald tapped in to some of that anger that's out there about this whole issue.
0.0	0.599565288863	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.402846805775	Right there, right next to the plant.
0.0	0.425960311985	The second thing I said is we need to add reforms, not just increase the numbers, but add reforms.
0.0	0.403050739474	I go further in the plan that I've proposed, which has been called the toughest, most effective, comprehensive plan for reining in the other risks that the financial system could face.
0.0	0.210737555266	Look, that's who I stand up for.
0.0	0.280826020857	Caesar's -- excuse me -- Caesar's, the Rolls-Royce, as you know, is in bankruptcy.
0.0	0.161573870039	I have a feeling it's going to work out, actually.
0.0	0.324169969805	We need to have some coalitions in that part of the world to go after ISIS, but we also need to send a clear message.
0.0	0.383984592326	Putting Iranian troops right on the border of the Golan right next to Israel would be a nonstarter for me.

0.0	0.412739283914	Well, first of all, under President Jeb Bush, we would restore the strength of the military.
0.0	0.374931808112	So the answer is no and what Jeb said is absolutely correct.
0.0	0.663730513067	Yeah, but that -- because the math is, if you -- 5 percent of a million is a lot more than 5 percent of a thousand.

0.0	0.554602581674	You're talking about $2.7 trillion.
0.0	0.378943648752	And I traveled the country and learned how people made jobs.
0.0	0.210703569621	You've got to bring people together.
0.0	0.529439350072	Where basically, businesses now will have to pay a tax, both on the money they make, but they also have to pay taxes on the money that they pay their employees.
0.0	0.255605907653	And, I'll do that with the country.
0.0	0.238022038002	You know, I see a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist.
0.0	0.469983918134	Let me just say on taxes, how long have we been talking about tax reform in Washington, D.C.?
0.0	0.465759844531	But the best way to close this gap is to modernize higher education so Americans have the skills for those jobs.
0.0	0.409219128126	And I believe that not only Barney Frank, Paul Krugman, and others, have said that what I have proposed is the most effective.
0.0	0.304396720453	I am proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend.
0.0	0.335320742867	And I say that to Nikki.
0.0	0.540223523822	And you wanted to know the numbers, the Tax Foundation, which has scored every one of our plans, shows that this plan will allow the economy to generate 4.9 million jobs, to raise wages over 12 percent, and to generate 14 percent growth.
0.0	0.413475915057	That's fine.
0.0	0.368404241267	Think back to Garland, Texas.
0.0	0.397599738133	How can we beat an enemy if our commander-in-chief doesn't have the moral honesty and clarity to say that Islam has a problem, and that problem is radical Islam, to say they've got to condemn not generic acts of violence, but the individual murderers who are committing these acts of violence.
1.0	0.57477524897	Not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama and the big government economy, the median wage for women has dropped $733.
0.0	0.0958374281122	OK?
0.0	0.312006563041	That's exactly what we saw.
1.0	0.765360793836	Our military is a disaster.
0.0	0.4018406625	We would still have LGBT people who get married on Saturday and get fired on Monday.
0.0	0.557199289157	Last time I was elected governor, won a record margin in my state.
0.0	0.599565288863	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.496904926023	I have worked with President Obama for the last seven years.
0.0	0.445191147293	Here's my promise, at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country.
0.0	0.522473988091	And what you're going to see in Washington this week is establishment Republicans have made an agreement with the president to raise the debt ceiling in an unlimited fashion; no limit to the debt ceiling raise.
0.0	0.353168876534	The time to act is now.
0.0	0.41327369683	But that's not an accurate description of the plan.
0.0	0.387036898135	I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators -- back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.
0.0	0.536478493217	And that's an economy where ordinary Americans are working longer hours for low wagers.
0.0	0.369243343797	The fact of the matter is we the American people are not each other's enemies, it's those people who are trying to divide us who are the enemies.
0.0	0.305116109954	So we have a disagreement on this.
0.0	0.416486874967	If you look at the numbers, there are actually as many, if not more white communities that are truly being left behind and left out.
0.0	0.203593645682	I think we need to be very careful with tariffs, and here's why.
0.0	0.446444061646	And Lehman Brothers started it all.
0.0	0.388373355183	And yet when he won, he turned to me, trusting my judgment, my experience, to become secretary of state.
0.0	0.39424558591	I was a person who has dealt extensively with these homeland security issues.
1.0	0.389103337158	Now, on the floor of the Congress, the Washington establishment from both parties puts forward a bill that will explode the deficit.
0.0	0.470539600776	We will invest in education, and jobs for our kids, not incarceration and more jails.
0.0	0.419191575197	And we are going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fall.
0.0	0.397897356191	They don't provide any abortions in Louisiana.
0.0	0.306021934065	But the final thing I want to say about this is the following.
0.0	0.41858294796	Had that actually -- that same columnist wrote a column comparing me to an evil demonic spirit from the move, "It Follows" that jumps apparently from body to body possessing people.
0.0	0.511695013329	That's not why I ran for office.
1.0	0.464465317918	The Oregon study showed this.
0.0	0.123111465805	And that's what I intend to do.
1.0	0.705933530213	I'll tell you what else they're upset about: you're 50 or 51 years old, and some kid walks in and tells you you're out of work, and you don't know where to go and where to turn.
0.0	0.360917074079	You didn't see these kind of ideas being batted around, and being batted around in a way that's civil and smart and that's trying to help to inform the voter out there.
0.0	0.338074305911	I want to reverse that decline.
0.0	0.37562865327	Let me tell you that, in this country -- in this country, people are concerned about their economic future.
0.0	0.451378025689	And the people in New York fought and fought and fought, and we saw more death, and even the smell of death -- nobody understood it.
0.0	0.198052009786	Nobody can deny them.
0.0	0.220306325069	I'm proud that I gave him that advice.
0.0	0.347426416346	Now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world.
0.0	0.348732424758	It's a problem all over the world.
0.0	0.405140506381	I have created tens of thousands of jobs, and I'll be creating many millions of jobs if I'm given -- if I'm given the opportunity to be president.
0.0	0.367510515084	Some do, but many Americans are dying to have an opportunity to grow and to create something inside this economy.
0.0	0.413522356674	I like Marco too, and two years ago, he called me a conservative reformer that New Jersey needed.
0.0	0.275438861412	By the way, unlike our country where we're totally predictable and the enemy, whether it's ISIS or anybody else, they know exactly what we're doing because we have the wrong leadership.
0.0	0.444894901543	You lead and you produce results.
0.0	0.255907058739	He's a good guy, a smart guy, and he would be a heck of a lot better president than Hillary Rodham Clinton would ever be.
0.0	0.422944718269	Well, first of all the -- the plan gives people the option of -- of opting out.
0.0	0.197996461193	I'll say this.
0.0	0.382711357212	Our next president...
0.0	0.725849553844	$19 billion of tax cuts, 1.3 million jobs created.
0.0	0.462730627483	Number one, we have to create better paying jobs.
0.0	0.426315159991	Let me tell you, Donald Trump would be a president every day of the week and twice on Sunday, rather than Hillary.
0.0	0.404334365624	You know, we have a war on virtual everything -- race wars, gender wars, income wars, religious wars, age wars.
0.0	0.344097773292	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.286944451374	So don't put people in there if you don't want them bombed.
0.0	0.100362479424	No -- no...
0.0	0.404873771394	And then, after the war, this is the guy who, in fact, yes, you're right, he opened up relations with China, and now pushed various type of trade agreements, resulting in American workers losing their jobs as corporations moved to China.
0.0	0.470212396484	Remember, we have 645 federal agencies and sub-agencies.
0.0	0.411769012489	So let's set the facts straight.
1.0	0.459162181108	What Hillary Clinton's going to say, and has said before is, she wants to raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.145708235256	He does great.
0.0	0.378296031806	Liberty thrives when government is small.
0.0	0.395434076282	We need the lawyers(ph) off the back of the war fighters.
0.0	0.385690722637	The men and women on this stage have more ideas, more experience, more common sense than every participant in the Democratic debate.
0.0	0.437089852463	And this is what we have to -- I -- I've got to tell you, when wages don't rise -- and they haven't for a lot of families for a number of years -- it's very, very difficult for them.
1.0	0.858400388974	They don't want to pay 35 percent tax on the way back.
0.0	0.35265120183	But I think this is a worldwide -- that the entire world needs to come together to deal with this horrific refugee crisis we're seeing from Syria and Afghanistan, as well.
0.0	0.406340663436	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.330632618989	Neil, Neil -- can I say one thing about this.
0.0	0.271364583127	I just don't believe that this country's days are going to be deeply -- you know, going down.
0.0	0.502112475549	Bill, here's the interesting position on this.
0.0	0.254914596125	You know, they feel like if they don't have a lobbyist, if they're not wealthy, that somehow they don't get to play.
0.0	0.407396802279	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.256410320511	Because that's what we'd get if it were Jeb -- I tell you what, we don't need that.
0.0	0.598747022699	92 percent -- 92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama's first term belonged to women.
0.0	0.259175569534	You don't want to hear the answer.
0.0	0.287399903533	Where are you gonna clean it up?
0.0	0.29597003461	He undermines it.
0.0	0.304265407378	And I'm going to do everything I can to address distressed communities, whether they are communities of color, whether they are white communities, whether they are in any part of our country.
0.0	0.426740548329	Ours was intended to be a citizen government.
0.0	0.354333479818	It requires tax cuts, because that sends a message to the job creators that things are headed the right way.
0.0	0.393109504065	What we have to start thinking about, as leaders, particularly in government, is what can we do for the average American?
0.0	0.330128287449	That's what they do, whether it's the San Bernardino attack or if it's these tragedies that take place, I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is.
0.0	0.298564749466	Well, if the law would change, yeah.
0.0	0.342481972149	We will work with our Sunni allies.
0.0	0.344097773292	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.39665835603	Iran is sponsoring terrorism in many parts of the world, destabilizing areas.
0.0	0.321955153615	So I have nothing at all critical of him.
0.0	0.317217120193	I'll tell them that we're going to grow the economy so that we can give people better opportunities so they don't have to rely exclusively on benefit types of programs.
0.0	0.380360751882	Government causes a problem, and then government steps in to solve the problem.
0.0	0.453111937917	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.336859335522	So, yes, I do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white Americans -- particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have -- you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is.
0.0	0.405214557994	Judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.329436573475	But let me also tell you, one of the issues has got to be the integration of both community and police.
0.0	0.33889970123	Eradicate those and you fix Medicare and you've fixed America, its economy and you've made people's lives a heck of a lot better.
0.0	0.3056748022	And let me say this also.
0.0	0.31082174706	This will end.
0.0	0.226694339151	We will win on everything we do.
0.0	0.446965384777	Why are there five even bigger Wall Street banks now, instead of the ten we used to have on Wall Street?
0.0	0.304610443412	And together, we can solve these problems that hurt us and heal America.
0.0	0.204402615386	They're not my ideas, and I don't necessarily agree with all of them.
0.0	0.40522146615	And you don't go tell Muslim nations you want them to be part of a coalition when you have a leading candidate for president of the United States who insults their religion.
0.0	0.454131778822	It was a company that had grown into a bloated, inept bureaucracy that cost too much and delivered too little to customers and shareholders.

0.0	0.293064564981	Those three things put together are going to give confidence to job creators and you will begin to see wages rise.
0.0	0.465171184139	They were paid speeches.
0.0	0.469874539378	After those four years of looking back and being prepared, the preparation to be the most powerful individual in the world requires an extraordinary amount of work: not just having been the governor of the 12th largest economy in the world, which I might add, we added 1.5 million jobs during that period of time over that 2007 through 2014 period, a period when America was going through the most deep recession it had been through since the Great Depression.
0.0	0.407537195237	And that's how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America.
0.0	0.462499310908	And here's what the economic issue is.
0.0	0.348566458254	The question always is, what works better, the private marketplace or government?
0.0	0.470307693792	Number two, this isn't me saying it.
0.0	0.43543775854	I have many friends that deal with China.
0.0	0.245417711194	Here's the truth.
0.0	0.421617297391	The fact is -- and if for some reason he beats the rest of the field, he beats the rest of the field (inaudible).
0.0	0.183970184694	Hey look, he never had a chance.
0.0	0.420986226083	So listen, this is the difference between being a governor and a senator.
0.0	0.435312399233	They order planes, they make Boeing build their plant in China.
0.0	0.301788827994	I know a lot of Americans are angry about the economy.
0.0	0.389450845205	When I'm president of the United States, we are defending the Second Amendment, not undermining it the way Barack Obama does.
0.0	0.394646465073	Because this president has consistently underestimated the threat of ISIS.
0.0	0.435618656844	I am not a member of the political class.
0.0	0.339205178782	You know, back in September, my friend Donald said that he had had his lawyers look at this from every which way, and there was no issue there.
0.0	0.194739089229	Everybody is really doing some bad fact...
0.0	0.290023883593	And his explanation -- he said, "look, I'm from New York, that's what we believe in New York.
0.0	0.365374256167	Well, that just wasn't -- that just wasn't the fact, Senator.
0.0	0.658373318826	Of course, they would.
0.0	0.426289515527	Thanks for coming back to me, Maria.
0.0	0.345211562326	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.259678825629	And I think this has become something that needs to be looked at in terms of regulation.
0.0	0.352201406378	Let's quit making it a problem for them.
0.0	0.426153885688	Look, under President Obama and Secretary Clinton, they're working hard to change the American dream into the European nightmare.
0.0	0.454375384638	We're bringing corporate taxes down, bringing money back in, corporate inversions.
0.0	0.459957976222	I voted for Dodd-Frank, got an important amendment in it.
0.0	0.59891199556	And I ended a federal entitlement.
1.0	0.560517826551	You know, I left my medical practice and ran for office because I was concerned about an $18 trillion debt.
0.0	0.359095657936	So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States.
0.0	0.387610815962	I have proposed there be a Middle East NATO so that we can combine our allies there to stand up to Iranian expansion, and at the same time join together to begin to stop and this ISIL thing before it becomes an actual state.
0.0	0.472594684787	Judy, one area very briefly...
0.0	0.100362479424	It was the AFL-CIO.
0.0	0.342820922341	And if we capture any of them alive, they are getting a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know.
0.0	0.310961442349	I said, absolutely, you can still change the world.
0.0	0.100362479424	No.
0.0	0.290048078183	Why don't you wait in line?
0.0	0.441622590733	But a great nation like ours should not be in a position where elderly people are cutting their pills in half, where they don't have decent nutrition, where they can't heat their homes in the wintertime.
0.0	0.46446875312	Imagine a country where people are lifted out of poverty again.
0.0	0.386442066346	We can use it to break up the banks, if that's appropriate.
0.0	0.303596676707	I know every one.
0.0	0.450601523238	I'm putting up 100 percent of my own money.
0.0	0.479698237042	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.459593063608	And second, the international crisis we are facing is most dreadful and most dangerous.
0.0	0.431434334052	That's the end of the conversation.
0.0	0.495755015274	The business flat tax, they already impose their taxes on us, so there's no reciprocal...
0.0	0.393884874249	Secretary Clinton has been going around the country saying Bernie Sanders wants to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, people are going to lose their MedicAid, they're going to lose their CHIP program.
0.0	0.326254417632	You have to ban radical Islamic jihadists.
0.0	0.376601338244	Probably in terms of the applying for the job of president, a weakness would be not really seeing myself in that position until hundreds of thousands of people began to tell me that I needed to do it.
0.0	0.228661074502	Well, I'm glad you asked that, Maria.
0.0	0.462702943163	The simple fact is that the plane that's being build here is being sold to China.
0.0	0.364139113862	We have a serious problem with, as you know, with radical Islam.
0.0	0.417421394587	This campaign is not just about electing a president.
0.0	0.29883548335	The fact is, the reason why...
0.0	0.447120232786	..."diabetes, heart disease, cancer and Alzheimer's?"
0.0	0.309679401754	I asked my dad after -- obviously, when I found out about this.
0.0	0.438678060699	And that was the state of Texas.
0.0	0.346753406626	First and foremost, this issue has to be now more than anything else about keeping America safe.
0.0	0.48805715359	Doesn't hurt rich people if their bar of soap goes up ten cents, but it hurts the poor and the middle class.
0.0	0.144891419658	Okay.
0.0	0.14464734285	I'll talk to them.
0.0	0.529420784446	Well, first of all, I didn't say that the rate would be 10 percent.
0.0	0.401983426734	But I agree with Jeb, you can't just do this by growing the economy.
1.0	0.773023158662	That's wrong.
0.0	0.4163694377	Wait a minute, who in their 16th month?
0.0	0.197686547324	You know, I want to go back for a moment to what we were just talking about.
0.0	0.243411161944	I understand we can disagree on the path forward.
0.0	0.416853460386	I mean, that's just the bottom line.
0.0	0.367353433335	When it comes to ISIS, we will not weaken them, we will not degrade them, we will utterly and completely destroy ISIS
0.0	0.477171052204	Yes, I thought about running four years ago.
0.0	0.304641531355	... you're not going to have peace in Syria with Assad in charge.
0.0	0.213708353249	We have a tremendous problem.
0.0	0.27461228884	And, folks, we will.
0.0	0.39443937101	Just last week, we see saw two Iraqi refugees vetted using the same process the president says will work, that were arrested for being alleged ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.524421436571	We are lowering taxes on small business.
0.0	0.446225453538	This mandatory sentencing, a very bad idea.
0.0	0.417963737459	I am convinced because I see how he works with his attorney general, not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.445669348828	Obama broke every rule of negotiation.
0.0	0.346637831735	The answer is simple.
0.0	0.345160379791	So I think the better approach, the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against China economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage Barack Obama is doing to this economy.
0.0	0.360772436551	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.263778634781	It's why you see the pharmaceuticals getting together.
0.0	0.0430642640462	Thank you.
0.0	0.43699104639	So we do as the United States have to support our friends, our allies in Europe.
0.0	0.176365496867	I'm aware of that.
0.0	0.25308314217	But you know, we don't want to put everybody in the same category.
0.0	0.3584509996	And by the way, I hope we can end the trade embargo with Cuba as well.
0.0	0.344964060567	So look, in foreign policy -- in foreign policy, it's strength, but you've got to be cool.
0.0	0.302855660418	And God bless America.
0.0	0.257174584083	Here's the way you need to deal with it.
0.0	0.412795891385	Now, Donald...
0.0	0.194767259242	That's good.
0.0	0.476706422002	The B-52 is still operational as the long range bomber; it was inaugurated in the age of Harry Truman.
0.0	0.296693528024	We haven't done so.
0.0	0.260083532815	And kind of -- that's what I see our campaign is about right now.
0.0	0.169924286615	And, we come out here, and we do our thing.
0.0	0.42822307341	We can't just allow it to continue on its current path the way that Hillary Clinton wants to do because there'll be major reductions in benefits in the next decade if we do nothing.
0.0	0.404698634324	It's actually evidence of the bias that exists in the American media today.
1.0	0.526293753323	The government stole it, and spent it a long time ago...
0.0	0.45429856643	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government in setting up -- retirement plans.
0.0	0.403227625443	Imagine how hard it is for these people out there that are making 40, 50, $60,000 a year, and they're trying to provide for their families at a time when this economy is not growing.
0.0	0.619069155913	So the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced: a simple flat tax, 10 percent for individuals, and a 16 percent business flat tax, you abolish the IRS...
0.0	0.494866954632	We owned a liquor store, restaurant, bar and we lived in the back.
0.0	0.154069091555	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.208999879925	You're right.
0.0	0.480119641189	Here is where we are with public education.
0.0	0.250546540453	That is who I'm fighting for.
0.0	0.458914012392	As a senator, yes, I was a senator.
0.0	0.385541486128	ISIS came in, and now occupies significant territory in Libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold.
0.0	0.435019431173	You are working at McDonald's?
0.0	0.38907790453	But I was born here.
0.0	0.339055025446	They have a responsibility, as well.
0.0	0.389326241363	If we -- if we don't act now, we are going to be the first generation in American history that leaves our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.516916392384	Whose fault is it that Medicare is broken, out of money, that Social Security is broken, out of money?
0.0	0.391486114791	This president has failed, and when I'm in the Oval Office, police officers will know that they will have the support of the president of the Untied States.
0.0	0.345465719425	It was a back sacrifice, and I have to hand it to Ben.
0.0	0.359285989715	There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies.
0.0	0.365493161199	And I'm going to tell you this, we need to use the benefit of our law enforcement people across this country, combined with our intelligence people across this country.
0.0	0.369670937264	He just writes out an executive order.
0.0	0.22304622891	They're off to China.
0.0	0.393894198851	I'm the only one on this stage who has a plan that's actually reduced -- actually going to reduce immigration.
0.0	0.410104325692	We need to be very well aware of the fact that China and Russia are using technology to attack us, just as ISIS is using technology to recruit those who would murder American citizens.
0.0	0.285641280345	And I'll allow putting that tariff or whatever he's saying here...
0.0	0.352054481007	As an outsider, I tackled H.P.
0.0	0.400057184111	Carl said, "no, no -- " but he's somebody -- these are the kind of people that we should use to negotiate and not the China people that we have who are political hacks who don't know what they're doing and we have problems like this.
0.0	0.518308413627	Two points.
0.0	0.501378183499	Back in 2004, one of my predecessors to the Senate by the name of Bob Graham, a Democrat, ran for president missing over 30 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.4032788639	The agreement on humanitarian relief now needs to be implemented, because there are enclaves that are literally filled with starving people throughout Syria.
0.0	0.31977141365	And I went there, and for 16 years, I fought the insiders and was able to get things done.
0.0	0.394436342014	We have this enormous mismatch because we have smaller and smaller families.
0.0	0.401732962534	Please do not tell me that in this country, if -- and here's the if -- we have the courage to take on the drug companies, and have the courage to take on the insurance companies, and the medical equipment suppliers, if we do that, yes, we can guarantee health care to all people in a much more cost effective way.
0.0	0.372727681768	Big and powerful use big and powerful government to their advantage.
1.0	0.849202192195	I think under President Obama we have seen a lot of advances, the Affordable Care Act has helped more African Americans than any other group to get insurance, to be taken care of, but we also know a lot more than we did.
0.0	0.36204143681	Well, we've gotta turn the economy around for people who are struggling.
0.0	0.41945773442	This is a bad deal.
1.0	0.734927575119	And let us be clear that every proposal that I have introduced has been paid for.
0.0	0.410621293991	In my family, my dad fled oppression in Cuba to come to America.
0.0	0.437826185751	It's the strongest pro-worker immigration plan.
0.0	0.399288931809	And let me tell you, ISIS and terrorists do not get their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.100362479424	No.
0.0	0.282223161236	We can't do this unilaterally.
0.0	0.279979102523	I would change them.
0.0	0.400680587397	I stood on the stage and watched Marco in rather indignantly, look at Governor Bush and say, someone told you that because we're running for the same office, that criticizing me will get you to that office.
0.0	0.357189859353	This is about more than replacing a D with an R. We need a leader who will help us take our government back.
0.0	0.495038410214	They are employing themselves, they are potentially employing others.
0.0	0.351167603842	And we can take that message and that formula to Washington to lift every single American to a better life.
0.0	0.452505224629	And at the end of the day, it was the president's decision.
0.0	0.410298762234	A person who, in fact, has a long experience in foreign-policy issues, which is different from many of the other governors and prospective governors who are running.
0.0	0.287709495813	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.391594415274	But, here is a pledge I've made throughout this campaign, and it's really not a very radical pledge.
0.0	0.394575852626	There's a big question mark on your head.
0.0	0.100362479424	Again...
0.0	0.231573608034	As you too know, I know I built a very great company.
0.0	0.405004068746	Whether it's welfare reform and getting something back for the hard-earned taxpayers; whether it's engaging in Pentagon reform and taking on the big contractors that were charging thousands of dollars for hammers and screw drivers and ripping us off; or whether it's taking on the special interests in the nursing home industry in Ohio, so that mom and dad can have the ability to stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.
0.0	0.415628724695	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.370225907936	And this is not an endeavor that rewards that.
0.0	0.312143737934	We need to use our technological advantages, because what we've warned of is an international guerrilla movement that threatens this country.
0.0	0.264587509621	I think I'm going to win fair and square (inaudible) to win this way.
0.0	0.361642085143	But getting back to Martha's question about how we end dependency, do we have to have a cultural change?
0.0	0.311152306779	It's very important we focus on the threats we face today, and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in.
0.0	0.386213586919	And, look, I think it's important to look at what the most important counterterrorism judgment of the first four years of the Obama administration was, and that was the very difficult decision as to whether or not to advise the president to go after bin Laden.
0.0	0.436058872754	It's not responsible.
0.0	0.486816573228	So, I would pass legislation outlawing abortion after 20 weeks.
0.0	0.323541340083	Our country doesn't win anymore.
0.0	0.189948538062	That's who's in my mind
0.0	0.272215730996	It is a complicated relationship.
0.0	0.471970126149	Bernie Sanders has already said it.
0.0	0.312688839675	But I look at this country today, and I look at how divided we are, I look at how politicians are always posturing and issuing sound bites but never solving problems.
0.0	0.446178156581	In the crowd today is Major General James Livingston, who's the co-chairman of my campaign here in South Carolina, a Medal of Honor recipient.
0.0	0.385623216682	We have to put the personnel on that border in the right places; you have to put the strategic fencing in place; and you have to have aviation assets that fly all the way from Tijuana to El Paso to Brownsville, Texas -- 1,933 miles looking down 24/7, with the technology to be able to identify what individuals are doing, and ID when they are in obviously illegal activities or suspicious activities, and quick response teams come.
0.0	0.464391010985	Both Donald and Jeb have good points, and there is a middle ground.
0.0	0.12135430135	I'm ready.
0.0	0.541920035107	Senator Sanders voted against it at that time.
0.0	0.387451650947	The simple fact is one of the ways, Maria, to solve the problem you described is narrow the number of people coming by family petitioning to what every other country has so that we have the best and the brightest that come to our country.
0.0	0.201755446638	OK, good.
1.0	0.809517312331	But I want to -- I want to follow up on something having to do with leadership, because, you know, today Senator Sanders said that President Obama failed the presidential leadership test.
0.0	0.338892859093	Let me -- let me answer your question on the Sun-Sentinel editorial today.
0.0	0.456147052372	Bill, I defeated Mario Cuomo.
0.0	0.286454984943	Well, let me -- let me first of all talk a little bit about my experience.
0.0	0.211034865864	I'm going to get a response to that, Neil.
0.0	0.304202278046	I just want to remind you, people paid their money.
0.0	0.322393789426	This issue now has to be about stopping ISIS entering the United States, and when I'm president we will.
0.0	0.172468164774	I know what it's like to owe that money, and we've worked hard.
0.0	0.483229997027	I've said I'm looking at a couple of different ways, one which you mentioned, Senator, but also trying to expand the existing tax to passive income that wealthy people have so that we do get more revenue into the Social Security Trust Fund.
0.0	0.27353870829	We will renew America if we work together, and I am totally confident that we will.
0.0	0.219591965477	See, they don't like that.
0.0	0.167110421601	Or that we're just going to be great?
0.0	0.377964808526	In fact, that's part of the problem.
0.0	0.392914870284	It will cause the economy to grow, to explode, to create more jobs.
0.0	0.226193041309	Everybody just needs to get used to it.
0.0	0.385396625716	And they consorted with Barack Obama to steal from Social Security.
0.0	0.328710807888	Well, I respectfully disagree.
0.0	0.0430642640462	Thank you.
0.0	0.337167204752	The agreement on a cease-fire, though, is something that has to be implemented more quickly than the schedule that the Russians agreed to.
0.0	0.465463526796	The reason that I -- I hate them so much is because every single regulation costs in terms of goods and services.
0.0	0.47606094149	You do the arithmetic.
0.0	0.461108284149	We have a country of laws.

0.0	0.258028066266	Just tell them that, you put people in there, we're going to bomb them.
0.0	0.160366010846	I think he would have been right.
0.0	0.4084013536	That expertise needs to spread all across the government and there needs to be much more cooperation with our private sector.
0.0	0.217522405077	I think that would have been right, as well.
0.0	0.404691918765	I came to Washington, D.C. in 1990.
0.0	0.347271731247	First of all, yes, we've stolen.
0.0	0.168632699712	I think it's -- yeah, I think it's a one-two punch.
0.0	0.372971759413	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, the slower the economy becomes.
0.0	0.364295689549	Everybody on this stage is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.195603760299	Not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.246803897773	As far as the wall is concerned, we're going to build a wall.
0.0	0.342865056648	We need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources, but from sources overseas, that can be a real-time fusion effort to get information where it's needed.
0.0	0.194767259242	It's good to be with you.
0.0	0.467666106503	But in terms of shutting down the government, I don't think President Obama should choose to shut down the government simply to send taxpayer dollars to this group that has been caught, I believe, breaking the law, but also offending our values and our ethics.
0.0	0.0901229354617	How do I know this?
0.0	0.283207857356	Lots of people will say lots of different things about me in this campaign and others, but the one thing they've never said about me is that I'm misunderstood.
0.0	0.246735136267	His family certainly believes that.
0.0	0.348871598271	I happen to believe that Putin is doing what he is doing because his economy is increasingly in shambles and he's trying to rally his people in support of him.
0.0	0.228065693529	That's what I'm working towards.
0.0	0.168337142091	Well, I want to know, did you win?
1.0	0.58257750965	In 2008, Barack Obama missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes, and the same newspaper endorsed him again.
0.0	0.331311459685	Any connection to the fact that not one Republican candidate for president thinks and agrees with the scientific community that climate change is real and that we have got to transform our energy system?

0.0	0.35009567847	I did a couple of speeches for them, I do speeches for other people.
0.0	0.468960318984	That's why I'm running for office because when I become president of the United States, on my first day in office we are going to repeal every single one of his unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.380540955075	Check it out.
0.0	0.402429721845	And we do need China -- Donald's right about North Korea.
0.0	0.53746524655	Low income people who are not involved in the political process.
0.0	0.251306971068	You really can't.
0.0	0.344112781495	But if we elect the right person -- if you elect me -- we will turn this country around, we will reclaim the American dream and this nation will be stronger and greater than it has ever been.
0.0	0.471352371041	It's why you see Walgreens buying Rite Aid.

0.0	0.292021297997	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.400856924509	They've contacted the trafficking networks in the Western Hemisphere to get people in through the southern border.
0.0	0.214258087977	What I said was that I think that Dr. Carson's ideas are good ideas.

0.0	0.411324408778	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.388986065604	Every progressive economist who has analyzed that says that the numbers don't add up, and that's a promise that cannot be kept, and it's really important now that we are getting into the rest of the country that both of us are held to account for explaining what we are proposing because, especially with healthcare, this is not about math.
0.0	0.512720439018	We inherited a system that was set up during World War II; 170 million Americans get health insurance right now through their employers.
0.0	0.441393208661	Well, this is one of the reasons why Tom Perkins and I had disagreements in the boardroom, Becky.
0.0	0.433922807996	If I become President because we'll have a Constitutional Amendment to require a federally balanced budget so they will do their job.
0.0	0.163224768977	It never happens.
0.0	0.444762903522	So conservatives actually do come out of Manhattan, including William F. Buckley and others, just so you understand.
0.0	0.269245709984	He needs to recognize that those kinds of things are in fact an existential threat to us.
0.0	0.406632173465	Just like getting rid of Medicare and Medicaid.

0.0	0.197745239195	I can do that.
0.0	0.384939019017	And that's why I've offered a specific program to the people of America tonight to address the fundamental problem of getting our country growing again, getting our economy growing, wages up, opportunities for people.
0.0	0.289246427994	Do we have answer for that?
0.0	0.200782034299	I'm going to keep making sure that everything I've done, everything that I stand for is going to be well known.
0.0	0.334185767867	It's Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.47519801372	Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns.
0.0	0.335041259525	Because, folks, at the end of the day, the country needs healed.
0.0	0.339582795131	I'd also go after these sanctuary cities, do everything we can to make sure that we are not -- that we are actually prosecuting and cutting off funding for cities that are harboring illegal aliens, and then finally making sure the IRS is not going after conservative or religious groups.
0.0	0.482363249746	Here's -- apart from the -- apart from the higher prices on consumers and people are living paycheck to paycheck, apart from that, there will be retaliation.
0.0	0.53161983363	It's called the value added tax.
1.0	0.812936835979	And Iranian wise guys having guns to their heads.
0.0	0.439333425715	I have the opportunity not just to run, but to win in the deep blue state of New York three times.
0.0	0.478369684158	Well, first of all, when we talk about the Import Export Bank, it's time to clean up corporate welfare.
0.0	0.402560863725	And when the president of the United States gets out to speak about it, does he support police officers?
0.0	0.283286119311	My plan would sweep all of them into a regulatory framework so we can try to get ahead of what the next problems might be.
0.0	0.158727432747	You just want to...
0.0	0.344539616714	At the same time, law enforcement understands there are people in the community who not only think that the system doesn't work for them, but works against them.
0.0	0.480806499606	You find a Democrat that's for cutting taxes -- cutting spending ten dollars, I'll give them a warm kiss.
0.0	0.41310706379	Such a nasty -- such a nasty question, but thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.381101333258	We have got to demilitarize local police departments so they do not look like occupying armies.
0.0	0.454700517805	This is a humanitarian catastrophe.
0.0	0.379389998803	As far as Mark is concerned, as far as the visas are concerned, if we need people, they have -- it's fine.
0.0	0.409274138228	But we also need to reform Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.389430929368	And we will join the rest of the other -- the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families.
0.0	0.429637217262	This president allows lawlessness throughout this country.
0.0	0.387955055684	I want to speak to all our fighting men and women.
0.0	0.304988778585	I know some people like to say, "well, this is free money."
0.0	0.556079386898	And here's the last piece...
0.0	0.345688293312	What we need to do is destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.132021685849	She was right.
0.0	0.455602760247	I certainly agree with FDR for all the reasons Senator Sanders said.
0.0	0.456461309427	Now, the proposal that I have outlined, you know, should be familiar to you, because it is what essentially Barack Obama campaigned on in 2008.
0.0	0.321291259777	Because when government gets big and powerful, the big feel like they need to get even bigger to deal with all that power, and meanwhile, the small and the powerless -- in this case, 1,590 community banks -- go out of business.
0.0	0.259180118118	But, let me tell you who not to blame.
0.0	0.279979102523	I would change them.
0.0	0.426790915326	In my case, whether it's health care, or getting us to debt-free tuition, or moving us toward paid family leave, I have been very specific about where I would raise the money, how much it would cost, and how I would move this agenda forward.
0.0	0.376361209669	We now have much more information about what must be done to fix our criminal justice system.
1.0	0.606740880412	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.401715374629	I was not that candidate.
0.0	0.411199094589	Now, who are the people who are hurt by that?
0.0	0.379753541191	It should be what are your substantive positions...
0.0	0.397048648953	Now, thank God, my father was invited to a Bible study and became born again and he came back to my mom and me and we were raised together.
0.0	0.41303367952	But many, many people did.
0.0	0.403647591141	Listen, in any Republican primary, everyone is going to say they support the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.300548633566	Good question, but I want to tell you, my great concern is that we are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job.
0.0	0.336080333207	Where did that spirit come from in America?
0.0	0.346211796906	The government ought to wear a striped shirt and just make sure the game...
0.0	0.32782682782	I think maybe my greatest weakness is that I trust people too much.
0.0	0.389770903928	So whether it's green cards or any other form of entry into America, when I'm president if we do not know who you are or why you are coming, you are not going to get into the United States of America.
0.0	0.43619618736	We're going to suspend and repeal every executive order, every regulation that cost American jobs and is -- is -- is impacting our freedom.
0.0	0.569506208216	We will use those proceeds, a hundred billion a year, to invest in rebuilding our infrastructure.
0.0	0.461140614269	When I was 21, my mom died.
0.0	0.260451870972	I've seen plenty of other people follow up?
0.0	0.391411611428	You know, a minute ago, Neil asked: What has President Obama do -- done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns?
0.0	0.100362479424	How about this?
0.0	0.204064294549	And guess what, in 2011, I got a deal...
0.0	0.447503774266	I lead the opposition against it.
0.0	0.439327127296	And what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice.
0.0	0.336059492725	I will continue to have tremendous admiration and respect for Governor Bush.
0.0	0.263527997379	We could overthrow Assad tomorrow if we wanted to.
0.0	0.481792832875	...Or, even some famous Colorado brownies.
0.0	0.323633182521	It's like a 400 pound man saying, "I'm going to go on a diet, but I'm eating a sack of Krispy Kremes before I do."
0.0	0.293682888305	So there's a lot of balanced interests.
0.0	0.42120349486	I mean, literally, the Senate -- what is it, like a French work week?
0.0	0.476857074312	In the first day in office, my first executive order, I revoked every one of the executive orders that he had -- he had enacted over the prior 12 years.
0.0	0.285059984457	I've got a track record.
0.0	0.352921028708	Now, on to your substantive question.
0.0	0.402856809903	I would like to start with a basic.
0.0	0.370730314919	And I make a lot more than the average American.
0.0	0.43046290199	Donald Trump actually seized on it when he talked about immigration.
0.0	0.286891706814	We don't need to add new rules, we need to make sure the FBI does its job.
0.0	0.359458512761	I have gone time and time again to take on the vested interests who would keep women's health care decisions the province of the government instead of women ourselves.
0.0	0.519928982692	Here's my second problem.
1.0	0.84519070646	Ted Cruz, you used to say you supported doubling the number of green cards, now you say that you're against it.
0.0	0.386163194884	And if you go to my Web site, berniesanders.com, what you find is not only going to help lead the opposition to that war, but much of what I feared would happen when I spoke on the floor of the House, in fact, did happen in terms of the instability that occurred.
0.0	0.336109515435	Let me say, I read that editorial today with a great amusement.
0.0	0.310807001648	When I'm president of the United States we are getting rid of Obamacare and we are rebuilding our military.
0.0	0.437468534362	And I said, "Didn't you resent America for not letting you be with your father in those formative and very threatening years?"
0.0	0.428338759454	It's a blessing that we're living longer, so we have to increase the retirement age to reflect that blessing.
0.0	0.311441690013	This is incredibly complicated, because we've got Iran as a big player, in addition to Russia.
1.0	0.722540802112	Someone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander in chief and someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi can never be president of the United States.
0.0	0.268288501993	Let me just -- let me respond.
0.0	0.38573896363	But the Democrats are going to bring a lawsuit, and you have to have certainty.
0.0	0.30567587361	Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, they're no better.
0.0	0.185643882589	See when you're a senator, what you get to do is just talk and talk and talk.
0.0	0.248303926728	So there are people watching tonight in business.
0.0	0.502144411493	I can tell you, after spending seven years as a former federal prosecutor, right after 9/11, dealing with this issue.
0.0	0.377416256091	He just writes out an order, executive order.
0.0	0.441575217909	You can trust me to do the following: that when I get on change with Hillary Clinton, we won't be debating about the science, we'll be debating about the solutions.
0.0	0.202636930964	We have work to do, and we now know a lot more than we ever did before.
0.0	0.151431142538	They're never going to let it happen.
0.0	0.39263474032	It's the only way you fix Medicare, the only way you fix Social Security.
0.0	0.329131825216	But I like to be unpredictable so that people don't know exactly... (LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.431442739586	...in the world for people...
0.0	0.36214536593	Well, this goes to the question you were just asking.
0.0	0.351624134609	It is undermining American democracy.
0.0	0.334467775594	The only way to figure that out is to go back to getting the intelligence community the funding and the tools that it needs to be able to keep America safe.
0.0	0.175220733819	He was such a nice guy.
0.0	0.46133498852	People with a high school education or less are not even living as long as their parents lived.
0.0	0.336419202156	This is one of the great tragedies in our country today.
0.0	0.409274731552	And we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid.
0.0	0.335761560801	Look, every time the Federal Government gets engaged in something it gets worse.
0.0	0.478567496774	Well, first of all, this is an issue that's been debated now for 30 years.
0.0	0.386631410558	Jeb Bush says we've got to be willing to lose the primary in order to win the general.
0.0	0.469677553874	But view is those trade policies have enabled corporate America to shut down in this country, throw millions of people out on the street.
0.0	0.0901229354617	And how do I know it?
0.0	0.295032319501	I will begin tomorrow to filibuster it.
0.0	0.452207918444	Do you think that the Chinese, if they had a 45 percent tariff imposed on all their imports wouldn't retaliate and start buying Airbus?
0.0	0.458631457913	Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the co-chair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat.
0.0	0.374039146205	So if you happen to be right, you could get the top job at the end of the day.
0.0	0.379428674066	That is not protected religious belief.
0.0	0.381032359064	This is absolutely disgusting, and revolts the conscience of the nation.
0.0	0.159266332141	Because I've done it.
0.0	0.402449649991	They explode the bomb, we have an electromagnetic pulse.
0.0	0.398152781525	It's the most exceptional country the world has ever known.
0.0	0.364207815978	I think to be commander in chief in the 21st century requires someone who understands how the economy works, someone who understands how the world works and who's in it; I know more world leaders on the stage today than anyone running, with the possible exception of Hillary Clinton; understands bureaucracies, how to cut them down to size and hold them accountable; and understands technology, which is a tool, but it's also a weapon that's being used against us.
0.0	0.300718369738	I had to work my way through school.
0.0	0.529803872998	The number of women --
0.0	0.428909277355	Kissinger was one of those people during the Vietnam era who talked about the domino theory.
0.0	0.342494594832	Could I -- could I bring something up here, because I'm a constituent of the senator and I helped him and I expected that he would do constituent service, which means that he shows up to work.
0.0	0.348064442675	That is the fight we have to have, and we have to undo a whole set of things that President Obama has done that get at the heart of his disrespect and disregard for too many Americans.
0.0	0.42142048119	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.369292856478	But you ought to acknowledge the government doesn't do a very good job at it.
0.0	0.335846038611	We have got to destroy their training camps over there before they can attack us here.
0.0	0.386027900085	But also where it's affordable, solar, wind in Iowa has become very affordable and it makes sense.
0.0	0.254561791211	I got the briefings.
0.0	0.415529855192	As president of the United States, I will be a commander in chief that will have the back of the military.
0.0	0.176744478964	Yes, I might feel more comfortable.
0.0	0.434807155459	I've also called for the end of family detention, for the end of privately-run detention centers, along with private prisons, which I think are really against the common good and the rule of law.
0.0	0.416091414675	And that's why Ronald Reagan said that it was a blindfold.
0.0	0.327026111137	The government has tried it their way.
0.0	0.373886282404	We're going to lose Social Security and Medicare if Republicans and Democrats do not come together and find a solution like Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.379205332553	You don't have seven children and bring them into this world if you're not optimistic about the future of this country.
0.0	0.397074131004	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, it is demonstrably true...
0.0	0.276900190849	So I know Secretary Kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease-fire up as quickly as possible.
0.0	0.396125599894	There's nobody out there looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.501228831937	One of them is a statewide use of deadly force.
0.0	0.271744961899	That is a bad deal and an evil situation, and presidents have looked the other way.
0.0	0.316100390289	We're going dark when it comes to detecting the next attack.
