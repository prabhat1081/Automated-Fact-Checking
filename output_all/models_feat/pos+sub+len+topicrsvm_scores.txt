0.0	0.374606572967	I mean, what we had was something the government made -- basically a bag of gas -- that cut loose, destroyed everything in its path, left thousands of people powerless, but they couldn't get rid of it because we had too much money invested in it, so we had to keep it.
0.0	0.597159361673	I'm wearing a Trump tie tonight.

0.0	0.126463034027	I think we should be for free trade but I think fair trade.
0.0	0.281252005645	... and here's the critical point, Maria -- the business flat tax enables us to abolish the corporate income tax, the death tax, the Obamacare taxes, the payroll taxes, and they're border-adjustable, so every export pays no taxes whatsoever.
0.0	0.282192784739	They say, " well, we don't really have control."

0.0	0.432020377046	It's going to happen in this country, there are going to be further attacks.
0.0	0.489376944767	Now, the fact is, what this president has done is invited Russia to play an even bigger role, bring in Vladimir Putin to negotiate getting those chemical weapons back from Assad, yet what do we have today?
0.0	0.254184205079	... replacing dependency with opportunity.
0.0	0.445546732352	Maria, I assume that I can respond to that.
0.0	0.126341900246	You're not going to even allow them to come to our country?

0.0	0.24486070471	We have Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view.
0.0	0.423066864503	Lawrence Tribe and (inaudible) from Harvard -- of Harvard, said that there is a serious question as to whether or not Ted can do this.

0.0	0.451564705744	I think President Obama has set a great example.
0.0	0.937861272525	We inherited a system that was set up during World War II; 170 million Americans get health insurance right now through their employers.
0.0	0.390748562855	But judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.252403690493	I'm happy to answer the question...
0.0	0.956196754734	Just last week, we see saw two Iraqi refugees vetted using the same process the president says will work, that were arrested for being alleged ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.897739428873	We warned about the 9/11 attack before the 9/11 attack occurred.
0.0	0.52854034549	I am not a member of the political class.
0.0	0.122986210503	First of all, yes, we've stolen.
0.0	0.851364748547	I voted against the war in Iraq because I listened very carefully to what President Bush and Vice President Cheney had to say and I didn't believe them.
0.0	0.48096679318	And she and I looked at the same evidence coming from the Bush administration regarding Iraq.
0.0	0.357271827383	And we are not England.
0.0	0.550130554403	I have yet to see a proposal that you're describing that the -- raising the cap would apply to passive income.
0.0	0.392755431716	You know, I completely agree with Senator Sanders.
0.0	0.330495514083	They understand the vulnerabilities we have on the southern border.

0.0	0.53791939163	Roads, bridges, water systems, wastewater plants, who denies that?
0.0	0.511084274249	You have to lead.
0.0	0.63338810093	On top of that, there is a business flat tax of 16 percent.
0.0	0.671490229231	But let me also tell you, one of the issues has got to be the integration of both community and police.
0.0	0.32971176467	That's what he is.
0.0	0.239267912273	And secondly, we should pass the legislation that I've introduced...
0.0	0.427949388917	They expect to have it.
1.0	0.621958831088	And this is not the first time that he has criticized President Obama.
0.0	0.579370912719	We're bringing corporate taxes down, bringing money back in, corporate inversions.
0.0	0.146090795342	Just know where you want to go, stick to your guts.
0.0	0.333282749256	No, he doesn't.
0.0	0.33513258298	I have no idea.
0.0	0.114397560403	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.52409792022	About every two weeks, he holds a press conference talking about how he can't wait to restrict people's access to guns.
0.0	0.810771961302	I've seen so much of it - a Soviet Union, the coming down of a wall, the issues that we saw around the world in Central America, the potential spread of communism, and 9/11 and Gulf War.
0.0	0.349943025034	And when we live by those laws and we treat everybody equally under the law, that's when people feel good about being Americans.
1.0	0.825642533939	Americans haven't had a raise in 15 years.
0.0	0.455437858617	Madam Secretary, that is a low blow.
0.0	0.665527259734	Now that applies universally to giant corporations that with lobbyists right now are not paying taxes, and as small business.
0.0	0.961602402633	We were one of two states to go to AAA bond rating, and our government spending was far less than the spending in people's income.
0.0	0.0828922642168	What else we can do is that we should believe in science.
0.0	0.702839387232	I want to find out why those two young people -- those two horrible young people in California when they shot the 14 people, killed them -- people they knew, people that held the wedding reception for them.
0.0	0.743290954077	And I'm the only one up on this stage who back in April put forward a detailed entitlement reform plan that will save over $1 trillion, save Social Security, save Medicare, and avoid this -- avoid what Hillary Rodham Clinton will do to you.
0.0	0.910644835808	So what we have tried to do and what President Obama succeeded in doing was to build on the health care system we have, get us to 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.602807669216	My name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.251751918467	Yeah.
0.0	0.530724747992	You know, coal miners and their families who helped turn on the lights and power our factories for generations are now wondering, has our country forgotten us?
0.0	0.566670985398	I would note, just for a historic aside, somebody told me earlier today we've had like 200 presidential primary debates, and this is the first time there have been a majority of women on the stage.
0.0	0.17477952774	But a great nation like ours should not be in a position where elderly people are cutting their pills in half, where they don't have decent nutrition, where they can't heat their homes in the wintertime.
0.0	0.217103823818	And let me say this also.
0.0	0.45730881459	Credibility counts.
0.0	0.366096489919	Actually a close friend.
0.0	0.631981736614	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.110506034123	And just so -- if I could, because he insulted a lot of people.
0.0	0.707040627436	People with a high school education or less are not even living as long as their parents lived.
0.0	0.359458667126	John?
0.0	0.729088972933	In 2011, the sequester was passed as a reform to slow down the rate of government.
0.0	0.533631647143	When you became president, you had a Democratic Congress and a filibuster-proof Democratic Senate.
0.0	0.529435046115	This issue is not about that anymore.
0.0	0.236451125617	I think he would have been right.
0.0	0.162504100497	...Then I'll buy you a tequila...
0.0	0.842028495194	The isolationist is the one who wants to continue to follow a foreign policy that has fewer democracies today than when Barack Obama came into office around the world.
0.0	0.5	First of all, John got lucky with a thing called fracking, OK?
0.0	0.144180700352	At the same time, law enforcement understands there are people in the community who not only think that the system doesn't work for them, but works against them.
0.0	0.0705322321406	And there's a reason why Hillary's supporters are echoing Donald's attacks on me, because Hillary...
0.0	0.515954938137	This is not entitlement, it's not welfare.
0.0	0.471471356489	Not all of his top national security advisors agreed with that.
0.0	0.292229315874	What I believe is the United States, in fact, should join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee healthcare to all people.
0.0	0.4423871751	In fact, Ronald Reagan's treasury, when Ronald Reagan's treasury looked at the vat tax, you know what they found?

0.0	0.185955530501	That expertise needs to spread all across the government and there needs to be much more cooperation with our private sector.
0.0	0.0523670059883	... you know, the -- the -- the fact of the matter is -- you know, if we fix the taxation system, make it absolutely fair, and get rid of the incredible regulations -- because every regulation is a tax, it's a -- on goods and services.
0.0	0.552253622203	We're going to save Social Security, and we're going to save Medicare.
0.0	0.0535608137774	I know we have a president who wants to do whatever he wants to do, and take his pen and his phone and just tell everybody what he thinks is best.

0.0	0.308128338801	No.
0.0	0.633185297629	So this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement.
0.0	0.188597571707	You know, I find it really quite fascinating some of the president's proclamations.
0.0	0.432267938327	And when it began, we had no political organization, no money, and not much name recognition outside of the state of Vermont.
0.0	0.555605706188	This campaign is not just about electing a president.
0.0	0.195425763155	...

0.0	0.44824521883	And we can take that message and that formula to Washington to lift every single American to a better life.
0.0	0.401018555262	Larry Kudlow is an example, who I have a lot of respect for, who loves my tax plan.
0.0	0.268171748209	Let me concur with the secretary, no question women's rights are under fierce attack all over this country.
0.0	0.141619542653	We have a world that's out of control and has grown dangerous and a president that is weakening our military and making our foreign policy unstable and unreliable in the eyes of our allies.
0.0	0.102245697443	And if you elect me president, we will bring incredible growth back to this country.
0.0	0.514314816621	You spend the money today and then you hope you're going to save money tomorrow.
0.0	0.00717726106628	... the fact is, Neil, let's think about -- let's think about -- and I want to maybe -- I hope the president is watching tonight, because here's what I'd like to tell him.
0.0	0.315971950482	You don't want to hear the answer.
0.0	0.5	And in that interview, he explained his views on a whole host of issues that were very, very different from the views he's describing now.
0.0	0.30241969435	And that's what I hear from some people, "we'll do nothing and it will just be fixed."
0.0	0.343259290693	What we have to do is end over-policing in African- American neighborhoods.
0.0	0.5	This was a question on entitlements.
0.0	0.368390406545	You see, you have one side, the Democrats, and with immigration, all they care about is votes.
0.0	0.318024629861	Republicans and Democrats alike believe this.
0.0	0.663855287981	Donald is right that China is running over President Obama like he is a child, President Obama is not protecting American workers and we are getting hammered.
0.0	0.29939050308	That's not the role of the government.
0.0	0.251027256166	We need to make sure that we keep the country safe.
0.0	0.0808619208787	And I think together we will make progress.
0.0	0.191346636905	But I would probably have my children run it with my executives and I wouldn't ever be involved because I wouldn't care about anything but our country, anything.
0.0	0.052175738562	And as far as the Syrians are concerned, Al-Hasakah province, perfect place.
0.0	0.448282738596	I'm very proud that NARAL endorsed me because when it comes to it we need a leader on women's issues.

0.0	0.389783008468	We didn't spend any.
0.0	0.0648400265202	Somebody who, yes, votes right, but much more than that, leads the efforts to protect the hard-fought gains that women have made, that, make no mistake about it, are under tremendous attack, not just by the Republican presidential candidates but by a whole national effort to try to set back women's rights.
0.0	0.285300027681	And sadly, in America today, in our economy, a whole lot of those poor people are African-American.
0.0	0.476595842276	And in fact, in Obama administration, we did not meet with anybody without conditions.
0.0	0.300336940959	Because only if it's about three pages are you leveling the playing field between the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected who can hire the armies of lawyers and accountants and, yes, lobbyists to help them navigate their way through 73,000 pages.

0.0	0.442737447863	We lose on trade.
0.0	0.0388923468791	I think what President Obama did was to exemplify the importance of this issue as our first African American president, and to address it both from the President's office, and through his advocacy, such as working with young men, and Mrs. Obama's work with young women.
0.0	0.262744714324	That is what I believe.
0.0	0.0668299889823	We hear all this discussion about well, I would do this, or I would do that, when the fact is, the border is still porous.
0.0	0.153957326718	ON the other side, you have so many Republicans, and what do they care about?
0.0	0.506367655842	We have to go after terrorist networks, predominantly ISIS -- that's not the only one, but let's focus on that for a minute.

0.0	0.167204289135	We need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources, but from sources overseas, that can be a real-time fusion effort to get information where it's needed.
0.0	0.629331919354	I was recruited to H.P.

0.0	0.358207802312	I know the Democrats have the ultimate SuperPac.
0.0	0.23504591892	But, I would also add this.
0.0	0.305236723007	We have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9/11, and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks, yet we see the terrible attack in San Bernardino and know that we haven't done enough.
0.0	0.339297191671	In addition to that...

0.0	0.329400077371	That's what he talked about, the great threat of China.
0.0	0.566685330382	Those of you health savings accounts.
0.0	0.313344470773	The natural next question is who actually has done so.
0.0	0.0341917535526	I want to speak to all the moms and dads whose sons and daughters are fighting for this country, and the incredible sense of betrayal when you have a commander-in-chief who will not even speak the name of our enemy, radical Islamic terrorism, when you have a commander-in- chief who sends $150 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, who's responsible for murdering hundreds of our servicemen and women.
0.0	0.485717410885	We can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports gun control.
0.0	0.331518825251	You don't have to guess about it, because I actually have a record.
0.0	0.274670458325	We would still have sexism preventing women from getting equal pay.
0.0	0.482859201067	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.

0.0	0.699801242725	We are at 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.165637234822	I think you're --
0.0	0.360775369814	You know what he said to me?
0.0	0.200612169777	And we know of the tragic, terrible event that lead to the death of Dontre Hamilton right here in Milwaukee, a young man unarmed, who should still be with us.
0.0	0.67736740964	I would say the message that got us the win in Iowa and 10 other states against pretty overwhelming odds, is the message that's going to deliver us in this election.
0.0	0.219521578666	They don't like NBC, but I like the poll.
0.0	0.236978401523	You know why?
0.0	0.585594085106	But what happened is a political vacuum developed.
0.0	0.552090838639	Most importantly, I think I understand leadership, which sometimes requires a tough call in a tough time.
0.0	0.616301969175	Really systemic racism in this state, as in others, education, in employment, in the kinds of factors that too often lead from a position where young people, particularly young men, are pushed out of school early, are denied employment opportunities.
1.0	0.635008614228	I have vetoed a reduction this clip size.
0.0	0.0988462860192	I like Chris Christie, but we can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports Common Core.
0.0	0.0492374962862	They are more likely to know what's happening in their families and their communities, and they need to feel not just invited, but welcomed within the American society.
0.0	0.594808620752	That's why we embraced free enterprise, and it made us the most prosperous people in the history of the world.
0.0	0.437568058894	You've got to give people hope.
0.0	0.48797166282	And you combine that with a plan to make manufacturing -- this country number one in manufacturing, you've got someone who's going to help revitalize and give hope to America, the place -- the place is that is the most hopeless today.
0.0	0.160887238951	That is like shouting "fire" in a crowded theater, and that is illegal, and I would do everything in our power not just to go after those who are here who we know who are here, before they can radicalize other Americans to carry out attacks, and it's not just the ones they've arrested.
0.0	0.158033518398	So what I will tell you about our incentives -- our incentives are tight, and at the end of the day we make sure that we gain more from the creation of jobs than what we lose.
0.0	0.570373645276	We have been debating right here the core difference between conservatism and progressivism.
0.0	0.459954219043	And, Jim, you know full well that in the seven years I was U.S. attorney we went after pharmaceutical companies.

0.0	0.0879677358054	And I would not stand for that as president of the United States.
0.0	0.872330062183	You know, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took the oath of office in 1933 at a time when 25 percent of the American people were unemployed, country was in incredible despair.
0.0	0.619879706117	Last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee.
0.0	0.259690118955	And when it comes to the issues that are really on the front lines as to whether we're going to have equal pay, paid family leave, some opportunity for, you know, women to go as far as their hard work and talent take them, I think that we still have some barriers to knock down, which is why that's at the core of my campaign.
0.0	0.568199707994	They attacked us in Philadelphia last week.

0.0	0.509022018738	It is absolutely absurd to say that I had any kind of a relationship with them.
0.0	0.270611297783	So, you know, we'll take our progress wherever we can find it.
0.0	0.415810403688	In the crowd today is Major General James Livingston, who's the co-chairman of my campaign here in South Carolina, a Medal of Honor recipient.
0.0	0.251236707723	No radical Islam that is allowed to engage in encouraging violence against Americans, that is not protected speech.

0.0	0.0438260746217	And if you really want to believe that you can get your voice back, I will tell you, as I have all my career, I will continue to fight for you, because you're the ones that built this country, and will carry it into the future.
0.0	0.511930331293	It was a back sacrifice, and I have to hand it to Ben.
0.0	0.351983330851	So we have to go after this both abroad and at home.

0.0	0.346096242178	He's wrong.
0.0	0.396943212046	No, I think the idea was that president -- then-Senator Obama was wrong for suggesting that it is a good idea to talk to your opponents.
0.0	0.370421934634	We don't have procurement being done for refreshing the equipment.
0.0	0.689894669126	I like Marco too, and two years ago, he called me a conservative reformer that New Jersey needed.
0.0	0.361298167409	You can't just ban all Muslims.
0.0	0.720741072274	They will also have to pay 16 percent on the money they pay their employees.
0.0	0.0727572173159	But they need to see leadership, support and resolve from the United States of America, and we can help them defeat ISIS.
0.0	0.692659809907	Look, every time the Federal Government gets engaged in something it gets worse.

0.0	0.484393941049	Enough on fantasy football.

0.0	0.441809171583	That's where crime is happening in these cities where they don't enforce the immigration laws.
0.0	0.0842759544242	And that's why, as president, I will look at communities that need special help and try to deliver that.
0.0	0.110565873853	You want to fix Medicare?
0.0	0.27876323471	I am not a single- issue candidate, and I do not believe we live in a single-issue country.
0.0	0.853705315325	With grandiose language, the president talks about red lines and nothing to follow it up; talks about ISIS being the JV team, they form a caliphate the size of Indiana with 35 (thousand) to 40,000 battle-tested terrorists.

0.0	0.210650464059	So, yes, I do believe that when we talk about public education in America, today, in a rapidly changing world, we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities.
0.0	0.345350616245	You know the nice thing about the mainstream media, they don't hide their views.
0.0	0.15799352927	I'd say, "General, enforce the law against everyone justly, fairly, and aggressively.

1.0	0.416634654389	The government stole it, and spent it a long time ago...
0.0	0.283974264836	Think about it.
0.0	0.557989743199	That is very different than talking about specific action for regime change, which I did not support.
0.0	0.383775661929	Not everybody remembers that.
0.0	0.383909926612	On welfare.
0.0	0.191873963698	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.211384165843	Not keeping the government open.
0.0	0.13416636101	And I won't be angry when we fix it, but until we fix it, I'm very, very angry.
0.0	0.355609941739	We do.
0.0	0.376328987462	Yes, I do believe that now after the American people bailed Wall Street out, yes, they should pay a Wall Street speculation tax so that we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.0926363049879	And I was going to tell you, whether I'm president or not, we better make it clear to the Saudis that we're going to support you, we're in relation with you just like we were in the first Gulf War, but you've got to knock off the funding and teaching of radical clerics who are the very people who try to destroy us and will turn around and destroy them.
0.0	0.315361464462	You can campaign, or just resign and let someone else take the job.
0.0	0.363469072258	So what we're going to have to start doing instead of, you know, picking on this group or this group, is we're going to have to have a major reduction in the regulatory influence that is going on.
0.0	0.193775148358	We also need a nominee, a candidate who will endorse our own principles.
0.0	0.118197966781	QUICK: Governor, thank you.

0.0	0.482139871085	Well, first of all, when we talk about the Import Export Bank, it's time to clean up corporate welfare.
0.0	0.258333941636	...in the world for people...
0.0	0.521056190342	Well, I was a conservative governor of Virginia, I governed that way, and that's my track record.
0.0	0.812251665643	So the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced: a simple flat tax, 10 percent for individuals, and a 16 percent business flat tax, you abolish the IRS...
0.0	0.126363401831	This president and John Kerry and Hillary Clinton all have made it harder for the next president to act, but he must act to confront the ambitions of Iran.
0.0	0.402661672264	When you're a governor, you're held accountable for everything you do.

0.0	0.337280909324	I got the briefings.
0.0	0.39359175628	You don't solve it by big talk where you're banning all Muslims and making it harder for us to build the kind of coalition for us to be successful.
0.0	0.100659187607	This is a remarkable and horrifying fact.

0.0	0.258338635973	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.13825373476	I don't know where you...
0.0	0.0671774304925	With Saudi Arabia and oil production, first of all, it's so critical for us to be energy independent, and we're getting there because of fracking and we ought to explore because, see, energy independence gives us leverage and flexibility, and secondly, if you want to bring jobs back to the United States of America in industry, low prices make the difference.

0.0	0.184189443396	I think I'm going to win fair and square (inaudible) to win this way.
0.0	0.376181722318	We haven't.

0.0	0.715779289315	We don't represent Wall Street, we don't represent the billionaire class, so it ends up I'm the only candidate up here of the many candidates who has no Super PAC.
0.0	0.0618626498841	In fact, we need to -- wait a minute -- we need vigilance.

0.0	0.393789476934	African-Americans who face discrimination in the job market, education, housing, and the criminal justice system.
0.0	0.314143636733	It was a big insurance company, AIG.
0.0	0.217563599608	I am deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.94972801265	$19 billion of tax cuts, 1.3 million jobs created.

0.0	0.432702128635	We will work with our Sunni allies.
0.0	0.332337665705	I would change them.
0.0	0.51799253148	This is a country that is of, for and by the people.
0.0	0.249382948013	We should be deporting criminals, not hardworking immigrant families who do the very best they can and often are keeping economies going in many places in our country.
0.0	0.332809515019	You know, we could give you another example -- the Marines, the Army, these wonderful six soldiers that were killed.
0.0	0.0971662246698	So let's start -- let's start with immigration.
0.0	0.195425763155	...
0.0	0.486832392721	Reforming entitlements, cutting taxes.
0.0	0.309101232204	In fact, what that hurts is hurt hardworking taxpayers.

0.0	0.363597775839	That is a dramatic tax decrease for hard-working people who run their own businesses.

0.0	0.128503554679	I totally get that.
0.0	0.302565691653	You've got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.0888727308939	But to destroy ISIS, it is necessary.
0.0	0.167755158673	Under that theory, not only would I be disqualified, Marco Rubio would be disqualified, Bobby Jindal would be disqualified and, interestingly enough, Donald J. Trump would be disqualified.
0.0	0.231531709869	I know personally how extraordinary and unique this nation is.
0.0	0.3520819235	Let me, you know, again, respectfully disagree with Secretary Clinton here.
0.0	0.798187171384	We can save and preserve and strengthen Social Security by making no changes for seniors, but for younger workers gradually increasing the retirement age, changing the rate of growth so that it matches inflation, and critically allowing younger workers to keep a portion of our tax payments in a personal account that we own, we control them, we can pass on to our kids.
1.0	0.941881480107	It says that after 35 million people have come here over the last 20 years, almost all of whom are unskilled workers, flattening wages, creating horrible opportunity -- a lack of opportunities for unskilled workers, we're going to do something about reducing the level of immigration by 25 percent.
0.0	0.558683310318	They know that this country is not respected around the world anymore.
0.0	0.294270207759	You want to talk about what we're going to be up against next year?
0.0	0.392544391396	Socialist and government dependent.
0.0	0.263887663203	I am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of Vermont from very significant majorities of women.
0.0	0.2917065316	The time to turn the page is now.
0.0	0.234140758648	And believe me, Assad is not worth it.
0.0	0.233309264431	Since he has changed his mind on amnesty, on health care and on abortion, I would just ask, what are the principles by which he will govern?
0.0	0.138880341184	They have a responsibility, as well.
0.0	0.535316233916	And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, because I've been a leader on these issues.
0.0	0.180965086346	It's not the evil rich people.
0.0	0.76729252016	We had Iran putting operatives in South America and Central America.
0.0	0.159880814204	And -- and I guess I can -- can frame it another way.
0.0	0.53716428532	Are you concerned like I am that the debt and deficits of Washington, D.C. are endangering America's future?
0.0	0.221414014941	Well, Senator, look, I think we're in vigorous agreement here.
0.0	0.528584838954	Well, Secretary Clinton, you're not in the White House yet.
0.0	0.827253034135	We called Ben, he was with me 100%.
0.0	0.488009060335	SuperPacs are a disaster.
0.0	0.480689518557	In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense.
0.0	0.999999969968	After those four years of looking back and being prepared, the preparation to be the most powerful individual in the world requires an extraordinary amount of work: not just having been the governor of the 12th largest economy in the world, which I might add, we added 1.5 million jobs during that period of time over that 2007 through 2014 period, a period when America was going through the most deep recession it had been through since the Great Depression.
0.0	0.215938720869	I think that's a mistake.
0.0	0.268967571179	Every war you can imaging, we have people at each other's throat and our strength is actually in our unity.
0.0	0.329066870062	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.437484040426	And it is difficult to in any way argue with the goal that we both share.
0.0	0.489271484321	We're seeing it in my state and we'll see it in this country.
0.0	0.25958651176	And by the way, it's not just on immigration, you used to support TPA, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.272827942463	I'd also go after these sanctuary cities, do everything we can to make sure that we are not -- that we are actually prosecuting and cutting off funding for cities that are harboring illegal aliens, and then finally making sure the IRS is not going after conservative or religious groups.
0.0	0.493136405474	But we're not gambling.
0.0	0.4139507979	Give Bernie Sanders credit.
0.0	0.251751918467	Yes.
0.0	0.482579184396	It is broke, it is not working.
0.0	0.403052718282	(APPLAUSE) This is not a cage match.
0.0	0.339498532055	We can't do it.

0.0	0.343343515086	He doesn't meet -- here's the difference.
0.0	0.319326285926	You want to see a war on women?
0.0	0.155482991977	Let me say on that...
0.0	0.844593911895	It's the most exceptional country the world has ever known.
0.0	0.360834166219	About Medicare?
0.0	0.170428407928	I cannot tell you how much our nation is threatened and how we need a commander in chief who understands the threats to this nation.
0.0	0.235107936382	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.527167424635	My parents in this country were able to give me the chance to do all the things they never did.
0.0	0.252137821882	You know, I see a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist.
0.0	0.453659392426	And I used it to pay off my loans.
0.0	0.41658447815	The other issue is mental health.
0.0	0.537989913569	Now, I'm the only person that's put out a detailed plan on how to deal with entitlements.
0.0	0.457683058184	No, not a comic book, and it's not a very nicely asked question the way you say that.
0.0	0.117648237435	But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work.
0.0	0.289701646429	We're going to have people come in, but they're coming in legally.
0.0	0.432458082179	And the people who are often the most hard-hit are widows, because when their spouse dies, they can lose up to one-half of their Social Security monthly payment.
1.0	0.637450686149	Who denies that African-American youth unemployment, real, is over 50 percent.
0.0	0.162519112731	...The only way we're going to be morale, the only way we're going to keep our promise to seniors is start by following the first rule we should all follow, which is to look at them, treat them like adults, and tell them the truth.
0.0	0.487386040747	So many companies are going to leave our country.
0.0	0.629819729813	Can I just add one very quick thing?
0.0	0.655467828613	I voted for Dodd-Frank, got an important amendment in it.
0.0	0.682861011303	A 100, 150 years ago incredibly brave Americans said, you know what, working class kids, low income kids should not have to work in factories or on the farms.

0.0	0.612489643794	We had a decision to make early on, do we do a Super PAC?
0.0	0.170367281939	It is Hillary, it is Biden, it is the others who insist on allowing abortion well into viable (inaudible) wrong, and that should be stopped.
0.0	0.327991401738	I don't recall them calling for his resignation --
0.0	0.622786554986	I've done it once in Washington, with great jobs and lower taxes.
0.0	0.5	I will begin tomorrow to filibuster it.
0.0	0.193436837513	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.261835888197	And you can go get it at jeb2016.com.
0.0	0.458097517675	I've also called for the end of family detention, for the end of privately-run detention centers, along with private prisons, which I think are really against the common good and the rule of law.
0.0	0.532521391838	But it was not on a second filing with FDIC and yes, I made a paperwork error disclosing it on one piece of paper instead of the other.
0.0	0.276293264118	And I have many great Muslim friends.
0.0	0.5	I can only say that we both share the goal of universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.343560920703	I'm too trusting.
0.0	0.68092707544	We raised the military spending, took from entitlements, and raised domestic spending and the deficit will explode under this.
0.0	0.299167026917	My sister was a single mom, both of my aunts who were a single moms.
0.0	0.355609941739	You do.
0.0	0.0157393688943	Oh yeah, we want to elect a good president, but America is great from the bottom-up, and the bottom-up is us in our families, in our communities, in our neighborhoods.
0.0	0.251751918467	OK?
0.0	0.594094394593	Well, first of all, I'm 7 and 0 in my fantasy league.
0.0	0.234140375167	...Rand is exactly right.
0.0	0.581556913145	The men and women on this stage have more ideas, more experience, more common sense than every participant in the Democratic debate.
0.0	0.5	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, the slower the economy becomes.
0.0	0.0595895700406	And there should be some regulation.
0.0	0.429728348805	They said they would get rid of the unconstitutional amnesty.
0.0	0.709213845359	I'm the only person on this stage that actually was involved in the chief architect of balancing the Federal Budget.
0.0	0.385933419894	I don't know if people understand, but I spent a lifetime with my colleagues getting us to a federal balanced budget.
0.0	0.621783254967	We put in place child care support.
0.0	0.604810694083	Barack Obama got his massive tax increase, and there was no spending cuts.
0.0	0.270072987427	No their not.
0.0	0.306664975214	That makes the world less peaceful, less safe.
0.0	0.469108425764	I'm prepared.
0.0	0.344414319334	That is why there is massive despair all over this country.
0.0	0.698458380946	Now 16 percent is what the rate Ted wants it at.
1.0	0.801943359578	I have long supported the proposition that we should lift the cap on taxable income coming into the Social Security Trust Fund, starting at $250,000.
0.0	0.331818312214	Yes, they've got to get out of Syria.
0.0	0.5	I'm proud that I gave him that advice.
0.0	0.222348872625	Wait for what?
0.0	0.155354538506	Came out great.
0.0	0.390998242231	We need a fighter for this country again.
0.0	0.263891221694	And I said, "Didn't you resent America for not letting you be with your father in those formative and very threatening years?"
0.0	0.757297829652	And, look, I think it's important to look at what the most important counterterrorism judgment of the first four years of the Obama administration was, and that was the very difficult decision as to whether or not to advise the president to go after bin Laden.
0.0	0.199950994267	But she did say there was anger.
0.0	0.137435047591	John, do you want me to answer or do you want to answer?
0.0	0.251751918467	Yeah.
0.0	0.800302747786	The issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24 months ago.
0.0	0.33422717957	Absolutely.
0.0	0.346462621875	And he got nasty.
0.0	0.347762909371	This would be devastating for the economy.
0.0	0.542196081006	It was Countrywide Mortgage.
0.0	0.538823167413	We're a country of laws, Bill.
0.0	0.525635795834	If they had guns, he wouldn't be around very long.
0.0	0.565165458054	You know how many votes John McCain missed when he was carrying out that furious comeback that you're now modeling after?
0.0	0.602119481665	Bring the money -- the $2 trillion -- back to the United States.
0.0	0.936499257508	However, we saved 80,000 jobs and we went on to grow to 160,000 jobs, and scores of technology companies literally went out of business -- like Gateway -- taking all their jobs with them.
0.0	0.172530784077	And our adversaries continue to grow stronger.
0.0	0.433478118795	He consistently underestimates it but I do not.
0.0	0.410025781829	Senator Cruz is precisely right.
0.0	0.457294066165	It begins with tax reform.
0.0	0.371344008161	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.130822744864	And, let me now on Social Security because we were getting into a good substantive exchange, and I want to say I think both Chris, and Mike are right.
0.0	0.444184578636	In other words, the very rich are getting richer, almost everybody is going -- getting poorer.
0.0	0.251751918467	Yes.
0.0	0.485391852206	But honestly, if you're a small business owner today you are being crushed.
0.0	0.298731788762	Whether it's welfare reform and getting something back for the hard-earned taxpayers; whether it's engaging in Pentagon reform and taking on the big contractors that were charging thousands of dollars for hammers and screw drivers and ripping us off; or whether it's taking on the special interests in the nursing home industry in Ohio, so that mom and dad can have the ability to stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.
0.0	0.487665491788	You're going away for a long, long while.
0.0	0.259231022045	Come on, that's just not -- you scare senior citizens with that.
0.0	0.251751918467	Yes.
0.0	0.60582286845	Because this president has consistently underestimated the threat of ISIS.
0.0	0.252004172901	Do people not care about all of our sacrifice?
0.0	0.454032799572	They know we will be committed to victory.
0.0	0.769091130974	We cannot afford four more years of on the job training.
0.0	0.183845557804	But what happens if, God forbid, the next Barack Obama takes over, and the next Nancy Pelosi, and the next Harry Reid...
0.0	0.571018379272	Iran is sponsoring terrorism in many parts of the world, destabilizing areas.
0.0	0.710910602409	I'm not going to have something that Ted described in his tax plan.
0.0	0.436886290662	It did not come from our Judeo-Christian roots, I can tell you that.
0.0	0.513969575329	What we know is we're living longer.
0.0	0.309039258195	We need to re-establish the relationships with the Sunnis.
0.0	0.394763018825	You know why three?
1.0	0.76961151276	But we have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977.
0.0	0.706009259367	Results count, and as governor, I pushed Florida up to the top in terms of jobs, income and small business growth.
0.0	0.269066340267	Look, that's who I stand up for.
0.0	0.0974047284361	And, the only way -- no...
0.0	0.580220620442	Well, that just wasn't -- that just wasn't the fact, Senator.
0.0	0.10572137824	And it's especially significant that they are working with both Turkey and Greece in order to do this.
0.0	0.67283475266	But view is those trade policies have enabled corporate America to shut down in this country, throw millions of people out on the street.
0.0	0.113192208499	We just want to be the rich."
0.0	0.40326447596	I think the times are different now.
0.0	0.582478863529	Neil, Neil -- can I say one thing about this.
0.0	0.251391798921	It feels different.
0.0	0.63213515114	Two points.
0.0	0.277027765572	If you want someone who's not going to divide Washington, but gets things done, then you should make me your president.
0.0	0.139047440847	Well, I'll tell you something: you can take everything from the top 1 percent, and you apply it to our fiscal gap, and you won't even make a dent in it.
0.0	0.267375681307	Hillary Clinton lies about Benghazi, she lies about e- mails.
0.0	0.511189995867	We own a home four blocks away from the place that I grew up in.
0.0	0.210728134449	And as president I would expand enormous energy, literally call every member of Congress that I thought I could persuade.
0.0	0.581321941868	If she gets elected, her first 100 days, instead of setting an agenda, she might be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse.
0.0	0.27722868279	Yes, I'm going to do away with that.
0.0	0.312228059356	And, here's the difference between me and Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.422765955454	I would just say this, we've heard a lot of great ideas up here, and I agree with what Senator Rubio said.
0.0	0.413582585708	I had to borrow money to go to school.
0.0	0.486594872227	Almost 60 percent of American people now need to hire an expert to understand their taxes.
0.0	0.330200254481	He's a good guy, a smart guy, and he would be a heck of a lot better president than Hillary Rodham Clinton would ever be.
0.0	0.119679029722	So I would -- I would be willing to do that.
0.0	0.0654068827403	You know, I -- my -- my mother taught me this.
0.0	0.703838538286	He pushed through, and he passed the Dodd-Frank regulation, the toughest regulations since the 1930's.
1.0	0.591648566573	And the reason I said that is because the FBI director told the American people, told Congress, that he could not guarantee he could vet them and it would be safe.
0.0	0.320952370796	We need sound money.
0.0	0.4497052746	We have to end crony capitalism in Washington, where the lobbyists and the powerful can get tax breaks and tax credits, and the American people don't get laws in their interest.
0.0	0.308273210004	Suicide, alcoholism, drugs, that's why we need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country, and not just a handful of billionaires who have enormous economic and political power.
0.0	0.616027008705	When I'm president of the United States, we are defending the Second Amendment, not undermining it the way Barack Obama does.
0.0	0.596552952619	A lot of interesting issues have come together.
0.0	0.356880487442	John, I'll tell you something.
0.0	0.0827190530904	And then the Government steps in to try and solve the problem and we get a little further down to that progressive vision that Hillary Clinton is talking about.
0.0	0.191495954196	I believe we are on the path to doing that.
0.0	0.122193383055	Makes it a whole lot easier for them to want to go somewhere else.
0.0	0.382545974671	They're absolutely false.
0.0	0.556755290263	We had this failed red line with Assad and it discouraged folks that want to help us on the ground.
0.0	0.527831486123	I looked at the evidence.
0.0	0.748194911345	Our wages are growing faster than the national average, and I've cut taxes more than any sitting governor in this state -- $5 billion, including no taxes on small business and killing the death tax.
0.0	0.127701890427	There are other racial discrepancies.
0.0	0.745160863418	We will use those proceeds, a hundred billion a year, to invest in rebuilding our infrastructure.
0.0	0.681865836254	He appointed Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, someone who has been a radical against the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.
0.0	0.316844939	And that problem is too big regulations like the EPA, too much new taxes on business that we have seen and "Obamacare."
0.0	0.349292395801	As a matter of fact, if you're Hispanic or African-American in Texas, you have the number one high school graduation rates in America.
0.0	0.166424382529	And, the fact is, none of them.
0.0	0.168535599942	... stirs up the demagoguery against American Muslims, that hurts us at home.
0.0	0.378841170061	I'll tell you what else people are concerned about.
0.0	0.615999195246	We have talked about tax reform in every single election for decades.
0.0	0.087145389853	But, let me tell you who not to blame.
0.0	0.531399542308	It took -- it took an arm and a leg to be able to set up a 401(k).
0.0	0.5	That is not what America is supposed to be about.
0.0	0.977580189723	Number two, this was the man that was a managing general partner at Lehman Brothers when it went down the tubes and almost took every one of us with it, including Ben and myself, because I was there and I watched what happened.
0.0	0.321830831112	You really can't.
0.0	0.811627206177	I also believe that marriage is between one man and one woman.
0.0	0.171978223368	Let me tell you how that question...
1.0	0.865922469331	We do what the American people want, to expand Social Security by $1,300 a year for people under $16,000, and we extend the life of Social Security for 58 years.
0.0	0.492995343905	Their kids are having a hard time finding any work at all.
0.0	0.5	You just don't make promises like this.
0.0	0.625537803863	... you had two 110-story buildings come crashing down.
0.0	0.236978401523	You know why?
1.0	0.897116759267	I'm very proud that I support legislation that is currently in the Congress, got support of almost all progressive Democrats in the House and Senate, which says we will end the absurdity of women today making 79 cents on the dollar compared to men.
0.0	0.157533920553	So I think the better approach, the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against China economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage Barack Obama is doing to this economy.
0.0	0.240814287977	Maria, Neil, thank you for a great debate tonight.
0.0	0.435434069637	We've got a president who cannot bring himself to say the words "radical Islamic terrorism."
0.0	0.238563231424	I came as a reformer.
0.0	0.267978727088	And I just want to say, you know, last week we released our tax plan.
1.0	0.765578414596	We can't afford to have another four years like the last eight years.
0.0	0.893724053318	I was the chairman of the National Commission on Homeland Security and Terrorism for the United States for five years.
0.0	0.384405362444	So you know the New York Times and I don't have exactly have the warmest of relationships.
0.0	0.663417976681	I'm against the kind of inhumane treatment that is now being visited upon families, waking them up in the middle of the night, rounding them up.
0.0	0.425622663848	And this summer, we didn't do that.
0.0	0.208514638341	First thing I'd tell the American people, whatever it takes to defend our nation, I would do.
0.0	0.640678056714	The fact of the matter is he doesn't realize that we now live in the 21st century, and that war is very different than it used to be before.
0.0	0.478524226441	And the reasons why I've done is I don't believe we have a good process of being able to vet them.
0.0	0.145931189487	I want a government so small that the individual has a chance to thrive and prosper.
0.0	0.143013401665	No, it's true.
0.0	0.360535299682	It is a complicated relationship.
0.0	0.445547293464	We have to provide the NATO support to back up the mission that is going on.
0.0	0.33840984251	I mean, let me be honest with the people who are watching at home.
0.0	0.48980898294	But we're running for the presidency of the United States here.
0.0	0.0755048741635	And, we come out here, and we do our thing.
0.0	0.400804917691	Here is where we are with public education.
0.0	0.3642305565	I'm not anti-Wall Street, but I don't believe the government ought to wear a team jersey, pick winners and losers.
0.0	0.125365297463	She wants to continue down the path of Iran, Benghazi, the Russian reset, Dodd-Frank, all the things that have -- that have gone wrong in this country, she would be a national security mess.
1.0	0.885576518097	Workforce participation rates lower than they were in 1977.
0.0	0.655089632017	It was 25 years ago, and I came by defeating the Democratic incumbent.
0.0	0.855649621852	Well, first of all, we're running a $2 billion dollar surplus, we're not having a revenue problem right now.
0.0	0.555357128542	Well, we've gotta turn the economy around for people who are struggling.
0.0	0.511726465272	Government causes a problem, and then government steps in to solve the problem.
0.0	0.715578990739	And I traveled the country and learned how people made jobs.
0.0	0.557042450234	It's now half the size of what it was prior to Operation Desert Storm.
0.0	0.308128338801	No.
0.0	0.537631946123	This isn't the governments money.
0.0	0.251751918467	Okay.
0.0	0.251764788673	(LAUGHTER) And he got nasty.
0.0	0.99629923536	And not only did I win, but I then worked with a Democratic legislature to put in place the most sweeping conservative reforms of any state in America, taking us from the most dangerous state in America to the fourth safest; reducing our welfare rolls by over 1 million, and replacing over 700,000 private sector jobs.
0.0	0.292953331148	We have a country of borders.
0.0	0.00894469203968	I would like to take a hard look at every part of the federal government and really do the kind of analysis that would rebuild some confidence in people that we're taking a hard look about what we have, you know, and what we don't need anymore.
0.0	0.643606693712	I will tell you, you could win a bet at a bar tonight, since we're talking about fantasy football, if you ask who the top three states in America are that produce solar energy: California and Arizona are easy, but number three is New Jersey.
0.0	0.417993209494	Here's the thing that I would ask Donald Trump in all seriousness.
0.0	0.344297760292	Whatever it takes, as long as it takes, to defeat them.
0.0	0.155899392924	But the key thing that we're seeing now is serious challenges to this country that must change, the direction of this nation must change.
0.0	0.274004806976	You know, back in September, my friend Donald said that he had had his lawyers look at this from every which way, and there was no issue there.
0.0	0.883763005578	And I'll tell you why, last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee, she admitted she had sent emails to her family saying, hey, this attack in Benghazi was caused by al Qaeda-like elements.
0.0	0.171573945693	We need to have stronger families.
0.0	0.690919846618	Let me just add one thing about ISIS over there.
0.0	0.408743796198	And when the president of the United States gets out to speak about it, does he support police officers?
0.0	0.446102948008	We need to be on the side that keeps Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.42367464179	When I'm president of the United States we are getting rid of Obamacare and we are rebuilding our military.
0.0	0.117322935429	The fact that it's happened for so many people here throughout our history, that's what makes us special.
0.0	0.680098965612	There is one major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people.
0.0	0.139317101963	I mean, you have great constitutional lawyers that say you can't run.
0.0	0.143738495155	We would still have LGBT people who get married on Saturday and get fired on Monday.
0.0	0.157957435846	Let me tell you, everybody, when they say they want to give it to you for free, keep your hands on your wallets because they're coming to you to pay for it.
0.0	0.376062732229	I think that's a major accomplishment.
0.0	0.663831768602	Because seniors, if they are retired, are no longer earning an income from a job.
0.0	0.486603196987	It was the AFL-CIO.
0.0	0.867890813743	Well, they're the ones not listening to the scientists today, because doctors say that at 20 weeks that is a viable life inside the womb.
0.0	0.124979879398	I would hold a Camp David summit with our Arab allies, not to talk them into this lousy deal with Iran, but to say to them, "what is it that you need to defeat ISIL?"
0.0	0.157286875714	Well, I would really appreciate that.
0.0	0.335514801648	We're on the verge of being the first generation of Americans that leave our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.41914725234	Well, I wish you would have asked that question years ago when they broke it.
0.0	0.462997772313	This is a group of people that enslaves women and sells them, sells them as brides.
0.0	0.867379822682	Now, I find it rather amazing, because I happen to believe that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country.
0.0	0.624826737617	Government trying to level the playing field between Internet and brick-and-mortar creates a problem.
0.0	0.205244062912	They have infrastructure.
0.0	0.768663245053	I've had the growth code (ph) there for about five years, and it's this specific program.
0.0	0.449708453644	Take it to the bank.
0.0	0.14567681286	And I say, look, it's not Republicans' fault, it's not Democrats' fault, it's your grandparents' fault for having too many damn kids.
0.0	0.273707651988	Do you think that the Chinese, if they had a 45 percent tariff imposed on all their imports wouldn't retaliate and start buying Airbus?
1.0	0.422860897058	It isn't there anymore, Mike.
0.0	0.407790563294	I'm worried about bankrupting the American people.
0.0	0.414409776645	And Lehman Brothers started it all.
1.0	0.818481613028	All that's in that trust fund is a pile of IOUs for money they spent on something else a long time ago.
0.0	0.757735916709	I don't know if any of us could have done what they did, one after another, within 48 hours of that tragedy taking place.
0.0	0.190148968797	We don't need to add new rules, we need to make sure the FBI does its job.
0.0	0.16377344386	I think maybe my greatest weakness is that I trust people too much.
1.0	0.5	We had a $1.4 trillion deficit.
0.0	0.41352733053	Gronkowski is still going strong.
0.0	0.115531877224	And they wonder whether somebody is getting something to -- keeping them from getting it.
0.0	0.234553384196	Well, let me tell you this.
0.0	0.886310523733	Fred Thompson was the other one, a man who had spent a lot of time on that screen.
0.0	0.311869775276	There are a lot of people living paycheck to paycheck in Florida as well, they're looking for a senator that will fight for them each and every day.
0.0	0.322666136968	The reason that I -- I hate them so much is because every single regulation costs in terms of goods and services.
0.0	0.215488084757	I don't care.
0.0	0.678057017533	So we have no disagreement about the need to buttress Social Security, get more revenue into the program.
0.0	0.535571437935	A Republican Congress did that.
0.0	0.164373955884	You know, America doesn't owe me anything.
0.0	0.104545862874	We need to take a new approach of taxing -- reforming how we tax, and reforming the regulations in our -- in our country before it's too late.
0.0	0.417160060465	And, it was made for we the people, we are the ones who decide who we are, and we should never give away the values and principles that made America into a great nation for the sake of political correctness.
0.0	0.343710764114	We don't win.
0.0	0.266311125513	You can't send your troops into harm's way unless you give them every opportunity to be successful.
0.0	0.221039468563	That we do all that we can to create a world of peace and prosperity.
0.0	0.37139256597	I lead the opposition against it.
0.0	0.247297270644	But the facts and the law here are really quite clear.
0.0	0.780720513702	... that after the 9/11 attacks, Secretary Rumsfeld invited me to the Pentagon with a meeting of the former secretaries of Defense.
0.0	0.215202853973	The answer is simple.
0.0	0.136662599063	But look...
0.0	0.118339880742	Americans are tired of hearing this debate -- want to go to, what are you going to do about illegal immigration?
0.0	0.426275420102	They go to Harvard.
0.0	0.681454137084	And it's the most regressive tax there is.
0.0	0.459180628223	We would still have racism holding people back.
0.0	0.604200373837	Well, this goes to the question you were just asking.
0.0	0.856361667684	The first speech I gave in this campaign back in April was about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration.
0.0	0.518430755727	So I'm going to keep making that case.
0.0	0.424352748375	And, sending mixed signals to kids about drugs is a disaster.
0.0	0.214731408035	And when we talk about Wall Street, let's talk about Wall Street.
0.0	0.11374786634	I'm running for president to knock down all the barriers that are holding Americans back, and to rebuild the ladders of opportunity that will give every American a chance to advance, especially those who have been left out and left behind.
0.0	0.646463397633	Well, if that's the case, we're going to win every state, if Bernie Sanders is the nominee.
0.0	0.445186648574	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.212361234521	Because that's what we'd get if it were Jeb -- I tell you what, we don't need that.
0.0	0.477370189162	We do not have to have massive levels of income and wealth inequality.
0.0	0.350163894013	I love China.
0.0	0.402546596354	Marco Rubio, why don't you resign?
0.0	0.256342299654	I'd consider it.
0.0	0.232155978537	But, here is the truth.
0.0	0.567826495745	You know, I have said -- I have said many times, you know, I'm not asking people to support me because I'm a woman.
0.0	0.647374874323	You think about it -- this is the president who said, along with his secretary of state -- drew a red line in Syria, said, if Assad uses chemical weapons against his people, that we're going to attack.
0.0	0.304087528705	But the voters are savvier than that.
0.0	0.41506042225	Of course you are right.
1.0	0.430884909962	And Iranian wise guys having guns to their heads.
0.0	0.580983190627	I was governor on September 11th, and I'm proud of my leadership in bringing New York through that time.
0.0	0.311443215324	But, we can't rest.
0.0	0.133271384076	How can we beat an enemy if our commander-in-chief doesn't have the moral honesty and clarity to say that Islam has a problem, and that problem is radical Islam, to say they've got to condemn not generic acts of violence, but the individual murderers who are committing these acts of violence.
0.0	0.291957322231	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.330474010585	That's not right.
0.0	0.228069634734	I'm never going to change my tune.
0.0	0.318080914435	So listen, this is the difference between being a governor and a senator.
0.0	0.370133226153	But the greatest gains, percentage-wise, for people, are gonna be at the lower end of our plan, and here's why: because in addition to a general personal exemption, we are increasing the per-child tax credit for working families.
0.0	0.691090574097	This president has gone to Congress and said give me a three-year deadline, give me a ban on ground troops.
0.0	0.567620143515	So it wasn't just me who opposed it.
0.0	0.258172074553	And the Obama-Clinton economy has left behind the working men and women of this country.
0.0	0.189174754208	Last I heard, a United States senator had the right to disagree with the president, including a president who has done such an extraordinary job.
0.0	0.881603149987	If you look at a single mom buying groceries, she sees hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent.
0.0	0.235107936382	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.334819692485	I win.
0.0	0.105294729408	We are not the world's policeman, but we need to stand up and be ready.
0.0	0.719847725669	When I was 21, my mom died.
0.0	0.142665582784	And wherever you are sitting Nikki, I'm a friend.
0.0	0.176962309697	We need to embed with -- with the Iraqi military.
0.0	0.54267103851	And that's why I've offered a specific program to the people of America tonight to address the fundamental problem of getting our country growing again, getting our economy growing, wages up, opportunities for people.
1.0	0.905584804205	Twenty-nine million people have no health insurance today in America.
0.0	0.079610255526	You see, because if you really want to get to a balanced budget, you need to reduce your expenses and you need to grow your economy.
0.0	0.317639363404	The fact is, in order to get this economy moving again, I call for freezing regulations for a year except for the problem of public safety.
0.0	0.51039129611	And every single income decile sees a double-digit increase in after-tax income.
0.0	0.375062572924	I want to tackle those barriers that stand in the way of too many Americans right now.
0.0	0.860262642901	I tried (ph), early in my marriage, explaining to my wife why someone named Sallie Mae was taking $1,000 out of our bank account every month.
0.0	0.536029647916	I am a 2nd amendment person.
0.0	0.989537383883	I started the Gang of Seven, and it led to the overtaking of the 40-year Democratic rule of Congress, because I didn't -- I stood up to the old-boy network in Washington, D.C. because I believed that Washington was not the solution, that Washington was the problem, just like Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.543716812473	When extraordinarily wealthy people make very large contributions to Super PACs, and in many cases in this campaign, Super PACs have raised more money than individual candidates have, OK?
0.0	0.489591893133	At that particular point in time, then Americans will believe that Washington is up to a conversation to deal with the millions of people that are here illegally, but not until.
0.0	0.628373328413	We are borrowing money from China today.
0.0	0.171044591236	Why aren't we talking about -- instead of cutting benefits for old people, cutting benefits for sick people -- why don't we say, "let's cure the four big cost-driving diseases...
0.0	0.400173257517	How about talking about the substantive issues the people care about?
0.0	0.372527940091	Everybody just needs to get used to it.
1.0	0.71108408729	Secondly, I never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.467489451679	Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns.
0.0	0.444195536531	So when Nikki said that, I wasn't offended.
0.0	0.0957385916092	Yes, does Wall Street and big financial interests, along with drug companies, insurance companies, big oil, all of it, have too much influence?
0.0	0.299439120602	Don't vote for me if you want to keep the gridlock in Washington, D.C.
1.0	0.76918751639	He voted in favor of regime change with Libya, voted in favor of the Security Council being an active participate in setting the parameters for what we would do, which of course we followed through on.
0.0	0.90076356249	And that is that one of the things you're watching tonight are 11 quality candidates debating an important issue.
0.0	0.458596902468	They don't provide any abortions in Louisiana.
0.0	0.638374195207	Because we can't just save the American Dream, we can expand it to reach more people, and change more lives than ever before.
0.0	0.124805569606	I will continue to have tremendous admiration and respect for Governor Bush.
0.0	0.104944886448	And with your vote and your support and your prayers, I will lead with the citizens of this great nation the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.572529966294	We're going to lose Social Security and Medicare if Republicans and Democrats do not come together and find a solution like Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.561844642268	Everyone up here tonight that's talking about reforms, I think and I know for myself I speak to this, we're all talking about reforms for future generations.
0.0	0.335566005903	We have to shut down their internet capability.
0.0	0.20002316954	We need to reform Social Security.
0.0	0.247199646953	I have fully endorsed those.
0.0	0.493696673199	And so everybody needs to discount some of the things you're going to hear in these ads, and discount the -- the back-and-forth here, because every person here is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.674286953147	So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States.
0.0	0.251996735193	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.494725558318	Why didn't they call the police?
1.0	0.447159984548	This president is undermining our military.
0.0	0.178200031031	I'm very angry because our country is being run horribly and I will gladly accept the mantle of anger.
0.0	0.269481258294	That the Ayatollah is a radical jihadist who really means it when he chants, "Death to America, death to Israel."
0.0	0.793939837696	My mom who's here today, was a single mom when my father left us when I was 3 years old.
0.0	0.682174098483	And -- and I would note indeed, the reason I said that is I was asked -- my friend Donald has taken to it as (ph) advance playing Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the USA", and I was asked what I thought of that.
0.0	0.203630675891	And why?
0.0	0.387040259578	Well, that's a real question.
0.0	0.225744235864	We need to rebuild our families.
0.0	0.485719589767	To repeal these unconstitutional illegal orders, whether it's amnesty or whether it's this president going around the Congress, whether it's in Obamacare, to restore the rule of law.
0.0	0.292492472998	And we're going to just fix everything with waste, fraud, and abuse?
0.0	0.33422717957	Right.
0.0	0.265978125657	I'd like to jump in.
0.0	0.259006980165	Let me say, I read that editorial today with a great amusement.
1.0	0.836348654073	You used to support a 500 percent increase in the number of guest workers, now you say that you're against it.
0.0	0.29955284641	Yes, it's very simple.
0.0	0.230284741259	You've got to keep asking because this is a hugely important issue.
0.0	0.207224708743	So look, in foreign policy -- in foreign policy, it's strength, but you've got to be cool.
0.0	0.597753102971	That's the end of the conversation.
0.0	0.310969320633	Because that person should not have gotten a gun, should not -- would not have passed a background check.
0.0	0.454464567241	Without China, North Korea doesn't even eat.
0.0	0.131304877343	It is a constitutional right of every American to be able to protect themselves and their families.
0.0	0.488657325167	I ask for your support to build, together, a safer and stronger America.
0.0	0.39786945568	If you'll answer the (inaudible) core question.
0.0	0.161865194119	The terrible, authoritarian, Communist dictatorship he warned us about, now he's urging companies to shut down and move to China.
0.0	0.460345504185	I didn't.
0.0	0.601318323542	This isn't just the country I was born in, this is the nation that literally changed the history of my family.
0.0	0.301461397298	And we got to look at the big picture here.
0.0	0.110593671342	And I'm not blaming these folks -- but I guess I could.
0.0	0.305363298543	I voted yes to suspend that.
0.0	0.376417427188	Yeah, I would go, first of all, one step further in this description of Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.230623498055	Maria...
0.0	0.0991111983551	And some of them, I will say, not all, have called me and said, "Donald, thank you very much; you're exposing an unbelievable problem and we have to get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.801013270211	We even had warnings about the Boston Marathon bombers, and yet the dots weren't connected.
0.0	0.816885371874	All the way back to when Ronald Reagan signed a piece of legislation that basically allowed for amnesty for over 4 million people, and the border is still not secure.
0.0	0.304803130444	A politician other than the people in the states -- I don't want to -- a politician cannot get them to pay.
0.0	0.28739193709	I think, actually, people are looking for that in Washington now.
0.0	0.508421307315	We pay federal taxes.
0.0	0.407042100335	So I'm doing great.
0.0	0.545722905259	... first of all, let me just tell you something -- and you know, because you just saw the numbers yourself -- NBC Wall Street Journal just came out with a poll -- headline: Trump way up, Cruz going down.
0.0	0.592126644159	But for that Texas police officer, we could have had a mass murder.
0.0	0.170947604742	We should use the debt ceiling, as precisely to Don, to force upon them budgetary reforms.
0.0	0.682785726822	I cut the bureaucracy down to size, re-introduced accountability, focused on service, on innovation, on leading in every market, in every product segment.
0.0	0.313504342739	I will tell you that.
0.0	0.256574568441	That sounds like a long time ago.
0.0	0.511156598449	That's how you go from secretary to CEO.
0.0	0.361902553981	The fact is, there is a big overhang.
0.0	0.31858269379	He doesn't want to get people together, the old-fashioned way, where you get Congress.
0.0	0.296672192021	I didn't find it offensive at all.
0.0	0.29510553495	Can we stop?
0.0	0.148551716457	We're gutting our military, and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were.
0.0	0.292401498621	And so Senator Graham is right about this.
0.0	0.691373239667	We have work to do, and we now know a lot more than we ever did before.
0.0	0.278051528155	I may not be your dream candidate just yet, but I can assure you I am Hillary Clinton's worst nightmare.
0.0	0.215179590795	I frankly don't think there will be much change because I think what's going to happen is you're going to get more of the same.
0.0	0.78528220796	Absolutely, because what we will do is say, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so they're not hanging out on street corners.
0.0	0.667564308932	That is principally an American-led air campaign that we are now engaged in.
0.0	0.31490737327	And by the way, I hope we can end the trade embargo with Cuba as well.
0.0	0.222015577315	And I was proud to stand with him and support it.
0.0	0.156905538167	Do you remember that, everybody?
0.0	0.238540561965	We got rid of Gadhafi.
0.0	0.252165980953	Not my kind of guy.
0.0	0.822300183616	I didn't get a phone call from Bill Clinton before I jumped in the race.
0.0	0.510016504239	The result of that, you had the Iranian Revolution coming in, and that is where we are today.
0.0	0.0906829515015	But I think there has to be recognition that if we -- if we are too punitive, then you'll go to other -- other technology companies outside the United States.
0.0	0.34277863603	Donald Trump actually seized on it when he talked about immigration.
0.0	0.5	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.259248110362	Oh, well, you know, it just didn't work out for you.
0.0	0.355203736218	We need to incent private savings and make sure that Social Security is protected for those that have it.
1.0	0.864419815445	Someone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander in chief and someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi can never be president of the United States.
0.0	0.32232706246	They're looking -- they're looking to manipulate our -- the visa waiver countries to get people into the United States.
0.0	0.304507628933	And kind of -- that's what I see our campaign is about right now.
0.0	0.366135321982	Let's talk about something that happened this week in the news.
0.0	0.49498570161	If I have a weakness, it's that I try to live by the rules.
0.0	0.708905466861	I'm putting up 100 percent of my own money.
0.0	0.339717207207	We have a president of the United States that is undermining this country's security and expanding the role of...
0.0	0.261311994685	And women have been disadvantaged ever since.
0.0	0.38599477101	I recommended that the president go forward.
0.0	0.950640518409	Until we have a president of the United States that gets up every day and goes to the Oval Office with the intent purpose of securing that border, and there's not anybody on either one of these stages that has the experience of dealing with this as I have for over 14 years with that 1200-mile border.
0.0	0.719688518684	I'm running for president because there is no way we can elect Hillary Clinton to continue the policies of Barack Obama.
1.0	0.690248755827	Becky, it is the height of hypocrisy for Mrs. Clinton to talk about being the first woman President, when every single policy she espouses, and every single policy of President Obama has been demonstrably bad for women.
0.0	0.274020640551	So, we are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we have to root out in our society.
0.0	0.449422880589	That is not protected free speech.
0.0	0.556170594714	We now have a 73,000-page tax code.
0.0	0.650482410886	Well, listen, I've spent my entire life defending the Constitution before the U.S. Supreme Court.
0.0	0.623243116442	America was worth the wait.
0.0	0.0473596042685	And when you do that, when you're in a position of managing regulations; when you reduce taxes; and when you have fiscal discipline, you see the job creators begin to get very comfortable with the fact that they can invest.
0.0	0.0961007579536	You know, you look at what's going on, you see all the divisiveness and the hatred that goes on in our society.
0.0	0.290603154762	We need to stop that.
0.0	0.397862308353	That's what I've done in Louisiana, that's what I'll do in America.
0.0	0.5727762639	She'd be a great president of the United States because the leadership she brought to H.P.
0.0	0.369773480031	We're friends.
0.0	0.182840162541	Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.
0.0	0.565890642	I was not that candidate.
0.0	0.032263233591	Our friends no longer think we have their back and our enemies no longer fear us, and we're in a much difficult -- we're in a much different position than we should be.
0.0	0.279878688092	There are a lot of training programs and education programs that I think can be streamlined and put into a much better format so that if we do continue them they can be more useful, in public schools, community colleges, and colleges and universities.
0.0	0.401968671545	Here's the way you need to deal with it.
0.0	0.393842839053	And it was with us for months, the smell, the air.
0.0	0.468501728958	Professional politician that can't be trusted.
0.0	0.328383717145	A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to go on a congressional delegation.
0.0	0.127586257984	And what I have concluded is that the best policy is to get rid of all government subsidies, and get the government out of our lives, and let people rise and fall based on how good they are.
0.0	0.223174176832	We don't need that.
0.0	0.103223734343	And so he undermines the Constitution, and he undermines free enterprise by expanding government, and he betrays our allies and cuts deals with our enemies and guts our military.
0.0	0.5	When people go to vote in primaries or caucuses, they are voting not only for the president, they are voting for the commander-in- chief.
0.0	0.383469542041	And I will go back to Washington with my plan.
0.0	0.35936813115	What this campaign is about is creating a process for a political revolution in which millions of Americans, working people who have given up on the political process, they don't think anybody hears their pains or their concerns.
0.0	0.513537614944	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.424858161547	Marco leaves the IRS code in with all of the complexity.
0.0	0.159782600266	... the best results, wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.597162095647	Where did that spirit come from in America?
0.0	0.130075112568	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.196252661265	Wait a minute, who in their 16th month?
0.0	0.167264778587	And, when I hear people talking about means testing, let's just remember what that means.
1.0	0.758049194831	We're spending $80 billion a year locking up fellow Americans.
0.0	0.867512855352	We're going to combine all commercial activity in business into one place in the tax code and charge it 15 percent, which is going to suddenly make us competitive with the rest of the world.
0.0	0.688488458897	And I'll tell you one thing that we never talk about -- we haven't talked about it tonight.
0.0	0.345485008607	We can get back in the game to restore order and security for our own country.
0.0	0.158912678112	And if we want to try to rebuild the coalition, as Governor Kasich was saying before, then what we better do is to get to the Arab countries that believe that ISIS is a threat, not only to them, but to us and to world peace, and bring them together.
0.0	0.031887314347	I think we need to be very careful with tariffs, and here's why.
0.0	0.107263984665	A healthy environment, a strong economy and energy independent America -- that would be the purpose of my presidency, is break the strangle hold that people enjoy on fossil fuels who hate our guts.
0.0	0.814125701567	Drugs is one of the greatest scourge in this country, and I spent five years of my administration working with my team to do a whole sort of things to try to reign in the problem of overdoses, and it goes on and on.
0.0	0.623024615525	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.532211099043	And yet the man who led my firing, Tom Perkins, an icon of Silicon Valley, has come out publicly and said, "you know what?
0.0	0.628627270522	China doesn't pay the tariff, the buyer pays the tariff.
0.0	0.772592885039	And Senator Sanders's plan really rests on making sure that governors like Scott Walker contribute $23 billion on the first day to make college free.
0.0	0.674375801045	It was an investment bank, Lehman Brothers, that contributed to our collapse.
0.0	0.282704204737	Thank you.
0.0	0.279546913036	You count on it.
0.0	0.225418930477	If that's not hypocrisy, I don't know what hypocrisy is.
0.0	0.431983926253	We're going to cut Social Security to help you.
0.0	0.231313116551	Why weren't they vigilant?
0.0	0.117586910163	And if I am elected president, to every soldier and sailor and airman and marine, and to every police officer and firefighter and first responder who risk their lives to keep us safe, I will have your back.
0.0	0.263317465988	We can't do this unilaterally.
0.0	0.392273359435	-- at least half of the things Marco said are flat-out false.
1.0	0.0993430020754	You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don't agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements.
0.0	0.725694722112	Any connection to the fact that not one Republican candidate for president thinks and agrees with the scientific community that climate change is real and that we have got to transform our energy system?
0.0	0.576195061909	We eliminate the payroll tax, we eliminate the Obamacare taxes.
0.0	0.561127690535	I will not take advice from Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.096973891411	We have the Russians and the Iranians working together, not to fight ISIS, but to prop up Assad.
0.0	0.201557006968	Run the company kids, have a good time.
0.0	0.28863426632	... believe me the world is peanuts by comparison.
0.0	0.658662595943	Did any of you get a phone call from Bill Clinton?
0.0	0.342966170369	If we means test Social Security, it means that the government decides whether or not I deserve it.
0.0	0.483506989735	But you haven't asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought I'd get that off my chest if you don't mind.
0.0	0.840028963417	But when we talk about Wall Street, you have Wall Street and major banks have paid $200 billion in fines since the great crash.
0.0	0.346044585924	That's what they're doing.
0.0	0.414706587363	They're sick of politics as usual.
0.0	0.610965624411	And in terms of seniors, there are millions of seniors -- and I've talked to them in my state of Vermont and all over this country -- who are trying to get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year Social Security.
0.0	0.0517505764782	I want to use that same up here, whatever it may be to make America rich again and to make America great again.
0.0	0.493762675046	And in your heart of hearts, you cannot wait to see a debate between Hillary Clinton and Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.0990678382826	She is still defending Planned Parenthood, and she is still her party's frontrunner.
0.0	0.574313639849	Our job has to be to recognize the conflict between the two.
0.0	0.0350064307318	And, for those of us who are serious enough to run for president, think long and hard why we're here, and hopefully you'll know we're not here for ourselves.
0.0	0.139021357255	And you had better get rid of them, because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.5	And first of all, we've got to recognize that there is problem that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have caused.
0.0	0.580430114005	And, you know the old inscription, if you save one life, you've changed the world.
0.0	0.408760974191	I know that we are at greater risk today than at any time since then of another attack.
0.0	0.111049685973	That's my view.
0.0	0.257959241994	Now, on to your substantive question.
0.0	0.94851900824	And now after seven years of your policies, we have the biggest majority we've had since the 1920s in the House; a Republican majority in the Senate; and 31 out of 50 Republican governors.
0.0	0.206620361779	I think that would have been right, as well.
0.0	0.150468915052	And I think the focus ought to be on making sure that we leave this nomination process, as wild and woolly as it's going to be -- this is not being bad.
0.0	0.250172972253	Why in God's name does Wall Street...
0.0	0.367869450607	They are trying to attack us here in America.
0.0	0.613864555169	I believe in the PTT because it's important those countries in Asia are interfacing against China.
0.0	0.672487522192	And God only knows Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator.
0.0	0.35715112214	There's no way he launches 11 attack --
0.0	0.600728119541	And I'm going to do everything I can to address distressed communities, whether they are communities of color, whether they are white communities, whether they are in any part of our country.
0.0	0.21388770943	But what he's touching -- talking about, I think has got merit.
0.0	0.314688151315	And I have a road map and a plan right now to get us to balance.
0.0	0.0948001460582	In all due respect...
0.0	0.539879750188	But as Bill said earlier, Roe v. Wade, it's has been the law for 42 years, and I don't think we should continue to try to change it.
0.0	0.34496126532	That is who I'm fighting for.
0.0	0.613492417991	Keeping the government open and continuing to borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.144267801139	I want to get ahead of those, and that's why I've proposed a much more comprehensive approach to deal with all of these...
0.0	0.558230706524	So, we're going to enforce the law, we're going to change policing practices, we're going to change incarceration practices, but we're also going to emphasize education, jobs, and housing.
0.0	0.316862403023	But we have a serious problem.
0.0	0.117200902245	The business flat tax, they already impose their taxes on us, so there's no reciprocal...
0.0	0.213174895022	Well, this is what I would say.
0.0	0.117231730094	Number -- and that is important for you to know.
0.0	0.4092710197	And you put me on that stage against her next September, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.302733814582	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.282704204737	Thank you.
0.0	0.452376902675	He's been a good governor, and he's a heck of a lot better than his predecessor that would have bankrupted New Jersey.
0.0	0.146067599892	They're not my ideas, and I don't necessarily agree with all of them.
0.0	0.714776204466	The main problem with Medicare right now is that the average person pays in taxes over their whole lifetime about $100,000.
0.0	0.288950816075	We will arm and train the Kurds.
0.0	0.51229251466	We have to stop the money flow.
0.0	0.312558076828	And if I misrepresented those results or those projections in any way, I was held criminally liable.
0.0	0.573701829292	The government has lied to you and they have stolen from you.
0.0	0.349994759637	I'm deadly serious about doing this job the right way.
0.0	0.13127417522	I think what we need is a commander in chief who is focused like a laser on keeping this country safe and on defeating radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.176923030929	We have to shut down, whether or not they're in prisons preaching or on -- in mosques preaching.
0.0	0.565493121979	On the issue of Barack Obama, Barack Obama does not believe that America is a great global power.
0.0	0.00714630462061	... president of the United States has got to do, and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility, is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe.
0.0	0.33422717957	Ever.
0.0	0.306248924148	I know a lot of Americans are angry about the economy.
0.0	0.140620778482	For the people who say we can't do it, I say hell no, we can do it together.
0.0	0.126639144301	I want to take care of women.
0.0	0.40266067145	When he meets with the attorney general in the White House, it's not "how can we protect the Second Amendment rights of Americans."
0.0	0.377531263883	Here's the bottom line, and I'll close with this.
0.0	0.43904398227	The second will be to the supreme leader of Iran.
0.0	0.5	But I promise you, in the state of South Carolina, they do.
0.0	0.211966804878	The people aren't dumb.
0.0	0.107214818429	You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president...
0.0	0.146504315365	Because of all the federal mandates and federal laws, it was too expensive.
0.0	0.148572199783	If people are promising they're going to take on Washington and cronyism, you need to look to who has been doing it.
0.0	0.796668069704	I've got one more question for you then.
0.0	0.217300733274	The American people are never going to trust Washington, D.C., and for good reason.

0.0	0.78837838448	I have the experience as a prosecutor, attorney general, governor, United States Army intelligence veteran, governor during the 9/11 attack, chairman of the Terrorism Commission for this country.
1.0	0.941440020023	I think under President Obama we have seen a lot of advances, the Affordable Care Act has helped more African Americans than any other group to get insurance, to be taken care of, but we also know a lot more than we did.
0.0	0.249982800152	And that's why we must make sure we continue to frack.
0.0	0.394968692386	That's an interesting question.
0.0	0.566910336059	This issue now has to be about stopping ISIS entering the United States, and when I'm president we will.
0.0	0.509559279881	Unintended consequences.
0.0	0.469319031679	But if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in Flint.
0.0	0.316166052571	You can have him.
0.0	0.413647358719	And this president turns his back -- this president doesn't enforce the marijuana laws in this country because he doesn't agree with them.
0.0	0.0463716860486	I would hope that you would come onboard and say that this is the simple and straightforward thing to do.
0.0	0.308501622398	Wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.155051227722	But mostly, the highest calling of leadership is to challenge the status-quo and unlock the potential of others.
0.0	0.0750351202598	And we got to fight like crazy so people can think the American dream still exists, because it does, with rising wages, with full employment and with everybody in America -- and I mean everybody in America -- having an opportunity to realize the American dream of having a better life than their mother and their father.
0.0	0.376114656184	Now Maria, listen.
0.0	0.206991752267	What we have to start thinking about, as leaders, particularly in government, is what can we do for the average American?
0.0	0.401379678613	Target the efforts for people that are committing crimes with guns, and if you do that, and get it right, you're going to be much better off than creating a political argument where there's a big divide.
0.0	0.345822153869	He doesn't understand the threat in ISIS.
0.0	0.422145278213	He was such a nice guy.
0.0	0.0342549373772	I've lived my whole life fighting -- fighting for things that I believe in, fighting for justice and to protect people from crime and terrorism, fighting to stand up for folks who have not had enough and need an opportunity to get more, and to stand up and fight against the special interests.
0.0	0.234978533919	We're going to be tough at the border, we're going to be tough on all of the illegal immigrants that everybody else in this field -- we're going to be different.
0.0	0.423083341964	I do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination to succeed President Obama.
0.0	0.523572492116	Yes, I believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on Wall Street, that they are a Wall Street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession -- Great Depression.
0.0	0.411005908623	It's the people that pull the trigger and we have to find out what is going on.
0.0	0.617066905273	And you know, when you see Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and all the Democrats talking about wanting to address the plight of working women, not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama, 3.7 million women have entered poverty.
0.0	0.178661792091	It ain't going to happen.
0.0	0.390030966936	We actually did it.
0.0	0.882578782423	In that State of the Union, President Obama didn't so much as mention the 10 sailors that had been captured by Iran.
0.0	0.493200581368	Bernie Sanders, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.
0.0	0.35359187511	I think we need to do a lot more than we're doing.
0.0	0.462245413373	At the end of the day, ladies and gentlemen, our best days are ahead of us only if we work together, and I intend to put this country on a path of success by working together and doing the hard things that should have been done a very long time ago.
0.0	0.230623498055	Becky --
0.0	0.379141468593	It has to be based on what skills you have, what you can contribute economically, and most important of all, on whether or not you're coming here to become an American, not just live in America, but be an American.
0.0	0.15540371221	That is absolutely not right.
0.0	0.480667484588	We should be relying upon the leadership of the Congress to pass the laws.
0.0	0.0941354884851	Also, when you look at these videos, they are horrific and show just a hideous disrespect for life.
0.0	0.560726501839	You'll see me on the floor of the Senate tomorrow filibustering this and saying enough is enough, no more debt.
0.0	0.39722044534	You know, the Russians wanted to buy time.
0.0	0.390784394329	The second point, it does not eliminate the corporate tax or the payroll tax.
0.0	0.745026683359	If you are now hit on a 60 percent tax on both your income and on the wages you pay your employees, where are you going to get that money from?
0.0	0.407721019726	And, they're always going to say, "Well, we're going to fix this one day."
0.0	0.279297192523	This is the first priority.
0.0	0.394224923204	I'm ready.
0.0	0.431648020113	You know, Hillary Clinton's always saying how Republicans don't follow science?
0.0	0.443145300119	We don't need to raise taxes to get this done.
0.0	0.356135081429	The answer is no.
0.0	0.54568921856	I believe that we have got to move toward a path toward citizenship.
0.0	0.417512001913	It shifts it to the business, and it would allow middle class people to get a tax cut.
0.0	0.24069799946	We lose, we have a trade imbalance...
0.0	0.111556684223	It seems to me that given our history as a nation that has been a beacon of hope for the oppressed, for the downtrodden, that I very strongly disagree with those Republican candidates who say, you know what, we've got to turn our backs on women and children who left their home with nothing, nothing at all.
0.0	0.615699260995	Bernie Sanders has already said it.
0.0	0.391979630321	The question always is, what works better, the private marketplace or government?
0.0	0.141681805978	So I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.282704204737	Thank you.
0.0	0.250908770854	That's why George Romney, Mitt's dad, was eligible to run for president, even though he was born in Mexico.
0.0	0.0992049282822	And I believe people need a leader who is prepared to make tough calls in tough times and stand up...
0.0	0.5	We came back from the dead.
0.0	0.449152585021	You know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in America.
1.0	0.865691014052	Well, the average small manufacturer, whatever they're manufacturing, drugs or anything, if they have less than 50 employees, the average cost in terms of regulations is $34,000 per employee.
0.0	0.0471324233364	And who can blame them?
0.0	0.165842982877	I've learned from him that what we need to achieve is peace through strength, which means we need to rebuild the military.
0.0	0.29957968492	What we need now is a proven leader who has produced results.
0.0	0.206634405943	I think it's a wonderful that that businesses start a 401(k).
0.0	0.339310443833	Not bad.
0.0	0.862195572886	There have been more than 4,000 changes to the tax plan since 2001 alone.
0.0	0.534269847577	I've tried to be as specific to answer questions so that my proposals can be vetted, because I feel like we have to level with people for the very reason, Gwen, that you are mentioning.
0.0	0.23419426014	I like that.
0.0	0.73885423495	And I went to one of these Turkish refugee camps right on the border of Syria.
0.0	0.364177333368	You gotta be patient.
0.0	0.458846730938	I have no clue whether the federal government is the proper place, my instinct is to say, hell no, just about everything about the federal government.
0.0	0.185534658722	I think you do have a humanitarian tragedy there, as I mentioned a moment ago.
0.0	0.428809860441	They are much more than that.
0.0	0.252079218945	Well, Maria, I'm glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what's going on in the world.
0.0	0.635545669464	And under the laws of this country, he wasn't allowed to be with his father for seven years.
0.0	0.423897754528	Akin to slavery, where people came into this country to do guest work were abused, were exploited, and if they stood up for their rights, they'd be thrown out of this country.
0.0	0.156403091107	Eradicate those and you fix Medicare and you've fixed America, its economy and you've made people's lives a heck of a lot better.
0.0	0.5	But then his poll numbers tanked.
0.0	0.460345504185	She was right.
0.0	0.175877600049	And it's important that people really look hard at what the threats and dangers we face are, and who is best prepared for dealing with them.
0.0	0.682384626637	And when I'm president, we're not just going to have a president that gives a State of the Union and says America is the greatest country in the world.
0.0	0.444153868442	We need to bring people together in Washington.
0.0	0.154100313299	Well, Gwen and Judy, thank you very much for hosting this event.
0.0	0.344850792532	...is paid -- played fairly.
0.0	0.522460836149	For both of them you have to gradually raise the age.
0.0	0.29117681244	You can't deal in China without tariffs.
0.0	0.155848596376	... with what Marco is saying is that it takes too long, they're sucking us dry and it takes too long.
0.0	0.310674996736	I know some people like to say, "well, this is free money."
0.0	0.686558710898	So, we're talking about -- we're talking about reform for people like me and people like Senator Cruz, as he talked about earlier, who are years away from retirement that have a way to plan for these changes, and way that's very reasonable.
0.0	0.5	Helping business make profits.
0.0	0.263736774305	I believe in government, but I believe in efficient government, not wasteful government.
0.0	0.243790340725	We're going to let people in, but they're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.534841288137	That was before he was running against me.
0.0	0.140922888796	I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.143543812722	Make our police officers proud of what they do but more important than that, let them know how proud we are of them."
0.0	0.476227145732	You get, like, three days where you have to show up?
0.0	0.446879072011	It's not that complicated actually.
0.0	0.33422717957	Right.
0.0	0.959496717962	And you wanted to know the numbers, the Tax Foundation, which has scored every one of our plans, shows that this plan will allow the economy to generate 4.9 million jobs, to raise wages over 12 percent, and to generate 14 percent growth.
0.0	0.213528813817	It's the New York Times, they are always wrong.
0.0	0.308591829332	Let me just say this.
0.0	0.376680840298	And so that was his explanation.
0.0	0.0806659342308	I say, yes, not only do we give them what they need, but we don't tie their hands behind their backs so that they can go ahead and get the job done.
0.0	0.222760162052	And that's why we're in the trouble that we're in now.
0.0	0.572956425038	I congratulate Secretary of State John Kerry and the president for working on this agreement.
0.0	0.301370409797	Well, let's go with three.
0.0	0.437530072999	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.5	The government has tried it their way.
0.0	0.537131181814	The Egyptians have asked us to share intelligence.
0.0	0.375598227371	There is no money, it's a stack of paper.
1.0	0.609436714416	If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world -- and we double tax, as you know.
0.0	0.334823945968	They didn't save enough money for us to go to school.
0.0	0.491832030339	And the world's financial system is on the verge of collapse.
0.0	0.33607666871	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.379005715954	It never happens.
0.0	0.782485215242	I was governor of New York on September 11.
0.0	0.0935479574641	But I -- the struggle of single moms is extraordinary.
0.0	0.528408729748	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the Constitution.
0.0	0.294708988903	We ought to give them a little bit of a liability release so that they share data amongst themselves and share data with the federal government, they're not fearful of a lawsuit.
0.0	0.389705950656	He does great.
0.0	0.0635911309771	Well, first of all the -- the plan gives people the option of -- of opting out.
0.0	0.153727432792	And I appreciate greatly Senator Sanders' voting record.
0.0	0.420700207134	Ben Carson, can you do math?
0.0	0.312960995805	We're going to start the process of securing that border.
0.0	0.814332408717	And I believe that not only Barney Frank, Paul Krugman, and others, have said that what I have proposed is the most effective.
0.0	0.610152049546	If you take donations from Wall Street, you can't be independent.
0.0	0.358631396023	What we should do is to be investing in all types of energy, John, all types of energy.
1.0	0.30423810009	It got stolen from them.
0.0	0.309425528626	Now, he's doing better.
0.0	0.438567051964	I was the architect.
0.0	0.0904454508074	We will rebuild the military to make sure that it is a solid force, not to be the world's policeman, but to make sure that in a peaceful world, people know that the United States is there to take care of our own national interests and take care of our allies.
0.0	0.779714633403	If it's Medicare for all, then you no longer have the Affordable Care Act, because the Affordable Care Act, as you know very well, is based on the insurance system, based on exchanges, based on a subsidy system.
0.0	0.384913064572	But here's the real key.
0.0	0.267297160134	... they don't like the Wall Street Journal.
0.0	0.520310048629	We will win on everything we do.
0.0	0.53894422484	I don't agree that we're going to occupy and spend another decade or a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.599400409295	Today, many of us picked up our newspapers, and we were horrified to see the sight of 10 American sailors on their knees, with their hands on their heads.
0.0	0.228522788525	If we do that again, we will lose again, we will deserve to lose again.
0.0	0.993648840209	When you have three out of the four largest financial institutions in this country bigger today than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have six financial institutions having assets equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of America, while issuing two-thirds of the credit cards and a third of the mortgages, look, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, that great trust-buster would have said break them up.
0.0	0.308128338801	No.
0.0	0.830415346572	It is imposed on business and a critical piece that Marco seems to be missing is that this 16 percent business flat tax enables us to eliminate the corporate income tax.
0.0	0.792133066961	And I went there, and for 16 years, I fought the insiders and was able to get things done.
0.0	0.309788387057	My point is this.
0.0	0.168098393222	And how do I know it?
0.0	0.917278735007	John, listen, let's keep in mind that for one-third of the 60 million Americans on Social Security it represents 90 percent of their income.
0.0	0.310776125651	Your prosecute criminals.
0.0	0.159682017667	They can have it anyway you want.
0.0	0.114305532111	And you look around, and you see what's happening, and this is not the case when he introduced the doctor -- very nice, everything perfect but that is not representative of what you have in that line of migration.
0.0	0.473174663333	What's crony capitalism?
0.0	0.631785663875	We have to put more money.
0.0	0.491184642692	I looked at the intelligence.
0.0	0.239030258604	They are not perfect.
0.0	0.132614456387	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.601443106169	After the war we had all of these kids, Baby Boomers.
0.0	0.298407425634	(LAUGHTER) I'll tell you what.
1.0	0.428221599442	You know, the FBI director, the president's appointed FBI director has said this week that because of a lack of support from politicians like the president of the United States, that police officers are afraid to get out of their cars; that they're afraid to enforce the law.
0.0	0.366187868188	It will be a way of life.
0.0	0.26084394578	We have no borders.
0.0	0.319496698999	I don't think anybody should expand Medicaid.
0.0	0.195425763155	...
0.0	0.158812488842	There is a war against ISIS, not just against ISIS but against radical jihadists terrorists, and it is a war that they win or we win.
0.0	0.578120553473	My program would move the 104 programs of the federal Department of Education into four block grants, and send them back to the states because income inequality is driven by a lack of skills when kids don't get what they need to be able to compete and win in this country.
0.0	0.339401127021	You want me to answer that question?
0.0	0.295834759504	I'm tired of seeing what's going on, between the border where the people flow over; people come in; they live; they shoot.
0.0	0.134269730565	Well, Maria, thank you for that question, and let me say thank you to the state of South Carolina for welcoming us.
0.0	0.16891278526	We must insist on assimilation -- immigration without assimilation is an invasion.
0.0	0.275711489068	They discussed how -- how hard it is to sell tractors in China, because all the regulatory barriers.
0.0	0.348205044666	And I'm glad I did it.
0.0	0.308691435747	Not just the hacking of OPM, but that is -- that is just shameful.
0.0	0.43658814889	We were wrong.
0.0	0.481686724693	Our country is being run by incompetent people.
0.0	0.436152729094	This is money that people have confiscated out of their paychecks.
0.0	0.435102886046	So I believe as president I will look very carefully about unintended consequences.
0.0	0.448353685547	The first thing is we have to strengthen our alliances around the world.
0.0	0.464478442255	When I'm president, we're going to have a president that acts like it.
0.0	0.470840770332	Every time we send signals like this, we send a signal of weakness, not strength.
0.0	0.425491112502	Nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with.
0.0	0.333230338331	No, I didn't care (inaudible).
0.0	0.309803070314	Now, what I think is that right now we have got to do our best in developing positive relations with Russia.
0.0	0.421060097629	...10% flat rate...
1.0	0.657692101677	But more importantly, in terms of this Libya resolution that you have noted before, this was a virtually unanimous consent.
1.0	0.703676372611	We borrow a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.243333265905	We have to obey the laws.
0.0	0.849921772479	And by the way, the police are the most mistreated people in this country.
0.0	0.338062446892	I do not think we should promise or even look toward normalizing relations because we have a lot of other business to get done with Iran.
0.0	0.657227177252	When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York.
0.0	0.218564992972	Well I want to comment on this.
0.0	0.35386330321	Total propaganda.
0.0	0.426404997338	As you've indicated, what is happening in Syria, the number of people, the hundreds of thousands of people who have been killed -- men, women, 20,000 children, the people who are forced to flee their own country -- their own country -- it is unspeakable.
0.0	0.313951644416	So we need to get on a different mindset.
0.0	0.444402594788	You are working at McDonald's?
0.0	0.508708911819	It would just -- you absolutely have to get involved with China, they are taking so much of what we have in terms of jobs in terms of money.
0.0	0.0348656010247	We need to solve problems, we need to rebuild our military so we can stand up to radical Islam, we need to get our economy growing much faster by throwing out the corrupt tax code and lowering the rates.
0.0	0.312318500345	And Bernie Sanders will tell them that it's because of the rich.
0.0	0.131660668028	It should be what are your substantive positions...
0.0	0.551292492916	And that's an economy where ordinary Americans are working longer hours for low wagers.
0.0	0.282605605729	I would choose Nelson Mandela for his generosity of heart, his understanding of the need for reconciliation.
0.0	0.150461748911	It is an agenda, in my view, that would do great harm to our country.
0.0	0.301775840414	How are we going to do this?
0.0	0.193153091716	You've got a bit of experience, I would imagine.
0.0	0.183165042501	And so do I.
0.0	0.223046084675	This is absolutely disgusting, and revolts the conscience of the nation.
0.0	0.100911040789	We have to be prepared to defend the American people, prepare them for a long war, stand up for the defense of this country, and stand up for the values of this country...
0.0	0.327570783123	I don't think it's so much about when the government orders a corporation to do something.
0.0	0.292549627468	Americans are looking for somebody that's going to give them, and there is a place in this country over the last eight years in particular that talked about hope every day, and they didn't just talk about it, they delivered it.
0.0	0.423692231653	They haven't done that.
0.0	0.486532179787	Before this, I was a very successful person as a developer and as a businessman.
0.0	0.423629989116	I hope Congress says no to this deal.
0.0	0.678966593753	Thousands of people killed, and the cleanup started the next day, and it was the most horrific cleanup, probably in the history of doing this, and in construction.
0.0	0.104269487597	I don't see a lot of weakness on this stage, quite frankly.
0.0	0.227491486401	I know how to do that.
0.0	0.271265456903	How about this?
0.0	0.52937660245	Heck, find me a Republican in Congress that would cut spending ten dollars.
0.0	0.124599001809	I think -- I think it's fair to say we don't have a disagreement.
0.0	0.357484393627	He's wrong.
0.0	0.0827930182463	Let people play, who cares?
0.0	0.332222983155	They have got to quit trying to ship rockets into Gaza that can be used against Israel.
0.0	0.398472198555	They do it to us, we don't it.
0.0	0.700105812471	My four children have been able to receive a good Christian education, and I've been able to save for them to go to college so they never have to have the loans that I did.
0.0	0.239443575267	How about Obamacare, a certified job killer?
0.0	0.533090050158	This is a business flat tax.
0.0	0.404542115589	I want to talk to the folks at home.
0.0	0.202176586506	OK. You know, you judge a nation not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how you treat, we treat, the most vulnerable and fragile people in our nation.
0.0	0.353503097338	The the truth of the matter is, big government benefits the wealthy, it benefits the lobbyists, it benefits the giant corporations.
0.0	0.586956140738	And we fought for statewide school choice, where the dollars follow the child, instead of the child following the dollars.
0.0	0.112922393751	Maria, I'd just like to say...
0.0	0.126706193773	And we finally need to tackle the basics to cut this government down to size and hold it accountable.
0.0	0.180644690009	They are -- they're in a position where they're smothering people.
0.0	0.449646876721	And I have set forth a compact that would do just that for debt-free tuition.
0.0	0.379005715954	It goes away.
0.0	0.606874733144	We both believe there has to be more money going into the Social Security system.
0.0	0.334742311543	Let's start with immigration and have a little bit of clarity.
0.0	0.399844496721	I laid out a plan at the Citadel to do just that and it starts with creating a "No Fly Zone" and "Safe Zones" to make sure refugees are there.
0.0	0.555837925942	Three million women have fallen into poverty under this administration.
0.0	0.457539379443	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.930539303329	We're going to bring jobs back from Japan, we're going to bring jobs back from China, we're going to bring, frankly, jobs back from Mexico where, as you probably saw, Nabisco is leaving Chicago with one of their biggest plants, and they're moving it to Mexico.
0.0	0.262913848966	I'm interested in making sure we get the maximum amount of revenue from those who can well afford to provide it.
0.0	0.763537708907	We've all been talking about tax reforms tonight, and paying for infrastructure is caught right up in tax reform.
0.0	0.175811284518	You know, everyone here talks about the need to take on Washington.
0.0	0.333635341988	And I'm going to tell you this, we need to use the benefit of our law enforcement people across this country, combined with our intelligence people across this country.
0.0	0.14497372063	Next, we have to talk to our adversaries, and we have to make sure they understand the limits of our patience.
0.0	0.299567403507	We need to use our technological advantages, because what we've warned of is an international guerrilla movement that threatens this country.
0.0	0.537970192332	We're not going to be able to rebuild it unless we put a no-fly zone there, make it safe for those folks so we don't have to be talking about Syrian refugees anymore.
0.0	0.515035685767	I talked about Donald Trump from the standpoint of being an individual who was using his celebrity rather than his conservatism.
0.0	0.162594818025	So why are the pharmaceutical companies consolidating?
0.0	0.210099417849	Secondly, as it relates to Iran, we need to confront their ambitions across the board.
0.0	0.591769288671	Now, I for seven years was the U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.23019794725	The fact is if we don't address what's costing so much, we can't throw enough money at this.
0.0	0.206350730589	The contrast with the Democratic debate, where every fawning question from the media was, "Which of you is more handsome and why?"
0.0	0.142611439706	I'd like to just mention something about my tax plan, and how it relates to the discussion...
0.0	0.278488870983	How do we decide on who gets to follow up?
0.0	0.756505052722	I was one of the original sponsors of the DREAM Act.
0.0	0.299392618178	... that's what you say in a primary.
0.0	0.445658669832	Simply expanding Medicaid does not improve health care outcomes.
0.0	0.299870527768	Now you are a worker, white worker, black worker, who had a decent job, that manufacturing job is gone.
0.0	0.251573456645	Our next president, and our Republican nominee can not be someone who supports those positions.
0.0	0.255648847962	But let's not kid ourselves.
0.0	0.5	It's why you see the pharmaceuticals getting together.
0.0	0.559159787368	We will invest in education, and jobs for our kids, not incarceration and more jails.
0.0	0.208951661133	I want to speak to all of those maddened by political correctness, where Hillary Clinton apologizes for saying all lives matter.
0.0	0.5	My mother is on Medicare and Social Security.
1.0	0.666237977875	I would note that Art Laffer, Ronald Reagan's chief economic adviser, has written publicly, that my simple flat tax is the best tax plan of any of the individuals on this stage cause it produces economic growth, it raises wages and it helps everyone from the very poorest to the very richest.
0.0	0.675197903924	Nine months ago, our campaign began.
0.0	0.391396596499	I'm not fighting that.
0.0	0.312149500786	The answer is yes.
0.0	0.357580517397	No, it should be repealed.
0.0	0.116828950664	They have to have some legal basis and precedence for being able to follow the law instead of making the law up, and my goal is -- in appointing Supreme Court justices, would be to point -- to appoint justices who would follow the law.
0.0	0.0818599669861	Look, the truth is that a powerful nation like the United States, certainly working with our allies, we can overthrow dictators all over the world.
0.0	0.347950319662	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.910686247392	The most powerful intelligence agency in the world is going to tell us where we are, the most powerful military in the world is going to destroy them.
0.0	0.450418063639	to save a company.
0.0	0.196350971025	And as a result of that, the shah of Iran came in, terrible dictator.
0.0	0.453343701011	It's tax-free -- a huge advantage for our farmers and ranchers and manufacturers -- and every import pays the 16 percent business flat tax.
0.0	0.131771609745	It's the evil government that is -- that is putting all these regulations on us so that we can't survive.
0.0	0.321317570003	What we need to do is take the rest of the federal entitlements, not just welfare, but food stamps and Medicaid and housing programs and do the same thing we did with welfare.
0.0	0.846180849831	And when I left, we were stronger, we were safer, and we were more united than at any time in my lifetime.
0.0	0.300898691334	What you need to do is free up interest rates.
0.0	0.244019329011	Well, I've been --
0.0	0.198790135183	And you know, he's right.
0.0	0.265298517602	No, no.
0.0	0.794024935713	You see, all of my career, I've fought about giving voice to the people that I grew up with and voice to the people that elected me.
0.0	0.306081504339	You know, that's so simple.
0.0	0.593248194378	I will be the Ronald Reagan if I can find a Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.435206787115	The agreement on humanitarian relief now needs to be implemented, because there are enclaves that are literally filled with starving people throughout Syria.
0.0	0.632666235944	I was a person who has dealt extensively with these homeland security issues.
0.0	0.235538427927	So we have a disagreement on this.
0.0	0.798741006472	And the net result is the middle class has $2,300 less in their pockets than the day that Barack Obama got elected president.
0.0	0.124730575419	Get it done, because our -- our children and grandchildren are counting on us to get it done.
0.0	0.405295351334	I just hope that by the end of this campaign there will be a lot more supporting me.
0.0	0.492388102714	We elected someone as president who wants to change America, who wants to make it more like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.245940384659	But you ought to acknowledge the government doesn't do a very good job at it.
0.0	0.185564033543	I think it's a good product.
0.0	0.50521420759	I'm the only one on this stage who has a plan that's actually reduced -- actually going to reduce immigration.
0.0	0.210136915733	Absolutely, they should fight to fund -- defund Planned Parenthood, and I don't think the president should shut down the government simply to send our taxpayer dollars to this group.
0.0	0.420145480888	This is a great nation.
0.0	0.951359145535	Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the co-chair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat.
0.0	0.0371758735762	And then we need to shut down -- we need to shut down their mechanisms of funding and attack their command-and-control centers.
0.0	0.153106820196	And...
0.0	0.675158558003	Any connection maybe to the fact that our people pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs?
0.0	0.364142670417	There's nobody out there looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.514474138229	And not only did I fight them, but I beat them.
0.0	0.399419771218	His family certainly believes that.
0.0	0.401037435135	It's poor people and middle class.
0.0	0.35220210147	If I could just respond.
0.0	0.620928436251	And that's how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America.
0.0	0.0617867750629	I think to be commander in chief in the 21st century requires someone who understands how the economy works, someone who understands how the world works and who's in it; I know more world leaders on the stage today than anyone running, with the possible exception of Hillary Clinton; understands bureaucracies, how to cut them down to size and hold them accountable; and understands technology, which is a tool, but it's also a weapon that's being used against us.
0.0	0.264878508256	John, I'd like to address this?
0.0	0.246168603409	If there's an act of violence in America, his immediate answer before he even knows the facts is gun control.
0.0	0.651403805655	Now, I can tell you there are a lot of private-sector things that you could do with $12,500, which will get you a lot more than you get from this government program.
0.0	0.614900153109	Every penny we needed from -- every penny we got from Social Security, because my sister was a minor, we needed.
0.0	0.0692292077673	I'm happy to have him tonight...
0.0	0.404065596024	My tax plan enables you to fill out your taxes on a postcard so we can abolish the IRS.
0.0	0.25477865116	And let me make a final point on this.
0.0	0.329701477847	Does he stand up for law enforcement?
0.0	0.264967920456	And that is wrong.
0.0	0.58677773139	But I'm not worried about my finances, I'm worried about the finances of everyday Americans who today are struggling in an economy that is not producing good paying jobs while everything else costs more.
0.0	0.159420692887	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.407732814814	That's a serious issue that we could work on.
0.0	0.627037827707	And I'll tell you what Hillary Clinton has said: Hillary Clinton says she agrees with the dissenters -- the Supreme Court dissenters in the Heller case.
0.0	0.152200006992	Because now he's going a little bit better.
0.0	0.105177462634	What would motivate me and what would be the guiding light for me in terms of immigration reform, Judy, is to bring families together, not divide them up.
0.0	0.373020903471	... on the issue of citizenship, Donald, I'm not going to use your mother's birth against you.
0.0	0.134388544576	There's only a promise to pay by the next generation, and the next generation's not big enough to pay it.
0.0	0.483760733871	That's fine.
0.0	0.140154626201	I mean, you know...
0.0	0.22810980969	But like all of our problems, there isn't a single one that can't be solved with common sense if you remove the ego and the politics.
0.0	0.317139317803	Let me tell you who Larry Tribe is.
0.0	0.564530070704	They built the great wall of China.
0.0	0.406152747441	And they consorted with Barack Obama to steal from Social Security.
0.0	0.244026743296	Make our streets safe again.
0.0	0.420794352163	You blindfold the American people so that they cannot see the true cost of government.
0.0	0.635365663304	Now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world.
0.0	0.104496378201	... and as president, I'm going to fight for the working men and women.
0.0	0.642618020193	This is incredibly complicated, because we've got Iran as a big player, in addition to Russia.
0.0	0.137372899107	The way to take that away from them is to talk to our military officials and ask them, "what do you need in order to accomplish this goal?"
0.0	0.207400239292	So here's this -- the situation, I think, Maria.
1.0	0.758540985965	One out of five Americans can't even afford the prescriptions their doctors are writing.
0.0	0.935107119501	And, it turns out that up until -- and this has blown me away, never in a million years would I have believed that I would be standing here tonight telling you that we have received three and a half million individual contributions from well over a million people.
0.0	0.389760758441	That's a blessing.
0.0	0.348630116091	Creativity.
0.0	0.246860314202	I know this, I certainly am.
0.0	0.250730579999	But I do hope that in years to come, just as occurred with Cuba, 10, 20 years ago, people would say, reach normalized relations with Cuba.
0.0	0.103784624346	But the leaders have come forward to realize that protest is fine, but violence is wrong.
0.0	0.562955422809	I've got a proven record fighting to defend the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.583419630101	And, you know, for six-and-a-half years, we've had a gigantic party.
0.0	0.24210845893	I love this country.
0.0	0.5	Judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.290438296268	I think he is right.
0.0	0.0470404050821	So if we want to pick and choose -- and I certainly do -- people I listen to, people I don't listen to, people I listen to for certain areas, then I think we have to be fair and look at the entire world, because it's a big, complicated world out there.
0.0	0.351532831968	I said right from the beginning that we should take no Syrian refugees of any kind.
0.0	0.581816445148	Let us actually go to zero- based budgeting so we know where the money is being spent.
0.0	0.439918195114	You know, we've got a lot of great talkers running for president.
0.0	0.705926593589	And that's why they have it in Europe, because it is a way to blindfolded the people, that's what Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.698873524439	It's called the value added tax.
1.0	0.351979278626	We don't need the federal government to be involved in this at all.
0.0	0.227421165956	He undermines it.
0.0	0.0218288585924	And listen, there are many, many wonderful, wonderful working men and women in the state of New York.
0.0	0.179757849798	But you know what?
0.0	0.314066710521	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.211307912914	I had to work my way through school.
0.0	0.174160103622	You know, in our country, there are a lot of people who feel as though they just don't have the power.
0.0	0.814019021177	We're one of the fastest growing states in the country.
0.0	0.251751918467	OK.
0.0	0.223174176832	They don't like that.
0.0	0.269318370115	You know, a lot of business activity in America is conducted like the guy that does my dry cleaning.
0.0	0.634391331949	And I would note the Senate just a few weeks ago voted to suspend refugees from Middle Eastern countries.
0.0	0.472359157187	The majority of people in American actually have values and principles and they believe in the very things that made America great.
0.0	0.309839901804	While there are lots of good ideas for reform, we have never tackled the basics.
1.0	0.554557182043	First of all, I didn't support Sonia Sotomayor.
0.0	0.0805283943009	Some do, but many Americans are dying to have an opportunity to grow and to create something inside this economy.
0.0	0.273741338188	The only reason why you're doing it now is because we're running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.
0.0	0.190327174818	I will tell you this, I will beat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.256359093711	And so when we talk to our allies and we give them our word, in a Christie administration, they know we're going to keep it.
0.0	0.445615286771	They've got to quit sponsoring Hezbollah and Hamas.
0.0	0.1537950571	I mean the fact is, is that they need to put the pressure on and frankly we need to intercepts ships coming out of North Korea so they don't proliferate all these dangerous materials.
0.0	0.244881573592	It's not fear and terror, it's reality.
0.0	0.481342307397	And yes, the economy is rigged in favor of those at the top.
0.0	0.754275496002	For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses closing than starting.
0.0	0.633621977478	I voted for comprehensive immigration reform in 2007.
0.0	0.553959997631	Because criminals don't buy their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.615391161621	Part of the reason why it hasn't risen because sometimes we're not giving people the skills they need.
0.0	0.281389298879	I far prefer that and the chances we have to be successful there than trying to start all over again, gridlocking our system, and trying to get from zero to 100 percent.
0.0	0.100095372767	OK, just so you understand -- I know so much about trading about with China.
0.0	0.179058109269	I agree with them.
0.0	0.540048231485	The reason I did so well last time is not just because of the vision, it's because I have a track record in Washington, D.C. of getting things done.
0.0	0.0823619787128	And, that will get to the nub of opportunity for our children, and an ability to see wages rise.
0.0	0.404052262505	When I think about the folks who are out there at home tonight watching, and I think about what they had to watch this week -- the spectacle they had to watch on the floor of the House of Representatives, with the president of the United States, who talked a fantasy land about the way they're feeling.
0.0	0.198540668825	Manufacturing will flow back into this country.
0.0	0.294089858417	We need to arm the Kurds the directly.
0.0	0.46262348133	We're going to cut costs.
0.0	0.185364398242	As a result of his efforts and the efforts of Joe Biden against unprecedented, I was there in the Senate, unprecedented Republican obstructionism, we have made enormous progress.
1.0	0.773615589338	We owe $19 trillion, boy am I good at solving debt problems.
0.0	0.279557160954	But here's the best solution of all.
0.0	0.527695701109	And I would note the other individuals on this stage were nowhere to be found in that fight.
1.0	0.729094872305	In fact, the largest after- tax gains is for the people at the lower end of the tax spectrum under my plan.
0.0	0.457523746	I used the laws of the country to my benefit, I'm sorry.
0.0	0.310648530024	We need security.
0.0	0.27237289341	You want to talk about moral authority.
0.0	0.289582420738	They know.
0.0	0.559650758277	We need leadership, someone who has a backbone and sticks with things, rather than just talks about them as though anything matters when you're talking about amendments that don't even actually are part of a bill that ever passed.
0.0	0.334802856205	You cannot make rash statements and expect the rest of the world to respond as though, well, it's just politics.
0.0	0.486345981719	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.557560758931	I would take the fight to these guys, whatever it took, as long as it took.
0.0	0.515327587153	Well, I've learned the rules on this.
0.0	0.129552996633	But our goal is, in fact, to try over a period of time to, in fact, deal with our enemies, not just ignore that reality.
0.0	0.950270435991	You're looking at the -- at the man who introduced and fought on the floor as a freshman senator and passed the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 over two President Clinton vetoes.
0.0	0.460985127806	They're a scam.
0.0	0.140633665179	That's what they do, whether it's the San Bernardino attack or if it's these tragedies that take place, I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is.
0.0	0.315050200926	I -- I've been for pausing on admitting the Syrian refugees.
1.0	0.490510907163	I don't recall the Sun -- in fact, the Sun-Sentinel endorsed him.
0.0	0.406589332606	Well, I am going to answer your question, Neil.
0.0	0.333718277189	John, I -- if I -- a lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.105476147895	Well, I would begin by reminding people that at this point in previous presidential elections, Jimmy Carter couldn't win, Ronald Reagan couldn't win, Bill Clinton couldn't win, and neither could've Barack Obama.
0.0	0.367538628028	But in addition to that, we have to have fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.197192841482	You know, frankly, I did it in Washington, in Ohio, and I will do it again in Washington, if I'm president, to get this country moving again.
0.0	0.441896327409	Just like getting rid of Medicare and Medicaid.
0.0	0.714580019935	Secretary of state for four years.
0.0	0.366191053435	Right and left are spending us into oblivion.
0.0	0.951678839333	I went into Ohio where we had an $8 billion hole and now we have a $2 billion surplus.
0.0	0.356800950228	Yeah, they are unhinged.
0.0	0.644395392013	We've cut 26 percent of our budget.
0.0	0.691116399559	Why does the fossil fuel industry pay -- spend huge amounts of money on campaign contributions?
0.0	0.622054711406	And I took on the drug companies and I took on the insurance companies to try to get us universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.291899289454	And I would not support those.
0.0	0.281082359347	Think about that.
0.0	0.479087264411	And that's the way my parents came legally in 1956.
0.0	0.264965428493	Do I take the product?
0.0	0.33783663582	I'll tell you, in my family there are a lot of single moms in my family.
0.0	0.293415553165	What I said, and let me repeat it, I don't know what economists Secretary Clinton is talking to, but what I have said, and let me repeat it, that yes, the middle -- the family right in the middle of the economy would pay $500 dollars more in taxes, and get a reduction in their healthcare costs of $5,000 dollars.
0.0	0.272346198436	We need somebody who can lead.
0.0	0.358989955302	So there's a lot of balanced interests.
0.0	0.123820510662	And I believe that the best way to do that is to be aggressive, to be principled, but to have the goal of trying to improve relations.
0.0	0.149078676674	It's time for real substance and real experience.
0.0	0.163710739907	I am, but people are upset, and they're upset for a reason about the future of this country.
0.0	0.6738647278	Trying to get Iran and Saudi Arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter.
0.0	0.240622349186	I believe that when real unemployment is close to 10%, and when our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, Flint, Michigan comes to mind.
0.0	0.771616581096	I can tell you, after spending seven years as a former federal prosecutor, right after 9/11, dealing with this issue.
0.0	0.294243461717	(inaudible).
0.0	0.282704204737	Thank you.
0.0	0.537706787306	But the poll numbers have.
0.0	0.54256238089	Now, the proposal that I have outlined, you know, should be familiar to you, because it is what essentially Barack Obama campaigned on in 2008.
0.0	0.455376355303	It puts us on a level, even playing field, which brings jobs here at home...
0.0	0.416801920502	But I think I'll go back to building buildings if it doesn't work out.
0.0	0.719847725669	When I was 22, my dad died.
0.0	0.215223020785	Well, gee, after the last debate, I was told that I didn't smile enough.
0.0	0.565311747823	Now, when it mattered, he stood up and took on Wall Street.
0.0	0.491549245943	Yes, we've lied to the American people about Social Security, and Medicare.
0.0	0.0222053737636	And -- you know, all of this too big to fail stuff and picking and choosing winners and losers -- this is a bunch of crap, and it is really causing a great deal of -- great deal of problems for our society right now.
0.0	0.212918975609	It's harder to talk to your enemies.
0.0	0.391397204003	I applaud Secretary Kerry and the president for trying to put together this agreement.
0.0	0.151535826524	And I mean, are you kidding me?
0.0	0.404697659707	But I agree with Jeb, you can't just do this by growing the economy.
0.0	0.608001435732	That cost gets passed on to the people.
0.0	0.529766564896	Secretary Clinton, I do have a disagreement here.
0.0	0.291957322231	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.453664880684	-- fix America, this is the formula.
0.0	0.329138085257	John, could I follow up on this?
0.0	0.5	Where basically, businesses now will have to pay a tax, both on the money they make, but they also have to pay taxes on the money that they pay their employees.
0.0	0.805524897253	Every time he's got a chance, going all the way back to -- remember that Great Beer Summit he had after he messed up that time.
0.0	0.131930402751	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you better get rid of the SuperPacs because they causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that have been made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.601955354242	America is back in the leadership business.
0.0	0.157745049198	Everybody is really doing some bad fact...
0.0	0.225346183878	But you know what, you can make a middle class wage, you have decent health care, decent benefits.
0.0	0.887632084368	...The other thing I'd like to make about our plan, one more point, it is the most pro growth tax plan that I can imagine because it doesn't tax investments at all.
0.0	0.110266067551	That's what I think we need to do.
0.0	0.330733027149	-- work better to lift everyone up, men and women.
0.0	0.286285035392	So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.283330671698	And we should back up the recent donors conference to make sure we have made our contribution to try to deal with the enormous cost that these refugees are posing to Turkey and to members of the E.U.
0.0	0.311756079072	But I'm going to tell you the truth.
0.0	0.292590508044	They look around for gun-free zones.
0.0	0.218409204566	Community has to understand that that police officer wants to get home at night, and not -- not to lose their life.
0.0	0.302458862313	It's time for us to stand up for what we believe in.
0.0	0.601932528575	We have more Americans out of work or just Americans who quit looking for work for 40 years.
0.0	0.33422717957	Right.
1.0	0.186200428004	Well, there's not question that we should be able to look at past president whether they're married to somebody who's running for president or not in terms of their past behavior and what it means.
0.0	0.288649166844	And we're letting them get away with it and we can't let them get away with it.
0.0	0.789336868829	That they were going to have to hire 20,000 new IRS agencies to collect it.
0.0	0.737199231068	Probably in terms of the applying for the job of president, a weakness would be not really seeing myself in that position until hundreds of thousands of people began to tell me that I needed to do it.
0.0	0.358236238386	That's right.
0.0	0.0746749801003	I just want to thank all my colleagues here for being civil, and not falling for the traps.
0.0	0.240298000991	They understand that there's a national security risk.
0.0	0.778677438485	23 million files in the hands of the Chinese?
0.0	0.461897117593	I never said that.
0.0	0.737135880139	When I am president of the United States, I'm going to side with Ronald Regan on this and not Nancy Pelosi and we are not having a vat tax.
0.0	0.520845807164	But in the interim, in the absence of that, what's happening is some of these tech companies are taking those -- those centers (ph) to Canada because they can get people to go over there instead of here.
0.0	0.876661699102	It had missed, before I had arrived, expectations for nine quarters in a row.
0.0	0.552308156806	It isn't law-abiding gun owners.
0.0	0.318619916792	And the problem today is there's no confidence in Washington, D.C.
1.0	0.278733040565	I'll tell you what else they're upset about: you're 50 or 51 years old, and some kid walks in and tells you you're out of work, and you don't know where to go and where to turn.
0.0	0.876450861044	This has gone on 50 or 60 years where the United States has been involved in overthrowing governments.
0.0	0.12709373891	But the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, it's to understand what happens the day after.
0.0	0.415177810817	We're going to be actually out there trying to create a better life for hard-working Americans.
0.0	0.86814392682	Let me just say, if you're talking about an $18 trillion economy, you're talking about a 15 percent tax on your gross domestic product.
0.0	0.303573540241	I think there's a sense in this country today that somehow our best days are behind us.
0.0	0.917355388377	One thing I like to remind people is, back in 2007, Rudy Giuliani was leading the polls for almost a year.
0.0	0.154028041283	Folks, you want to --
0.0	0.38114716856	Yes, they have to stop trying to destabilize the Middle East, causing even more chaos.
0.0	0.379991294695	But the president leads in this regard.
0.0	0.230469510526	And -- and -- you know, it goes back to the whole concept of regulations, which are in everything.
0.0	0.410513030177	... of $50 billion...
0.0	0.250948259393	The Emanuel AME church killings.
1.0	0.847497367248	You know, I left my medical practice and ran for office because I was concerned about an $18 trillion debt.
0.0	0.290457228462	And that's why 2016 is a turning point in our history.
0.0	0.362073728728	We have a tremendous problem.
1.0	0.739933544792	My price tag is about $100 billion a year.
0.0	0.14427149613	But if you want someone to drive you home, I will get the job done and I will get you home.
0.0	0.352913387407	It's not my PAC.
0.0	0.322061201885	I am the man who can bring us together to do that, and I ask for your vote.
0.0	0.489880333818	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.253137196263	You know, she only had a third-grade education, but -- you know, she knew how to stretch a dollar.
0.0	0.454686163552	You're not interested in an answer.
0.0	0.29756433791	Why is that?
0.0	0.235865986273	But we also need to reform Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.634193161104	That tells you right away where he was headed on all of this.
0.0	0.257399156073	And we don't need a weak person being president of the United State, OK?
0.0	0.177704408309	And listen, there is a real difference between Marco's tax plan and mine.
0.0	0.481900345446	That is our government today.
0.0	0.210283133085	...Thank you.
0.0	0.311092280143	And that's the reason that I've said under my presidency, we'll create jobs and make American the number one manufacturing country in the world.
0.0	0.425622009797	Thanks for coming back to me, Maria.
1.0	0.581218519862	And in Libya, for example, the United States, Secretary Clinton, as secretary of state, working with some other countries, did get rid of a terrible dictator named Gadhafi.
1.0	0.318670787185	Believe me, that is why Ohio is doing well.
0.0	0.0714919000011	And yes, I am angry.
0.0	0.532376529621	I'm a Catholic, I believe life begins at conception.
0.0	0.583622446833	This is one of the great tragedies in our country today.
0.0	0.977757455067	We used to have 16 workers for one retiree, now you have three workers for one retiree.
0.0	0.4013945721	Well, it's not a matter of what the first executive order would be, Bill.
0.0	0.249430907074	Well, first of all, if a company gets caught doing that, they should never be able to use the program again.
0.0	0.319568798151	I have seen him appoint people to our courts not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.640435586285	Well, look, I think that she's been saying that for as long as I've known her, which is about 25 years.
0.0	0.114570155489	We're going to make a really dynamic economy from what we have right now, which is not at all dynamic.
0.0	0.148632079325	I'm president -- look, I've done it once.
0.0	0.350337032	You have to have certainty.
0.0	0.186267581262	You bet they do.
0.0	0.53541027766	We honest to god are here to get this country back on track.
0.0	0.535074946835	There is no money in the Social Security account.
0.0	0.5	You see, folks, this is how socialism starts.
0.0	0.118852259593	And our economy was growing like crazy.
0.0	0.234689579888	I am against the raids.
0.0	0.34220782118	They're Muslim.
0.0	0.455063265375	We need to get back in the game as it relates to our Arab nations.
0.0	0.60672121847	We got to do a lot about the high cost of high -- higher education, but we've got to make sure we're training people for jobs that exist, that are good jobs that can pay.
0.0	0.5194543569	Let me say first that it is disturbing that every time one of these home-grown terrorist attacks occurs, and, as your question points out, they are occurring with far too great frequency, it turns out we had warning signals.
0.0	0.452270155869	We should put the NSA in charge of the civilian side of this as well.
0.0	0.473471706768	We have Arab allies.
0.0	0.383711434042	And that's what we have to contrast.
0.0	0.253390675836	We have a serious problem with, as you know, with radical Islam.
1.0	0.898970563552	He put a 25 million dollar check up from his own pocket to fund that campaign and my wife Heidi and I, we ended up investing everything we owned.
0.0	0.391901067461	They don't buy their guns from a collector.
0.0	0.581086493242	It always seems to be the private marketplace does a better job.
0.0	0.961856894344	You look at the kind of damage that two people that two people that got married, they were radicalized -- they got married, they killed 15 people in actually 15 -- going to be probably 16 but you look at that and you take a look -- a good strong look and that's what we have.
0.0	0.408305569195	It is why we have to simplify.
0.0	0.22560736502	But everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro- gay-marriage, focus around money and the media.
0.0	0.653255669513	It's all about getting people to listen to one another's problems.
0.0	0.776584670814	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.408283314385	A lot has happened in nine months.
0.0	0.131988780197	Caesar's -- excuse me -- Caesar's, the Rolls-Royce, as you know, is in bankruptcy.
0.0	0.691156415181	I do believe that in the year 2016 we have to look in terms of public education as colleges as part of public education making public colleges and universities tuition free.
0.0	0.672698620549	You get the Congress, you get the Senate, you get together, you do legislation.
0.0	0.270976887322	...before I go.
0.0	0.34971326089	We have -- wait a second, we have $19 trillion in debt.
0.0	0.41545235684	That we work with allies around the world to protect democratic values.
0.0	0.104634748959	You know, we have to stop this because, you know, if we manage to damage ourselves, and we lose the next election, and a progressive gets in there and they get two or three Supreme Court picks, this nation is over as we know it.
0.0	0.562676395637	It will end on January 2017.
0.0	0.426616376471	They like General Motors, so they give them a pass.
0.0	0.195425763155	...
0.0	0.307669365452	Are you coming onboard a proposal?
0.0	0.436854528397	The American people have rejected your agenda and now you're trying to go around it.
0.0	0.217887225353	You sit down and you work with people, you make demands of people, in this case demanding Iran stop the support of international terrorism.
0.0	0.427423182598	These mythical Arab armies that my friends talk about that are going to protect us don't exist.
0.0	0.949992202357	Now, Secretary Clinton's Super PAC, as I understand it, received $25 million dollars last reporting period, $15 million dollars from Wall Street.
0.0	0.38377178952	But it is a general economic issue.
0.0	0.477895651567	You opposed him then.
0.0	0.416379923485	And I think this has become something that needs to be looked at in terms of regulation.
0.0	0.602592333607	That is the way to deal with China at the end of the day.
0.0	0.533963667345	Here, we actually need 1,000 because we have natural barriers.
0.0	0.334530365082	A person who, in fact, has a long experience in foreign-policy issues, which is different from many of the other governors and prospective governors who are running.
0.0	0.468546631459	And the last piece is this.
0.0	0.176296698422	Because, I've got to tell you the truth, even in New Jersey what you're doing is called rude.
0.0	0.348440641301	I can.
0.0	0.408342287836	Maria, you look at what this president and his secretary of state, Secretary of State Clinton, has done to get us in this spot.
0.0	0.384762180885	And yes, I was fired over a disagreement in the boardroom.
0.0	0.232646156899	I'll check for you.
0.0	0.287615186819	We know (ph) to go ahead and shut off the supply routes, and send in our special ops at 2:00 a.m. and attack them everywhere they go.
0.0	0.358798090625	We have got to destroy their training camps and recruiting centers.
0.0	0.473495617089	We're talking about a state that moved graduation rates forward from 27th in the nation to second-highest.
0.0	0.81758756055	They see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on Wall Street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all.
0.0	0.5	And the way we've done it properly through regulatory action, not buy signing unconstitutional executive orders.
1.0	0.524674694416	They stole it.
0.0	0.485959305906	We have not provided them.
1.0	0.645205296355	Now, on the floor of the Congress, the Washington establishment from both parties puts forward a bill that will explode the deficit.
0.0	0.343941413439	This is what's going on.
0.0	0.115172237716	Actually, I'd love to get you to build a wall.
0.0	0.410898361816	That sounds like people are afraid the president's going to take their guns away.
0.0	0.321320814776	We're asking the top 1.5 percent, including passive income, to start paying a little bit more so that the elderly and disabled vets in this country can live with security and dignity.
0.0	0.333924456364	Millions of people have high deductibles and co-payments.
0.0	0.146108472704	I agree, however, it doesn't go far enough, because what it focuses on are the big banks, which Senator Sanders has talked about a lot, for good reason.
0.0	0.415422450755	That's my bill.
0.0	0.361224353383	They shouldn't be going to Europe.
0.0	0.224437565063	But, here is a pledge I've made throughout this campaign, and it's really not a very radical pledge.
0.0	0.264150817266	I'm angry because our country is a mess.
0.0	0.430494680385	It was a coalition made up of Arabs and Americans and westerners and we're going to need it again.
0.0	0.211027697464	Listen, in any Republican primary, everyone is going to say they support the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.10091448243	And guess what?
0.0	0.280931375438	And I think once I'm in the White House we will have enough political capital to be able to do that.
0.0	0.0602955415826	Hey, I'm in the United States Senate, and anyone who doesn't think that there is an enormous amount of waste and inefficiency and bureaucracy throughout government would be very, very mistaken.
0.0	0.189493228589	I would hope that we could all agree that we are sick and tired of seeing videos on television of unarmed people, often African-Americans, shot by police officers.
0.0	0.134596557933	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.339498532055	I can't do it.
0.0	0.825976891833	She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video.
0.0	0.297036532568	We have to protect our 2nd amendment and you cannot do this and certainly what Barack Obama was doing with the executive order.
0.0	0.0650127421101	You know, I think, again, both of us share the goal of trying to make college affordable for all young Americans.
0.0	0.458064292074	We need to lead a force, a Sunni led force inside of Syria.
0.0	0.740619420207	Well, one of us ran against Barack Obama.
0.0	0.203723607233	Listen, I want to just comment.
0.0	0.247267147744	It's very important we focus on the threats we face today, and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in.
0.0	0.260871644644	And -- and -- you know, the concept of New York values is not that complicated to figure out.
0.0	0.472645269292	Nobody can solve it like me.
0.0	0.716139936311	The truth is that sentencing for blacks is higher than for whites.
0.0	0.476229307937	I think that sets us apart from a lot of what's happening right now on the Republican side.
0.0	0.562734828212	You also have to some strategically cutting in several places.
0.0	0.075083024717	But I have no argument with anyone making up her mind about who to support.
0.0	0.119294250702	We need a president that doesn't just talk a game, but a president that's got real results.
0.0	0.403598909923	The Europeans have moved on.
0.0	0.569400498334	Hillary Clinton cannot be president.
0.0	0.344147580531	And multiple reputable journals, including The Wall Street Journal, said ours is the best.
0.0	0.695108267354	Maybe it's because I hadn't given money to the foundation or donated to his wife's Senate campaign.
0.0	0.347746348255	Let me just close it out this way.
0.0	0.205615586862	So -- you know, you shouldn't misrepresent how well you're doing with the polls.
0.0	0.44817184933	But Iran is at the heart of most of the evil that is going on in the Middle East through their proxies.
0.0	0.699660979531	But if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things, including corporate taxes, and including the capital gains taxes, you make that amount up pretty quickly.
1.0	0.549238044453	They were watching the humiliation of our young ten sailors, sitting on the floor with their knees in a begging position, their hands up.
0.0	0.426943557987	We need somebody ready to be commander-in-chief on day one, who understands there are no moderates in Iran, they've been killed a long time ago.
0.0	0.621034479055	In terms of 2007 immigration reform, yeah, I did vote against it.
0.0	0.707304452934	And what you're going to see in Washington this week is establishment Republicans have made an agreement with the president to raise the debt ceiling in an unlimited fashion; no limit to the debt ceiling raise.
0.0	0.223174176832	I don't like that.
0.0	0.282704204737	Thank you.
0.0	0.219071780288	HEMMER: Wow.
0.0	0.510580970391	It's a problem all over the world.
0.0	0.113030261747	Now, let me ask you a question everybody, and, this is for the guy, you know, who owns a landscaping business out there.
0.0	0.5	It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are.
0.0	0.388897295234	It's what I've done or not done, or it's war.
0.0	0.378372149291	Listen, we -- this is the greatest country in the history of mankind.
0.0	0.216460231676	They are worried to death about the future of their kids.
0.0	0.659152249731	Ours was intended to be a citizen government.
0.0	0.589222949166	I was mentioned in the question.
0.0	0.439063512684	I got that.
0.0	0.215936702456	And I think when you give low-income kids -- African-American, white, Latino kids -- the opportunities to get their lives together, they are not going to end up in jail.
0.0	0.551588959351	And not only did I fight them and win, I lived to tell about it and I'm standing on this stage tonight as evidence of that.
0.0	0.524973859469	The only way to figure that out is to go back to getting the intelligence community the funding and the tools that it needs to be able to keep America safe.
0.0	0.378458490067	The domino theory, you know, if Vietnam goes, China, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.
0.0	0.206830327842	In my view, it doesn't go anywhere near far enough.
0.0	0.0835888882307	And I also want to recognize the people in that church that showed the grace of God and the grace of forgiveness and the mercy that they showed.
0.0	0.179091028655	So look, corporations ought to exercise some responsibility.
0.0	0.746172011712	So yes, I will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year pay zero, zero in federal income tax.
0.0	0.175859851429	You will begin to see jobs created in a robust economy.
0.0	0.524220977442	I've had more calls on that statement that Ted made -- New York is a great place.
0.0	0.12309475761	We need a nominee who is going to throw every punch, not pull punches, and someone who cannot stumble before he even gets into the ring.
0.0	0.996088836423	We'll tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money.
0.0	0.818590834014	It was LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations in this country.
0.0	0.359107184513	Because it wouldn't work.
0.0	0.647740608089	We've got a president who instead says, we're going to change hearts and minds.
1.0	0.888495128585	And I know this, because when I ran for governor of New York, one in 11 of every man, woman, and child in the state of New York was on welfare.
0.0	0.385752285646	Folks, we've got to wake up.
0.0	0.567670437956	Why does the pharmaceutical industry make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.65797439871	Had that actually -- that same columnist wrote a column comparing me to an evil demonic spirit from the move, "It Follows" that jumps apparently from body to body possessing people.
0.0	0.321261955241	There is no president, in my view, not Hillary Clinton, not Bernie Sanders, who has the capability or the power to take on Wall Street, large campaign donors, the corporate media, the big money interests in this country alone.
0.0	0.351151343135	And we will join the rest of the other -- the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families.
0.0	0.66718362194	I'll tell them that we're going to grow the economy so that we can give people better opportunities so they don't have to rely exclusively on benefit types of programs.
0.0	0.367004217123	You don't have to.
0.0	0.210393389813	So...
0.0	0.530249710358	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.558667420277	You're an American, as is everybody else on this stage, and I would suggest we focus on who's best prepared to be commander- in-chief, because that's the most important question facing the country.
0.0	0.51003742303	You know, a minute ago, Neil asked: What has President Obama do -- done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns?
0.0	0.753604562146	That has to be enforced absolutely with consequences for Iran at the slightest deviation from their requirements under the agreement.
0.0	0.372565623152	It's peanuts.
0.0	0.925959999315	Well, let me tell you one thing that I am the only guy: The only guy that has consistently fought the Clinton machine every election I was ever in over the past 26 years.
0.0	0.693855021254	If we want to create jobs for the folks that you're talking about, who are having trouble getting off government benefits, primarily because of their low skill level, there is no better way -- it's worked for 100 years in America -- putting people back to work in manufacturing is it.
0.0	0.337445103217	But I guess I'm supposed to come out great.
0.0	0.332673867282	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.162946424629	We need a unifier, not a cynical divider in chief, and that's exactly what I will do.
0.0	0.249179810529	And I'll tell you, I'm not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump.
0.0	0.704041486254	Focus on the diseases that are costing us the trillions of dollars.
0.0	0.522462721007	And what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice.
0.0	0.0742358244152	We need to make sure that we do everything across all kinds of energy: natural gas, oil, absolutely.
0.0	0.778085192173	And nobody watching at home believed that any of the moderators had any intention of voting in a Republican primary.
0.0	0.310896789179	No, John.
0.0	0.321256961243	Those are the things we brought, and we were able to get things done.
0.0	0.557199146808	So count me in as somebody who will not be listening to Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.334868734875	You don't have to say that.
0.0	0.329542321434	I believe that we have got to pass comprehensive immigration reform, something that I strongly supported.
0.0	0.753565660276	In many ways, a college degree today is equivalent to what a high school degree was 50, 60 years ago.
0.0	0.972995330706	And in fact, Kissinger's actions in Cambodia, when the United States bombed that country, overthrew Prince Sihanouk, created the instability for Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge to come in, who then butchered some 3 million innocent people, one of the worst genocides in the history of the world.
0.0	0.332568381451	But that's not an accurate description of the plan.
0.0	0.355609941739	I have.
0.0	0.346997360862	Regulations in this country are out of control, especially the Employment Prevention Agency, the EPA, and all of the rules they continue to impose on our economy and hurting us.
0.0	0.0836686140437	And hopefully -- you know, Senator Graham, I -- I know where he's going to be on this, but we use Congress, and we use Congress to cut this funding.
0.0	0.717457360063	I will cut this government down to size and hold it accountable, simplify the tax code, roll back the regulations that have been spewing out of Washington, D.C. for 50 years.
0.0	0.285695664996	Let's listen to them and let's not listen to our politicians.
0.0	0.0819360285862	So I just truly, with all my heart belief, I like everybody on the stage.
0.0	0.129005803178	And meanwhile, small businesses are getting crushed.
0.0	0.11529163465	And I'm going to tell you, that it -- I'm going to suggest to you here tonight, that you can't do on the job training.
0.0	0.480096219297	And that's what I'll offer to the people of the United States in this candidacy for the presidency.
0.0	0.523530413067	We went after companies that were doing things that were against the law.
0.0	0.208551769093	Or would you rather take less later on?
0.0	0.812388371077	It's a -- it's absolutely disgraceful that Secretary Kerry and others said in their response to what's going on in Iran that this was a good thing; it showed how the relationship was getting better.
0.0	0.494920007371	They said they'd shrink and balance the budget.
0.0	0.55668557023	What we have to do right now is bring our people together and understand that we must provide a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people.
0.0	0.120507279431	If we're gonna reform welfare for poor people, we ought to reform it for rich people, as well.
0.0	0.229285165671	Well, you're talking about -- yeah.
0.0	0.177469640055	So let's demand open trade but fair trade in this country.
0.0	0.282704204737	Thank you.
0.0	0.239902441409	Let me just -- let me respond.
0.0	0.623932974739	But the idea that you can't -- that you're just gonna grow your way out of this -- I have a plan to grow the economy at 4 percent, but you're gonna have to make adjustments for both Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.412485481693	I'm looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.344092198087	I'll suggest a part of that was his celebrity.
0.0	0.536446640517	I try to live by the rules, no matter what they are, and I was brought up that way as a kid.
0.0	0.243524942138	And here's an area where Secretary Clinton and I believe we have a difference.
0.0	0.0471374104291	Big government favors the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected, and crushes the small and the powerless.
0.0	0.0482549500371	So, yes, I do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white Americans -- particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have -- you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is.
1.0	0.323595760711	And again, paid for.
0.0	0.283974264836	Think about it.
0.0	0.256624246252	That is a bad deal and an evil situation, and presidents have looked the other way.
0.0	0.589379001445	Let's take the money that we would give to Planned Parenthood and put it in women's health care without having to harvest the organs of the unborn.
0.0	0.412050338617	I'm a free trader.
0.0	0.318870412823	We need to reverse that.
0.0	0.273805742792	People are waking up because it is going to be us who will determine the direction of our country.
0.0	0.135604323269	They don't believe in building walls and a pessimistic view of the future.
0.0	0.15084275538	But I want to go further.
0.0	0.169150560619	We need fundamental police reform, clearly, clearly, when we talk about a criminal justice system.
0.0	0.592734971161	It turns out we knew something was wrong.
0.0	0.227517605763	I have...
0.0	0.648950422424	People are being released from jail without the education, without the job training, without the resources that they need to get their lives together, then they end up -- we're shocked that they end up back in jail again.
0.0	0.508738584585	But here's the best way that we're going to make America much more exceptional: it is to make sure we put someone on that stage in September who will fight Hillary Clinton and make sure she never, ever gets in the White House again.
0.0	0.167972648335	Bad by those in the Senate who voted for it and if I'm president, we'll make our intelligence community strong, and won't have to keep everybody out, we're just going to keep the bad folk out and make sure they don't harm us.
0.0	0.330474010585	That's not right.
0.0	0.892972343595	Why are there five even bigger Wall Street banks now, instead of the ten we used to have on Wall Street?
0.0	0.187765540366	They do whatever what they do, OK.
0.0	0.489686072962	We had Hamas.
0.0	0.248874010212	You know, as I said already twice in this debate, we have a very serious problem in this country.
0.0	0.157920151005	My father used to say, "Johnny, we never -- we don't hate the rich.
1.0	0.747478012981	You used to say that you were in favor of birthright citizenship, now you say that you are against it.
0.0	0.239550257243	I mean, literally, the Senate -- what is it, like a French work week?
0.0	0.114266756137	Good question, but I want to tell you, my great concern is that we are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job.
0.0	0.155556285552	That is total propaganda, and this is what happens in our society.
0.0	0.59355294918	We owned a liquor store, restaurant, bar and we lived in the back.
0.0	0.0577354375782	I can tell you, there wouldn't have been much damage.
0.0	0.6752911888	I think they made the Second Amendment the second amendment because they thought it was just that important.
0.0	0.150491444923	... no, you already had your chance, Marco, and you blew it.
0.0	0.506710841311	And I make a lot more than the average American.
1.0	0.531013370813	But I want to -- I want to follow up on something having to do with leadership, because, you know, today Senator Sanders said that President Obama failed the presidential leadership test.
0.0	0.304954265561	It's like them getting mugged, and then us saying, well, we're going to mug you some more.
1.0	0.608500859688	The Oregon study showed this.
0.0	0.385303137898	Jeb Bush, why have your numbers fallen?
0.0	0.5	In the same light, as the foreign leader, Winston Churchill's politics were not my politics.
0.0	0.199218692071	Many businessmen want to endorse me.
0.0	0.311503081331	This guy is a petulant child.
0.0	0.447352836735	They told you that your Social Security money is in a trust fund.
0.0	0.243469558638	If these are the kinds of people -- we should use our best and our finest.
0.0	0.031056595404	Because when government gets big and powerful, the big feel like they need to get even bigger to deal with all that power, and meanwhile, the small and the powerless -- in this case, 1,590 community banks -- go out of business.
0.0	0.535947828889	It's actually evidence of the bias that exists in the American media today.
0.0	0.472866502154	When the Social Security program was started in the 1930s, not very many women worked.
0.0	0.481949478581	We can take many of those same procedures, we can apply it to Medicare.
0.0	0.201352426744	What -- what -- you're from New York?
0.0	0.406023360402	And that's just not acceptable.
0.0	0.174524024524	I'm totally open to a tariff.
0.0	0.536302501194	You know, I listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas.
0.0	0.5	See, in Ohio, we've had some controversial decisions.
0.0	0.450546630089	The government is not supposed to be in every part of our lives, and that is what is causing the problem.
0.0	0.432706292268	Look, I am deeply concerned about what's happening in every community in America, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths.
0.0	0.380420097672	And this deal is giving him a pathway to a bomb, a missile to deliver it, and money to pay for it all.
0.0	0.222775228787	It is Iran that's the expansionist power.
0.0	0.334019834208	And yes, it was a very difficult time.
0.0	0.0487351790125	Well, you know, I think, from a historical point of view, somebody with my background, somebody with my views, somebody who has spent his entire life taking on the big money interests, I think a Sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment, as well.
0.0	0.555567743652	Today a male African-American baby born today stands a one-in-four chance of ending up in jail.
0.0	0.338373385453	But here's the point I want to make tonight.
0.0	0.460092303043	That's how you make peace in the world.
0.0	0.425632664832	There are politics in the boardroom as well.
0.0	0.434059504202	In this particular moment of serious crises, saying to the American people don't give up on the political process.
0.0	0.0857788420095	I absolutely would call on them to collaborate and cooperate, yes.
0.0	0.192631006594	And in fact I would go further.
0.0	0.41329835781	Well, let us level with the American people.
0.0	0.896194414314	But I knew that good people who wanted to be a part of the American dream have become trapped in dependency because the federal government and the state government had made it in their economic interest not to take a job because the benefits that they didn't work were better.
0.0	0.5	The second thing I said is we need to add reforms, not just increase the numbers, but add reforms.
0.0	0.377096253627	You know, you look at women working.
0.0	0.845163516504	Kissinger was one of those people during the Vietnam era who talked about the domino theory.
0.0	0.244508219172	I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would.
0.0	0.386172997841	And if we capture any of them alive, they are getting a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know.
0.0	0.109312473725	We need to create jobs.
0.0	0.421346082198	I hope the Supreme Court upholds them.
0.0	0.467478470888	And if I could say just one thing.
0.0	0.106702480502	Now, we're going to blame the people.
0.0	0.556121887937	This is not some small scale group.
0.0	0.282313509247	See?
0.0	0.141205615202	So I don't know if you would call that a weakness, but my wife said "let up."
0.0	0.545872146215	Half of American seniors would be in poverty without a Social Security check.
0.0	0.290870851328	You know that.
0.0	0.488978466529	Here's the deal, Chris is totally right.
0.0	0.137069919073	But I think this is a worldwide -- that the entire world needs to come together to deal with this horrific refugee crisis we're seeing from Syria and Afghanistan, as well.
0.0	0.127813031935	I've created tens of thousands of jobs, and in all due respect -- and actually some of these folks I really like a lot -- but I'm the only one that can say that.
0.0	0.31851017216	And as president of the United States, it's all about communication, folks.
0.0	0.61713904087	I'm in favor of people coming into this country legally.
0.0	0.0451159903039	And Mexico's going to pay for the wall because Mexico -- I love the Mexican people; I respect the Mexican leaders -- but the leaders are much sharper, smarter and more cunning than our leaders.
0.0	0.0601783469187	Our decision is, then, do we give them what we need.
0.0	0.0237440730658	Such a nasty -- such a nasty question, but thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.524415227383	I have a bill to fix Medicare.
0.0	0.357827278673	Do senators have the right to disagree with the president?
0.0	0.5	We're running surpluses.
0.0	0.513574518924	He was kind of a conservative guy in many respects.
0.0	0.814107494299	Well, first off, let's face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.797451571489	You had only 21 Republican governors in this country.
0.0	0.257323061578	I'm not blaming Chris, by the way, but he will know about that.
0.0	0.268396578906	The Kurds are our strongest allies.
0.0	0.20970963877	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government in setting up -- retirement plans.
0.0	0.868419736933	If a person lives in a seven room house, does the government get to say you don't need seven rooms, we're going to take two of them away?
0.0	0.361446100896	I agree with my colleagues.
0.0	0.558460043303	Well first of all, the idea that somehow we're better off today than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated president of the United States is totally an alternative universe.
0.0	0.534613107323	Because I think we have to get to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.279498240847	Here's my second problem.
0.0	0.510862000973	We have to find out -- many people knew about what was going on.
0.0	0.359287931109	That's exactly what we saw.
0.0	0.344055628237	don't listen to the Trumps of the world and allowing them to divide us.
0.0	0.250553128855	I think it was a mistake to expand Medicaid everywhere in Ohio and across the country.
0.0	0.850600829361	I've got the backbone, I've got the band width, I've got the experience to get us through this.
0.0	0.482742417016	And it is a -- the kind of criticism that we've heard from Senator Sanders about our president I expect from Republicans.
0.0	0.20563212042	There are loads of great ideas, great conservative ideas from wonderful think tanks about how to reform the tax code.
0.0	0.458429611851	Thousands of thousands -- you look at the number of companies and the number in terms of manufacturing of plans that we've lost -- 50,000 because of China.
0.0	0.467439605496	Could I -- could I bring something up here, because I'm a constituent of the senator and I helped him and I expected that he would do constituent service, which means that he shows up to work.
0.0	0.174191315657	And when I look at Washington today, we need to bring us together.
0.0	0.0935384016845	... and I know Bernie, and I can promise you he's not going to be president of the United States.
0.0	0.719903412456	After that you pay 10 percent as a flat tax going up.
0.0	0.566620030104	We have people out of work.
0.0	0.60909042294	And by the way, as important as those two phone calls are, they are also very important because they say this.
0.0	0.246035864804	Like rich kids, they deserve to get a free education.
0.0	0.349664067192	Maria, I'd like to interrupt this debate on the floor of the Senate to actually answer the question you asked, which was on entitlements.
0.0	0.0580166243067	It is disgraceful, and in a Christie administration, they would know much, much better than to do that.
0.0	0.53483438483	I've got a very simple strategy as your president against ISIL.
0.0	0.239421291785	And, sometimes we're held up in contempt by people who write columns, but, I guarantee you to every person on this stage there's something deep inside of us that would cause us to give up our livelihoods and step out on this stage and fight for the people of America.
0.0	0.0496965959239	First of all, I'd like to recognize Governor Haley for her incredible leadership in the aftermath of the --
0.0	0.340576251697	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.354595589943	You know, I think most people know exactly what New York values are.
0.0	0.356591208557	I don't remember you ever complaining about John McCain's vote record.
0.0	0.115335015896	And what I think all of us are saying is, our monetary policy, our tax policy, regulatory policy needs to be radically changed so we can create high sustained growth for income to rise.
0.0	0.138017512974	And wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong.
0.0	0.363506114386	I'm just saying.
0.0	0.158453079576	I will not shock anybody to suggest that in politics there is occasionally a little bit of hypocrisy.
0.0	0.78669170391	Secondly, in our state, we went from a loss of 350,000 jobs to, now, a gain of 347,000 jobs to the positive.
0.0	0.0664501805052	-- the governor's absolutely right.
0.0	0.666016712739	The agreement on a cease-fire, though, is something that has to be implemented more quickly than the schedule that the Russians agreed to.
0.0	0.123519648398	This mandatory sentencing, a very bad idea.
0.0	0.14382598285	For a start, the secretary and I disagree -- and I think the president does not agree with her -- in terms of the concept of a no-fly zone in Syria.
0.0	0.367905808352	I hope you will make a decision soon on this.
0.0	0.238181972586	I mean, Chris will know about that.
0.0	0.203516078865	Judy, if I can, there is no question, Secretary Clinton and I are friends, and I have a lot of respect for her, that she has enormous experience in foreign affairs.
0.0	0.757805402648	And if you make $40,000 a year, a family of four, you don't pay any income tax at all.
0.0	0.066001568282	You know, whatever your issue, your cause, the festering problem you hoped would resolved, the political class has failed you.
0.0	0.532784911948	The truth is I had to make some tough calls in some tough times.
0.0	0.183841004989	So, yes, we can talk about it as a racial issue.
0.0	0.761963458027	You're talking about $2.7 trillion.
0.0	0.363720754878	That should be a right of all Americans regardless of the income of their families.
0.0	0.517491703395	When I'm president of the United States, we are going to win this war on ISIS.
0.0	0.146070778807	And I think that ought to be worth something.
0.0	0.740849856768	I worked hard with not only federal agents but with police officers and here's the problem, sanctuary cities is part of the problem in this country.
0.0	0.0941069723831	I would like to start with a basic.
0.0	0.192036744093	I certainly agree with FDR for all the reasons Senator Sanders said.
0.0	0.926131089911	Last week in a CNN town hall, the Senator told a questioner that the questioner would spend about $500 dollars in taxes to get about $5,000 dollars in healthcare.
1.0	0.32321715528	That's exactly what the Republican establishment says too.
0.0	0.342562119172	They're leaving because of taxes, but they are also leaving because they can't get their money back and everybody agrees, Democrats and Republicans, that is should come back in.
0.0	0.389552792822	Someone's going to be collecting this tax.
0.0	0.555955975991	The other Arab countries have a role to play in this.
0.0	0.114102688411	I don't think it's a war on women for all of us as Americans to stand up and stop harvesting organs from little babies.
0.0	0.757492149277	Meantime, wages have stagnated for 40 years.
0.0	0.392399076074	Instead, the Washington establishment raised both.
0.0	0.348385374768	Well, a couple of things.
0.0	0.593819142862	Well, you just -- you just listed a litany of discredited attacks from Democrats and my political opponents, and I'm not gonna waste 60 seconds detailing them all.
0.0	0.18168140213	A law has been sitting -- languishing, sadly, on Capitol Hill and has not yet been passed, and it would help.
0.0	0.169563922939	Let's hope that it holds.
0.0	0.393284622573	And they will work with me to get comprehensive immigration reform.
1.0	0.640877741404	Well, Marco has been floating this attack for a few weeks now, but the problem is, the business flat tax in my proposal is not a vat.
0.0	0.542893698488	And I would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country.
0.0	0.419776974249	If a soldier has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.657382891312	Well, he appointed Eric Holder as attorney general.
0.0	0.520183116023	All over this country we have Republican candidates for president saying we hate the government.
0.0	0.546689792352	Here's what I would do Neil, I would appoint an Attorney General and I would have one very brief conversation with that Attorney General.
0.0	0.274466592389	We are trying to bring America together around an agenda that works for working families and the middle class.
0.0	0.323004316145	That, I think, between the two of us demonstrates the strength of the support we have among people who want to see change in our country.
0.0	0.731147909766	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.0545698074566	For once, let's do that, and stop trying to give them some kind of fantasy that's never going to come true.
0.0	0.390994858264	You can't do it with empty promised.
0.0	0.862694406656	I deployed the National Guard after I stood on the ramp in Dallas, Texas and looked the president of the United States in the eye and said, "Mr. President, if you won't secure the border, Texas will," and that's exactly what we did.
0.0	0.222101251414	He is the party's frontrunner right now, and good for him.
0.0	0.776584670814	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.169823292677	But my wife is down here in the front, and I'm sure, if you'd like to talk to her later, she can give you more than you'll ever be able to take care of.
0.0	0.649519994	The first impulse of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton is to take rights away from law- abiding citizens.
0.0	0.646273769087	Marco's top tax rate is 35 percent.
0.0	0.936799604964	Two of them were among the most highly decorated -- they weren't allowed on a military base to have guns.
0.0	0.630849474134	Because of a series of disastrous trade policies which have allowed corporate America through NAFTA and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, Secretary Clinton and I disagree on those issues.
0.0	0.651993361289	You know, 200 years ago, America was founded on this powerful principle that our rights don't come from government.
0.0	0.566804627863	They are radicalizing people in the United States, they are conducting attacks around the world.
0.0	0.0703028470543	I mean, she would drive a car until it wouldn't make a sound, and then gather up all her coins and buy a new car.
0.0	0.952731799041	Planned Parenthood had better hope that Hillary Clinton wins this election, because I guarantee under President Jindal, January 2017, the Department of Justice and the IRS and everybody else that we can send from the federal government will be going in to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.17014938382	It works very, very well.
0.0	0.720383321105	We don't need the Federal Government to be involved in this, because when they do we create a $1.2 trillion debt.
0.0	0.605367843393	Detailed plans count, and I believe that the plan I've laid out to destroy ISIS before the tragedies of San Bernardino and Paris are the right ones.
0.0	0.430564883131	The guns don't pull the trigger.
0.0	0.364489013034	And by those standards, we're not doing particularly well.
0.0	0.65657296668	I've had my issues with Donald Trump.
0.0	0.900811031065	We cut taxes and we had a $5 trillion projected surplus when I left.
0.0	0.441747098318	What we are talking about in reality is a corrupt campaign finance system, that's what we're talking about.
0.0	0.162192273554	But in terms of shutting down the government, I don't think President Obama should choose to shut down the government simply to send taxpayer dollars to this group that has been caught, I believe, breaking the law, but also offending our values and our ethics.
0.0	0.0860086201349	We need to know who our neighbors are.
0.0	0.383652319117	You can trust me to do the following: that when I get on change with Hillary Clinton, we won't be debating about the science, we'll be debating about the solutions.
0.0	0.140707441892	... on the issue -- on the issue of citizenship, Donald...
0.0	0.392179542972	Those aren't Iowa values, but this is what we believe in New York."
0.0	0.357797874084	And the fact of the matter is if we give them a mission and we don't tie their hands behind their back, they can get it accomplished.
0.0	0.231990287725	Well, first of all, like many other very big businessmen, I could name them here, but I'm not going to do that for a lot of obvious reasons, but the biggest, and almost all of them, they've all used the chapter laws, the bankruptcy laws to their own benefit.
0.0	0.463746228662	China and Russia have never been on our side of the table.
0.0	0.192631106552	I find it very, very hard to forgive people that deceived me.
0.0	0.358141655759	They don't want them made here.
0.0	0.107779851526	If i were the president of the United States, I would go and look at every executive order that exists right now and determine which ones want to be voided, because the president shouldn't be legislating: not through that vehicle or any other.
0.0	0.578250354149	In fact, frankly, he's complaining about the fact that we're losing some of the most talented people.
0.0	0.667376594382	I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King.
0.0	0.14807631824	And Carl -- Carl, I'm not finished yet.
0.0	0.349510713587	But the ideal scenario is to train Americans to do the work so we don't have to rely on people from abroad.
0.0	0.245511067584	We also want to dominate this from a commercial side.
0.0	0.516799086552	Growth is the answer.
0.0	0.318267585415	... on Larry Tribe.
1.0	0.455026156997	And let us be clear that every proposal that I have introduced has been paid for.
0.0	0.456688484321	Or, are you going to deal with the problem by saying, I'm going to give people who've done well in this country less benefit on the backend.
0.0	0.483691649064	President Obama and I are friends.
0.0	0.322300799849	It goes in the right direction.
0.0	0.55729598569	We have to do this in unison with the Arab world.
0.0	0.270935581339	We'll just clean it up.
0.0	0.41891293637	And specifically, we know that we could have detected and repelled some of these cyber attacks if that collaboration had been permitted.
0.0	0.168363767367	But -- if for some reason, Neil, he beats the rest of the field, I already know the Democrats are going to be bringing a suit.
0.0	0.400536830631	People in Washington think they were sent there to be adults and govern and do all this.
0.0	0.531174824458	What I said was I don't believe that I would be president of the United States and have the same dysfunction that exists in Washington, D.C. now.
0.0	0.128680426042	It's got great people, it's got loving people, wonderful people.
1.0	0.336068525591	We have the world's best military, even though he's done everything he can to diminish it.
0.0	0.088021065492	I do, however, believe in Reagan's 11th commandment, and will not be engaging in awful things about my compatriots here.
0.0	0.228864876299	Our next president...
0.0	0.254795337819	Sometimes you win a war by killing murderous, evil terrorists.
0.0	0.0747184899788	We need to make the government run smarter and better, and reform this corporate tax system, bring that money back to the United States to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, and we need to use it also to protect our grid from terrorists.
0.0	0.929686624815	I voted against it because the Southern Poverty Law Center, among other groups, said that the guest-worker programs that were embedded in this agreement were akin to slavery.
0.0	0.24684031987	OK, good.
0.0	0.184091904853	In my administration, we will help to make sure we bring people together in the Middle East, and we will fight ISIS and defeat them.
0.0	0.718781774509	Every single time that there has been a Defense bill in the Senate, three people team up to vote against it.
0.0	0.553674225888	She admitted she had sent e-mails to her family saying, "Hey, this attack at Benghazi was caused by Al Qaida-like elements."
0.0	0.767608965039	And by the way, the attack he keeps throwing out on the military budget, Marco knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion.
0.0	0.277828197768	That's for sure.
0.0	0.454348587585	That's how you solve the problem.
0.0	0.341738429406	This president has failed, and when I'm in the Oval Office, police officers will know that they will have the support of the president of the Untied States.
0.0	0.589240217535	I have the opportunity not just to run, but to win in the deep blue state of New York three times.
1.0	0.38333549023	It's not theirs anymore.
0.0	0.43720056603	We need all of them to be part of exactly what the first George Bush put together in the first Gulf War.
0.0	0.711950594269	I have the largest bank in the world as a tenant of mine.
0.0	0.61358409152	Low income people who are not involved in the political process.
0.0	0.965108112554	I started as a secretary and became ultimately the chief executive of the largest technology company in the world, almost $90 billion in over 150 countries.
0.0	0.255698038821	Why?
0.0	0.176027703415	Just want to get that out there, just saying.
0.0	0.541326726056	He is not the only one.
0.0	0.331715005545	And they say down as a group trying to make sure that we can begin to heal some of these problems that we see between community and police.
0.0	0.713472544194	If you saw that blimp that got cut loose from Maryland today, it's a perfect example of government.
0.0	0.465404359114	And based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don't add up, and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now.
0.0	0.766062994065	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.669155953169	The law itself requires a background check, but that didn't fulfill their part of the bargain within the time that they were supposed to do.
0.0	0.528691881585	I know we can do this because we're still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.9330495296	And remember this, after Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have had nearly 8 years, we have fewer democracies in the world than we had when they started.
1.0	0.492365872565	Everybody voted for it wanting to see Libya move toward democracy, of course we all wanted to do that.
0.0	0.284119095834	Well, I want to know, did you win?
0.0	0.52063771288	You have to deal with entitlements, you have to be in a position to control discretionary spending.
0.0	0.300527380794	Well, first of all, under President Jeb Bush, we would restore the strength of the military.
1.0	0.361063124973	Our military is a disaster.
0.0	0.907092528517	My 750,000 donors have contributed more than a million and a half donations.
0.0	0.446727193578	They are the ones who should respond to any questions.
0.0	0.213892179552	... in addition to that, we go ahead and we take the oil from them, their source of revenue.
0.0	0.163175987862	And we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid.
0.0	0.313089660552	I can do that.
0.0	0.588581149161	Mine is the only plan that saves over $1 trillion and that's why I'm answering your question.
0.0	0.167950328885	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.392396440784	You have to ban the people who are trying to hurt us.
0.0	0.168411226662	By the way, unlike our country where we're totally predictable and the enemy, whether it's ISIS or anybody else, they know exactly what we're doing because we have the wrong leadership.
0.0	0.400508566004	You get the Senate.
0.0	0.436660123913	You just have to look today at Indonesia, bombings all over.
0.0	0.316701229799	I'm the only guy on this stage -- you know, everybody has an "only guy" -- "I'm the only guy this; I'm the only guy that."
0.0	0.331793186328	And I recognize -- I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa.
0.0	0.366159741686	You have to reform Social Security, and the simple way to do it is to make sure that the wealthiest don't receive the same benefits as people that are lower-income.
0.0	0.5	That debate reflected a debate between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks.
0.0	0.227706127582	And, I'll do that with the country.
0.0	0.0543429354179	The fact is, the reason why...
0.0	0.369173819061	Or how about Boeing right here within a mile?
0.0	0.594883759981	I'm the only person on this stage who's done that and we will get it done as President of the United States.
0.0	0.739502671904	The Kurds have been asking us to arm them for three years.
0.0	0.156712592578	And here's why.
1.0	0.887765301121	One, Senator Sanders voted in 1998 on what I think is fair to call a regime change resolution with respect to Iraq, calling for the end of Saddam Hussein's regime.
0.0	0.974991830048	I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years, and by the way, one of the members of that committee was Senator Strom Thurmond from South Carolina.
0.0	0.5	I want to go back to what we were talking about earlier, this budget deal in Washington.
0.0	0.682695108709	And the reason is simple: because in 2008, we elected as president someone who wasn't interested in fixing America.
0.0	0.218675475555	There's something going on and it's bad.
0.0	0.765169203125	It was some of the most progressive members of the United States Congress who opposed it for that reason.
0.0	0.510087597589	We don't need newer (ph) laws.
0.0	0.5	Here at home, we've got to do a better job coordinating between federal, state, and local law enforcement.
0.0	0.415080910544	I suspect you may have.
0.0	0.74797670919	My point is this: I won two landslide elections, I made big changes.
0.0	0.624595723786	They're taking money from Social Security and they're going to spend it on the military and they're going to spend it on domestic spending.
0.0	0.510755675632	It's you see the health insurance companies getting together.
0.0	0.237765645547	And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word.
0.0	0.518813600252	Here's the bottom line.
1.0	0.880666225528	Not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama and the big government economy, the median wage for women has dropped $733.
0.0	0.412532977422	What he said, and he said it in the last debate, it's simply not true.
1.0	0.85260062977	Let's not have the most expensive business tax rate in the world.
0.0	0.20271518069	And I'll allow putting that tariff or whatever he's saying here...
0.0	0.413783645434	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.200854669083	This is the fantasy...
0.0	0.241566033283	Well, I mean right here.
1.0	0.400289926752	We have 400,000 small businesses forming every year in this country.
0.0	0.605958071765	The questions that have been asked so far in this debate illustrate why the American people don't trust the media.
0.0	0.542914084127	It'll be a pretty busy day, but that Iran negotiation is going to be torn up on day one.
0.0	0.315789055399	I'll talk to them.
0.0	0.171405498879	Much of the discussion is centered over whether or not the different tax plans help, or affect the middle class.
0.0	0.708822881325	It's the only way you fix Medicare, the only way you fix Social Security.
0.0	0.39456637304	I've been passionate my whole life about the Constitution.
0.0	0.398412928436	And I'm glad that I have a chance to answer this question.
0.0	0.179757849798	And you know what?
0.0	0.479841279075	I think he would have said bring back a 21st-century Glass-Steagall legislation.
0.0	0.490458247463	Maria -- Maria, what you were talking about just now is called corporate inversion.
0.0	0.488847788221	Since I was attacked too.
0.0	0.34243976696	She was naturalized.
0.0	0.0725746478006	Well, you know what I'm worried about?
0.0	0.508955028375	That's gonna be the real growth engine.
0.0	0.898592291491	Or we're going to ship 10 million Americans -- or 10 million people out of this country, leaving their children here in this country and dividing families?
0.0	0.246995265115	The deployments are too high for the military personnel.
0.0	0.736620737222	President Obama's preparing to send $100 billion or more to the Ayatollah Khamenei.
0.0	0.587101327847	Remember, we have 645 federal agencies and sub-agencies.
0.0	0.412739790947	That is the fight we have to have, and we have to undo a whole set of things that President Obama has done that get at the heart of his disrespect and disregard for too many Americans.
0.0	0.584991642618	The simple fact is that the plane that's being build here is being sold to China.
0.0	0.239698164902	We hear actually a lot of good intentions.
0.0	0.444991566171	I've a bill to fix Social Security.
0.0	0.429769557328	Here's -- apart from the -- apart from the higher prices on consumers and people are living paycheck to paycheck, apart from that, there will be retaliation.
0.0	0.282863326788	I think Americans want someone to have a track record of showing them how to get this country back on record, someone who will stand up and every day project that best days of America are in front of us.
0.0	0.347558670008	I will run on my record all day long.
1.0	0.629737647207	And, that's with zero percent interest rates.
0.0	0.227198045401	That is...
0.0	0.285821536105	No, I oppose it because you're taking money from the entitlement and then spending it immediately on other items.
0.0	0.444424767987	It's their money.
0.0	0.522322377418	Putting Iranian troops right on the border of the Golan right next to Israel would be a nonstarter for me.
0.0	0.40420848724	And you combine that with reforms of our welfare system.
0.0	0.203149041189	And let me be clear.
0.0	0.5	But the average person takes out about $350,000.
0.0	0.489301982191	We can't afford another four years of that.
0.0	0.281728295362	But I think a pause on Syrian refugees has been exactly right for all the governors that have called for it, and also, of course, for me as the governor of Ohio.
0.0	0.374424124754	It appears that the same someone who has been whispering in old Marco's ear too.
1.0	0.469245474145	In the past he has called him weak.
0.0	0.935304474385	92 percent -- 92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama's first term belonged to women.
0.0	0.0634451825986	So you know what needs to happen, it's a very simple equation, and it's going to happen when I'm president.
0.0	0.0660364501385	For too long -- no, for too long, what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our people's jobs, and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us.
0.0	0.4244158497	So I have nothing at all critical of him.
0.0	0.585984205604	It will lead to even greater war in this world.
0.0	0.301726443617	If you get caught abusing this program, you should never be able to use it again.
0.0	0.344090798138	We're going to have too many people in the cart rather than pulling the cart.
0.0	0.112520380358	The entire system of legal immigration must now be reexamined for security first and foremost, with an eye on ISIS.
0.0	0.236783411644	And let me tell you, ISIS and terrorists do not get their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.629685146213	I'm also going to take a bottle of White-Out with me to get started on all those executive orders that Mr. Obama has put his name to.
0.0	0.664049555122	I think it is fair to say, whatever the complaints that you want to make about him are, that with respect to China, one of the most challenging relationships we have, his opening up China and his ongoing relationships with the leaders of China is an incredibly useful relationship for the United States of America.
0.0	0.266801261149	We need a doer, not a talker.
0.0	0.170266115791	Let's quit blaming the people on Social Security.
0.0	0.131629833158	It will never happen because they'll let their currency go up.
0.0	0.441426412075	So, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities.
0.0	0.0925926967508	We need to break the Washington cartel, and the only way to do it is to end all the subsidies and all...
0.0	0.255132705604	Let me be clear.
0.0	0.332408040318	The wages that high school graduates receive today are significantly less, whether you are white or black, than they used to be.
0.0	0.482542675186	There is no money in the Medicare account.
0.0	0.583536284624	I've heard a lot of hot rhetoric here tonight, but I've got to tell you, as somebody that actually passed a budget; that paid down a half-a-trillion dollars of our national debt, you can't do it alone.
0.0	0.278591969483	Check it out.
0.0	0.461938261784	Well, as you know, I'm a former elected prosecutor, a former elected attorney general, trained at the University of Virginia in constitutional law, and I don't believe in litmus tests except this.
0.0	0.343513267596	In my view healthcare is a right of all people, not a privilege, and I will fight for that.
0.0	0.142528409303	Play by the rules.
0.0	0.658064501155	One principle, for example, we've got to embrace is on immigration.
0.0	0.443203911406	And I think that the record of the governor of the last 14 years of the 12th largest economy in the world is just the medicine America is looking for.
0.0	0.308614051565	We hear a lot of good plans.
1.0	0.587576709368	It allows President Obama to borrow unlimited amounts of money.
0.0	0.440433015564	That is not consistent conservatism, that is political calculation.
0.0	0.706885114894	Well, that has not been a part of most of the proposals that I've seen.
0.0	0.407573551932	Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.303395786478	And why I am a staunch supporter of President Obama's principal accomplishment -- namely the Affordable Care Act -- is because I know how hard it was to get that done.
0.0	0.579372251941	Let me just say on taxes, how long have we been talking about tax reform in Washington, D.C.?
0.0	0.264064994849	I find -- I mean, it's just a very different, you know, historical perspective here.
0.0	0.646868725377	I particularly appreciate the proposal that Congressman Jim Clyburn has -- the 10-20-30 proposal -- to try to spend more federal dollars in communities with persistent generational poverty.
0.0	0.317162324092	What you saw was a parade of, "I'll give you this for free; I'll give you that for free."
0.0	0.135265275732	But we need to understand that American Muslims are on the front line of our defense.
0.0	0.280296519109	It is a real horror.
0.0	0.44129981566	If we don't stop them over there, they are coming here just as sure as I stand here in front of you.
0.0	0.52768198881	This is a guy who just believes that law enforcement are the bad guys.
0.0	0.262428404746	We're going to cut Medicare and Medicaid, federal aid to education to help you, because the government is so terrible.
0.0	0.193205281758	At least he's honest enough to call himself a socialist.
0.0	0.382395735682	Right now, you don't have the -- you have taxes that are too high.
1.0	0.425095750013	They were wrong.
0.0	0.228396974084	Now, let me just be clear, John.
0.0	0.123441425083	But the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with Iran, maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world, yes, that is something I want to achieve.
0.0	0.152032702897	But it doesn't change my view that we need to empower everyone, women and men, to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make.
0.0	0.452890945344	Now, since September, the Constitution hasn't changed.
0.0	0.458012286827	I did a couple of speeches for them, I do speeches for other people.
0.0	0.121037741782	The truth is this, the big problem, we need a leader in Washington who understands how to get something done, not to talk about it, not to propose it, to get it done.
0.0	0.765930562374	I've got five grandkids.
0.0	0.164654919409	The millionaires and billionaires are doing great under Obama.
0.0	0.5	In fact, I was all for you until you started doing that, because that's a misrepresentation, number one.
0.0	0.135857040877	There are many lawyers.
0.0	0.422810407	Our best days are in front of us.
0.0	0.435384471097	It was a company that had grown into a bloated, inept bureaucracy that cost too much and delivered too little to customers and shareholders.
0.0	0.534340246422	Marco stood with Chuck Schumer and Barack Obama on amnesty.
0.0	0.306518567867	You think about the regulatory cost and the tax cost -- that's why small businesses are closing, rather than being formed in our country right now.
0.0	0.367526011605	We have to stand with them.
0.0	0.121461447725	Carl said, "no, no -- " but he's somebody -- these are the kind of people that we should use to negotiate and not the China people that we have who are political hacks who don't know what they're doing and we have problems like this.
0.0	0.479077156495	Here's my promise, at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country.
0.0	0.231318865698	When I am president, I will work consistently every single day to keep this country safe, not call Edward Snowden, as you did, a great public servant.
0.0	0.231748564826	Let me -- let me answer your question on the Sun-Sentinel editorial today.
0.0	0.2442941579	I am convinced because I see how he works with his attorney general, not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.444532398268	Let me (inaudible).
0.0	0.137252644588	Because, folks, at the end of the day, the country needs healed.
0.0	0.753914738031	One of your colleagues interviewed me.
0.0	0.368932052889	...is the lowest personal rate any candidate up here has, and what it would also enable us to do is for every citizen to fill out their taxes on a postcard so we can eliminate the IRS.
0.0	0.59630967114	The problem is we never get it done.
0.0	0.699310353957	We just, earlier this week, kicked them out of Medicaid in Louisiana as well, canceled their provider contract.
0.0	0.546325636174	The Democrats' answer to everything is more government control over wages, and more empowering trial lawyers to file lawsuits.
0.0	0.415752501464	The president's first impulse is do this by executive order, power he doesn't have.
1.0	0.626412613871	I never filed for bankruptcy.
0.0	0.45938186198	There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies.
0.0	0.381270418665	That's not true.
0.0	0.36592732466	Well, it's interesting.
0.0	0.645349270862	You're going to get it by paying your employees less and charging your customers more, that is a tax, the difference is, you don't see it on the bill.
0.0	0.84701288254	I have Ryan Tannehill, Marco, as my quarterback, he was 18 for 19 last week.
0.0	0.487937698282	Well, with respect to Syria, I really do appreciate the efforts that Secretary Kerry has made.
0.0	0.627665743777	She wouldn't just be a disaster, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being commander in chief of the United States.
0.0	0.558232318891	They pay tax once overseas.
0.0	0.228565524538	So you know what?
0.0	0.484011062009	I have been a strong ally with him on virtually every issue.
0.0	0.128306196932	You also have to get rid of all the deductions and all the loopholes.
0.0	0.846154460753	One, with respect to the Central American children, I made it very clear that those children needed to be processed appropriately, but we also had to send a message to families and communities in Central America not to send their children on this dangerous journey in the hands of smugglers.
0.0	0.150405915916	They hit us with a cyberattack simultaneously and dirty bombs.
0.0	0.372827501568	I am the only person in either campaign that's self-funding.
0.0	0.137087857596	You know, in recent travels around this country, I've encountered so many Americans who are discouraged and angry as they watch our freedom, our security and the American dream slipping away under an unresponsive government that is populated by bureaucrats and special interest groups.
0.0	0.330474010585	That is not right.
0.0	0.765623442345	We went after companies that were ripping off shareholders.
0.0	0.404543488327	Come with me to Iraq and Afghanistan, folks.
1.0	0.254448891435	Strong, powerful men, young and people are looking at that and they're saying what's going on?
0.0	0.0375173182983	I love the Chinese people but they laugh themselves, they can't believe how stupid the American leadership is.
0.0	0.305991833995	That was not, as I understand it, the secretary's position.
0.0	0.460030669397	My heart has not changed, because I've always been appalled by abortion.
0.0	0.251440691566	That's a dictatorship.
0.0	0.178641482367	I am all in favor of keeping these talented people here so they can go to work in Silicon Valley.
0.0	0.184317033829	I'm tired of the hyphenated Americans and the division.
0.0	0.542196081006	We had Boko Haram.
0.0	0.629945609591	But the best way to close this gap is to modernize higher education so Americans have the skills for those jobs.
0.0	0.889235602424	I would just say, I debated then Senator Obama numerous times on stages like this, and he was the recipient of the largest number of Wall Street donations of anybody running on the Democratic side ever.
0.0	0.304206120008	So when you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration -- which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother -- clearly, we are looking at institutional racism.
0.0	0.381111811827	But yes, there is more collaboration required between private sector companies and the public sector.
0.0	0.289045927066	So let's start by knowing where your money is being spent by the federal government.
0.0	0.443752419362	What happened with Atlantic City is very, very disgraceful.
0.0	0.207705669123	Yes, our allies are not perfect.
0.0	0.449648917078	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.443294752771	You can't have a question.
0.0	0.212002206588	It's the only way to level the playing field between big and powerful and small and powerless.
0.0	0.270362899126	Sometimes it's a complicated situation, but some things are black and white.
0.0	0.165809844146	I think the times are much more serious.
0.0	0.222689934236	So, I think gun-free zones are a catastrophe.
0.0	0.392451606642	And I do carry on occasion, sometimes a lot.
0.0	0.152410158174	Are you serious about this election?
1.0	0.96255399099	Six million more people living in poverty than the day that Barack Obama got elected president, and the left just wants more of the same.
0.0	0.588838435847	Atlantic City has gone bad.
0.0	0.434157644891	Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, they're no better.
0.0	0.5	So the answer is no and what Jeb said is absolutely correct.
0.0	0.444024116467	Let me conclude by just saying this.
0.0	0.480637555762	Today, we have a legal immigration system for permanent residency that is largely based on whether or not you have a relative living here.
0.0	0.119406377352	And, PBS, thank you.
0.0	0.403111310273	We need the lawyers(ph) off the back of the war fighters.
0.0	0.233419085031	I like it.
0.0	0.298691633391	And what distributes goods better?
0.0	0.448865586261	I will do so in a way that will bring people together.
0.0	0.373622944006	What we ought to do is tighten up our efforts to deal with the entry visa program so that a citizen from Europe, it's harder if they've been traveling to Syria or traveling to these other places where there is Islamic terrorism, make it harder -- make the screening take place.
0.0	0.704425532333	No Wall Street executive has been prosecuted.
0.0	0.291960567146	So as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and the like.
0.0	0.0819909572004	But I think to suggest that I have voiced criticism, this blurb that you talk about, you know what the blurb said?
0.0	0.298568125093	If they don't treat us fairly, hey, their whole trade is tariffed.
0.0	0.531856289765	That's was hard work.
0.0	0.45728465852	I actually have a plan.
0.0	0.64204794156	Every progressive economist who has analyzed that says that the numbers don't add up, and that's a promise that cannot be kept, and it's really important now that we are getting into the rest of the country that both of us are held to account for explaining what we are proposing because, especially with healthcare, this is not about math.
0.0	0.335681354929	Not armies massively marching on each other and air forces, but now we have dirty bombs and we have cyber attacks and we have people who will be attacking our electrical grid.

0.0	0.251751918467	OK?
0.0	0.244121269391	But I think they will see a very good option here.
0.0	0.658820160306	And the entire New York times attack -- is that I disclosed that loan on one filing with the United States Senate, that was a public filing.
1.0	0.437027959138	Very few children.
0.0	0.766062994065	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.300010561619	I don't think anybody has cut that much government anywhere, at any time.
0.0	0.584294787209	It's driving up stock prices.
0.0	0.562477550716	I've got a track record.
0.0	0.517466184944	I'm going to get a response to that, Neil.
0.0	0.457634246762	Karen and I have seven children.

0.0	0.0689720413076	Yes, I might feel more comfortable.
0.0	0.389309873836	I'm going to go to the commanders and say give me a plan to win.
0.0	0.203644798699	I believe in it but we have to be smart and we have to use smart people to negotiate.
0.0	0.108053079178	Well, let me just -- let me just say, once again...
0.0	0.451358252234	Well, it ain't Henry Kissinger.

0.0	0.399020158047	I propose to reverse that and get this economy moving again.
0.0	0.134778279564	America's at a crossroads.

0.0	0.522452925692	Maybe we would've gotten a deal where we didn't give everything away.
0.0	0.534825918852	Just for the record.
0.0	0.352667239856	Well, when you look at the celebrity of Donald Trump, then I think that says a lot about it.
0.0	0.0910989427092	Let me tell you, if we don't get this election right, there may be no turning back for America.
0.0	0.477989052377	This stuff is fantasy.
0.0	0.336106295679	And I'll tell you, it was heartbreaking.
0.0	0.75455276068	I believe this is still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.600827440312	We have been talking about it for decades.
0.0	0.179581457399	They're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.267694623438	And it has been a remarkable situation in our state.
0.0	0.0724663788541	We need to rebuild our military, and this president has let it diminish to a point where tinpot dictators like the mullahs in Iran are taking our Navy ships.
0.0	0.60424911373	We bailed them out.
1.0	0.356422452996	When I look at the migration, I looked at the line, I said it actually on your show recently, where are the women?
0.0	0.284469907535	We're going to have a big, fat beautiful door right in the middle of the wall.
0.0	0.150754873804	And that free education of extraordinary accomplishment was from first grade to 12th grade.
0.0	0.403251322246	It continues with regulatory reform.
0.0	0.0488999980363	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you had better get rid of the super PACs, because they're causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that are being made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.352532276634	I was ready to lead, but I wasn't ready to run.
0.0	0.174365819725	Well, if the law would change, yeah.
0.0	0.386288332293	They're a scam.
0.0	0.414514866278	I would do that to Barack Obama's executive orders.
0.0	0.230696263511	And we just got to make sure that every American has the tools, in K-through-12 and in vocational education, in higher education.
0.0	0.357758836187	So I know Secretary Kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease-fire up as quickly as possible.
0.0	0.433956274514	That is beyond unspeakable.
0.0	0.224070033593	We need to get realistic about this.
0.0	0.352064310222	If there was a -- and you know I'm not bringing a suit.
1.0	0.775089889528	And we'll save a trillion dollars over the next 10 years.
0.0	0.49026990221	But also the biggest people (ph) -- now I've used that to my advantage as a business man, for my family, for myself.
0.0	0.296031655255	You have to ban radical Islamic jihadists.
0.0	0.0633310361017	Where the secretary and I have a very profound difference, in the last debate -- and I believe in her book -- very good book, by the way -- in her book and in this last debate, she talked about getting the approval or the support or the mentoring of Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.621795047171	We have to lead a coalition that will take back territory from ISIS.
0.0	0.375286233229	I understand we can disagree on the path forward.
0.0	0.543320816191	Under my plan, no business, big or small, will pay more than 25 percent flat rate on their business income.
0.0	0.303739335593	The president of the United States admitting that he's weakening our government's position, our foreign policy standing, because he can't control spending in D.C..
0.0	0.361633466243	Maria, let me clear something up here.
0.0	0.370064666538	No, it's your record.
0.0	0.515175549306	Now, the challenge we're seeing today is that the Supreme Court is being converted into some type of political body.
0.0	0.647203843552	And that's why this study, which shows that if you can believe it today, for white working class people between 45 and 54, life expectancy is actually going down.
0.0	0.577158806581	You have got to pick somebody who has experience, somebody that has the know-how, the discipline.
0.0	0.558896564732	You've got to bring people together.
0.0	0.14271342283	So what we do, though, is, if there is somebody who is price- gouging, we have laws for prosecutors to take that on.
0.0	0.394763018825	You know why three?
0.0	0.528027702778	There's a reason the NRA gave me their Carter Knight Freedom Fund award...
0.0	0.227985149167	It could be people that are going to do great, great destruction.
0.0	0.339809389768	They're protectionist.
0.0	0.542326114475	And now they see Hillary Clinton proposing a third term of economic policy for our country.
0.0	0.351004996629	And, this is what I am finding throughout America.
0.0	0.111015780031	So if you happen to be right, you could get the top job at the end of the day.
0.0	0.171916760829	As we speak, there are new problems on the horizon.
0.0	0.283072139409	No, not at all, absolutely not.
0.0	0.595666984833	The simple fact is one of the ways, Maria, to solve the problem you described is narrow the number of people coming by family petitioning to what every other country has so that we have the best and the brightest that come to our country.
0.0	0.574289913656	John Harwood, there's a bigger issue here.
0.0	0.0187006258187	And -- and I just want to take this opportunity to say, you know, in the 2012 election, you know, we -- and when I say we, Republicans -- tore themselves apart.
0.0	0.0921645087504	But the issue for us is to have a Congress that stands up and says not only no, but "Hell no" to this money going to a regime that is going to use it for terror, Susan Rice has said that, and we need to stand up and strongly and clearly tell the ayatollah that -- whoever the next president of the United States is going to be, and I'll promise you, if it's me, the first thing that I will do is tear up that agreement with Iran.
0.0	0.772807361895	Health savings accounts are something that we introduced.
0.0	0.412833392478	Our greatest days lie ahead if we are willing to do what it takes now.
0.0	0.879953625236	Yeah, we can create 13 million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure at a cost of a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.179506531461	But now as I travel the country, people say what I feel.
0.0	0.261423477801	We're going to suspend and repeal every executive order, every regulation that cost American jobs and is -- is -- is impacting our freedom.
0.0	0.101727683838	...Or, even some famous Colorado brownies.
0.0	0.821616847822	The most mistreated people.
0.0	0.58839137168	I have gone time and time again to take on the vested interests who would keep women's health care decisions the province of the government instead of women ourselves.
0.0	0.329750043412	If we do not know who you are, and we do not know why you are coming when I am president, you are not getting into the United States of America.
0.0	0.195499469563	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.426275420102	They go to Princeton.
0.0	0.489859490123	For 30 years this country has been baited with that.
0.0	0.44316655736	You don't have seven children and bring them into this world if you're not optimistic about the future of this country.
0.0	0.437533085518	You did.
0.0	0.433563087184	So it's not just the government -- the private sector companies, it's also our own government that needs to raise the level of our game.
0.0	0.347492458923	And we would still have governors like Scott Walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions.
0.0	0.562252442673	I changed that.
0.0	0.474797886243	You have a big lawsuit over your head while you're running.
0.0	0.161362180034	Well, first of all, thank you all for having us.
0.0	0.480555064677	Every election we talk about this.
0.0	0.137649860514	It's like a tariff, but here's the difference: if we impose a tariff, China responds.
0.0	0.211752307009	We have made it easier to do that, not harder.
0.0	0.129976035097	Let's quit making it a problem for them.
0.0	0.465166443762	No one is a socialist.
0.0	0.340100566039	We're going dark when it comes to detecting the next attack.
0.0	0.423668582596	You're simply not.
0.0	0.387606309788	I saw you on the Senate floor flip your vote on crop insurance because they told you it would help you in Iowa, and last week, we all saw you flip your vote on ethanol in Iowa for the same reason.
0.0	0.230192569765	But if you want someone who has a proven, effective leadership, that was a governor of a state, that transformed the culture there, elect me so I can fight for the American people and change the culture in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.329966251715	And as someone who's worn the uniform of the country, that's how we build our military back up.
0.0	0.216632700727	I have a slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially.
0.0	0.25563365327	You know, you had Herbert Hoover before that saying, no, we got to only worry about the deficit.
0.0	0.465976823341	You didn't see these kind of ideas being batted around, and being batted around in a way that's civil and smart and that's trying to help to inform the voter out there.
0.0	0.0980317973147	You ought to just be able to get over it, get used to it...
0.0	0.252804792379	Here's the truth.
0.0	0.779477111451	Well, first of all, this is an issue that's been debated now for 30 years.
0.0	0.398266797126	Because we work with the private sector to make solar energy affordable and available to businesses and individuals in our state.
0.0	0.220687664792	Illegal immigration is beyond belief.
0.0	0.461897117593	I never said that.
0.0	0.10345894375	I do not believe that we need to wholesale destroy every American citizen's privacy in order to go after those that we know are suspect or are -- are already a problem.
0.0	0.136284670996	Yes, in my view, the government of a democratic society has a moral responsibility to play a vital role in making sure all of our people have a decent standard of living.
0.0	0.805228864029	You just see the recent deal announced today or yesterday, more spending, more tax increasing, more regulation.
0.0	0.799905780723	Corporate inversion is one of the biggest problems we have.
0.0	0.5	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.387688201854	And the fact is it was wrong.
0.0	0.862569071451	Iran sanctions -- the Iran sanctions that brought them to the table, those are sanctions that we put in place when I was in the United States Senate, and a whole host of other things that put me in a position of saying, I not only have a great vision, but I can govern effectively in Washington.
0.0	0.365986699924	She was a great CEO.
0.0	0.355752371126	They didn't do that either.
0.0	0.392721301197	What I did in New York was bring people together, an overwhelmingly Democratic state.
0.0	0.30764790351	But the final thing I want to say about this is the following.
1.0	0.647112482314	I am tired of sending $300 billion overseas to buy oil from people who hate our guts.
0.0	0.668434509303	I'm going to keep making sure that everything I've done, everything that I stand for is going to be well known.
0.0	0.220478700715	And, folks, we will.
0.0	0.103583544711	They get -- they steal them.
0.0	0.453240085223	We lose with ISIS.
0.0	0.765602433941	The Republican Party is blessed to have 11 good candidates, (inaudible) 10 good candidates.
0.0	0.229602072297	As an outsider, I tackled H.P.
1.0	0.57494843014	They don't want to pay 35 percent tax on the way back.
0.0	0.332186946428	It enables us to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	0.37180996491	Because, first of all, you may rename the IRS but you are not going to abolishes the IRS, because there has to be some agency that's going to collect your vat tax.
0.0	0.507344093411	We can reform those entitlements, we can change that corporate tax code and lower it.
0.0	0.5	He is -- this president is undermining the constitutional basis of this government.
0.0	0.113704556252	And finally, on health care, why don't we start treating -- keep giving...
0.0	0.734602343116	I'm the only one on this stage that has a plan that would create jobs, cut taxes, balance the budget and can get it done because I'm realistic.
0.0	0.253249245789	We need somebody who can balance budgets, cut taxes...
0.0	0.174515514227	I want to take off from that point and argue the same thing.
0.0	0.348397341822	He said, "there's a chill wind blowing through law enforcement in this country."
0.0	0.226315516694	If somebody's already stolen money from you, are you going to give them more?
0.0	0.351645630826	She said the truth.
0.0	0.426167099678	Jeb Bush says we've got to be willing to lose the primary in order to win the general.
0.0	0.448478518166	Let the states do this.
0.0	0.308128338801	No.
0.0	0.832548553576	It's the reason why I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and led the fight to stop the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, because it was clear then, like it's clear now, that border security is national security.
0.0	0.292317276865	No, the new planes.
0.0	0.584448865969	At the end of the day, the legal issue is quite straightforward, but I would note that the birther theories that Donald has been relying on -- some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on U.S. soil, but have two parents born on U.S. soil.
0.0	0.43278537697	No criminal records for them.
0.0	0.383404266722	Obamacare, we're going to repeal it and replace it.
0.0	0.533760333031	The world has changed.
0.0	0.0896553276101	I think America can only live up to its potential when we make sure that every American has a chance to live up to his or her potential.
1.0	0.646458060841	We pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.
0.0	0.354024105915	We're running.
0.0	0.44171142907	I have fought my entire life to make sure that healthcare is a right for all people.
0.0	0.0927228538564	...No, sir...
0.0	0.211130316613	How do I know this?
0.0	0.380531982006	There is a better way to provide health care.
0.0	0.489686072962	We had Hezbollah.
0.0	0.471726347615	Are you fed up with how Washington wastes your money?
0.0	0.323282425793	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.8744169627	I just read today in the New York Times, $250,000 for a 30 second ad.
0.0	0.281870462316	That has not been...
0.0	0.411484975807	It has to be dealt with.
0.0	0.417896274703	You know, when you go into the store and buy a box of laundry detergent, and the price has up -- you know, 50 cents because of regulations, a poor person notices that.
0.0	0.344208318186	I think the American people are look for real leadership.
0.0	0.418233640183	That's the truth of the matter and you see it every time with this president.
0.0	0.806418562003	They attacked us in San Bernardino two weeks ago.
0.0	0.150486486298	... and I'll tell you why.
0.0	0.809091900009	Secretary Clinton has been going around the country saying Bernie Sanders wants to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, people are going to lose their MedicAid, they're going to lose their CHIP program.
0.0	0.624856183362	This president every chance he has ever gotten has tried to undermine the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.453390222895	They can solve the problem of North Korea if they wanted to but they taunt us.
0.0	0.748203045882	You got Kuwait and you got Qatar and you got Saudi Arabia.
0.0	0.42554476715	We are not France.
0.0	0.264943561442	And it creates a -- a contempt for the law, for the rule of law.
0.0	0.412464720352	I just want to remind you, people paid their money.
0.0	0.609168891537	Have been ever since I was in the Senate.
0.0	0.812993841779	Washington gets bigger, taxes get higher, and the American people feel more distance from our government.
0.0	0.598800824429	Last week, Secretary Carter announced that the Navy's going to be cut again.
0.0	0.153106820196	But...
0.0	0.357131573951	I believe we should be appointing Supreme Court justices who will follow the law and not try to make the law.
0.0	0.447235589288	And frankly, it just came out, and in Iowa now, as you know, Ted, in the last three polls, I'm beating you.
0.0	0.401615857371	They believe some are smarter than others, some are better than others, so some are going to need to take care of others.
0.0	0.273498350553	And what is that proposal?
0.0	0.573733245405	They do celebrate more dependence on the government.
0.0	0.335226887203	Stimulating the economy -- because it's tethered down right now with so many regulations...
0.0	0.397694851209	They get them on the black market.
0.0	0.732290541068	It's a 20 percent flat rate tax, it'll take a blowtorch to the -- to the IRS.
0.0	0.84448484337	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.5	They do not get any credit for their care-taking responsibilities.
0.0	0.613215417651	There's a reason Gun Owners of America has endorsed me in this race.
0.0	0.64701987374	We have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone.
0.0	0.72830559053	I have a concrete plan to do just that, which allows people to keep HSAs to encourage savings, it allows for people that are retiring with Social Security to be able to get a minimum of 125 percent of the poverty level so that there is a baseline that in this generous country of ours no one goes below.
0.0	0.564044449217	Neil, my name was mentioned as well.

0.0	0.166044860037	But you know, we don't want to put everybody in the same category.
0.0	0.263569257475	We've already got a great talker in the White House.
0.0	0.343698348462	I am convinced that this president, if he could get rid of the Second Amendment, he would.
0.0	0.319290989365	And you think about the reasons that we're having such difficulty right now with our job market.
0.0	0.483772820626	It will cause the economy to grow, to explode, to create more jobs.
0.0	0.0253723166733	You know I understand why Donald made the comments he did and I understand why Americans are feeling frustrated and scared and angry when we have a president who refuses to acknowledge the threat we face and even worse, who acts as an apologist for radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.0833278533309	I am a conservative; I can win this job, I can do this job, I need your help, I need your support.
0.0	0.243372929836	If I'm president, there won't be stupid deals anymore.
0.0	0.229940014812	Nevertheless, one of the things that I think people don't always understand is how accountable a CEO actually is.
0.0	0.319377723347	And, we said no.
0.0	0.23646516068	We need to be very well aware of the fact that China and Russia are using technology to attack us, just as ISIS is using technology to recruit those who would murder American citizens.
0.0	0.137786782745	And to expand on Mr. Carson's -- or Dr. Carson's question, let's face it, we have laws already.
0.0	0.369500231599	I think we have achieved a great deal with the Iranian nuclear agreement to put a lid on the Iranian nuclear weapons program.
0.0	0.608780323366	A lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.44094501808	Folks, we have a problem here with the leadership in Washington, but I'll tell you another problem.
0.0	0.5	Let me give you one quick example.
0.0	0.293017108939	That's the side we need to be on, and that's the side of the bulk of the -- of the Middle East.
0.0	0.610846364264	Have you ever disagreed with a president?
0.0	0.119777997184	And, yes, people we may disagree with on a number of things may have some insight, may have some relationships that are important for the president to understand in order to best protect the United States.
0.0	0.362017074801	Why don't we just give a chicken in every pot, while we're, you know, coming up -- coming up with these fantasy tax schemes.
0.0	0.245527094022	We're going to end up in the same place.
0.0	0.461897117593	I never said that.
0.0	0.406679604977	We have to continue to work with the Iraqi army so that they are better prepared to advance on some of the other strongholds inside Iraq, like Mosul, when they are able to do so.
0.0	0.173279217456	That's why I ask for your support for president.
0.0	0.331663408626	Well, I don't know if it's a blind trust if Ivanka, Don and Eric run it.
0.0	0.54500659254	And the people who are getting hammered are small businesses, it's single moms, it's Hispanics.
0.0	0.0219074192235	They want a political revolution in which millions of Americans stand up, come together, not let the Trumps of the world divide us, and say, you know what, in this great country, we need a government that represents all of us, not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.
0.0	0.411872715441	Anybody who tells me that we need every penny and every one of those is in a fantasy world.
0.0	0.424945123677	It turns out some dot wasn't connected, and so the first thing we have to do is make sure that everyone and every responsible agency is attuned to all of these possibilities and symptoms.
0.0	0.465526074003	It's easier to talk to your friends.
0.0	0.642172023463	Well, this is one of the reasons why Tom Perkins and I had disagreements in the boardroom, Becky.
0.0	0.238161498023	And, then we have to go after sentencing, and that's one of the problems here in Wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn't happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level.
0.0	0.369380824671	So, are we going to ban Muslims from India, from Indonesia, from countries that are strong allies -- that we need to build better relationships with?
0.0	0.510820724764	We're going to bring jobs and manufacturing back.
0.0	0.243755420209	They know that this country is pushing the middle class, the hardworking taxpayers, backwards, and they saw a president who doesn't understand their pain, and doesn't have any plan for getting away from it.
0.0	0.248690479054	Now, what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next.
0.0	0.483744452571	We have to put the personnel on that border in the right places; you have to put the strategic fencing in place; and you have to have aviation assets that fly all the way from Tijuana to El Paso to Brownsville, Texas -- 1,933 miles looking down 24/7, with the technology to be able to identify what individuals are doing, and ID when they are in obviously illegal activities or suspicious activities, and quick response teams come.
0.0	0.295400877078	No, I said, " I would use -- " they were asking me what to do about North Korea.
0.0	0.724295637602	I don't think the founders put the Second Amendment as number two by accident.
0.0	0.531551307997	Those jobs, in many cases, are now gone.
0.0	0.187233785514	It needs to be repealed and replaced.
0.0	0.341725994608	They will -- some will follow.
0.0	0.106540642732	The number of women --
0.0	0.171339828056	So what if mass unemployment exists?
0.0	0.334530981353	Neil, my name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.339750658675	What we have got to do is make it clear that any police officer who breaks the law will, in fact, be held accountable.
0.0	0.0260826105413	But let's be clear: Russia's aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO -- correctly, I believe -- are saying, you know what, we're going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action.
0.0	0.0186041225604	Well, let's just -- let's just follow up on this, because, you know, I've made it very clear that no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail, and because of Dodd-Frank, we now have in law a process that the president, the Federal Reserve, and others can use if any bank poses a systemic risk.
0.0	0.277790451902	So yeah, someone who makes more money...
0.0	0.589425624314	It increases the per child tax credit, because I didn't read about this in a book.
0.0	0.572184415521	If we're willing to do what it takes now, the 21st century is going to be the new American century, greater than any other era we've had in the history of this great nation.
0.0	0.289010217032	We could do a whole show on that.
0.0	0.0613465541859	I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators -- back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.
0.0	0.33236297244	Now I think an area in kind of a vague way, or not so vague, where Secretary Clinton and I disagree is the area of regime change.
0.0	0.224181313869	And then in addition to that, the American people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.285317369953	...I'm going to go to Washington to stop it...
0.0	0.5	He just writes out an order, executive order.
0.0	0.342929534458	But I recall when Secretary Clinton ran against then-Senator Obama, she was critical of him for suggesting that maybe you want to talk to Iran, that you want to talk to our enemies.
0.0	0.39707340649	Just tell them that, you put people in there, we're going to bomb them.
0.0	0.317981536296	And God bless America.
0.0	0.0647266266474	And that is what's so critical for our neighborhoods, our families, our children, and our grandchildren.
0.0	0.140591292079	...eliminates the business...
0.0	0.251585464322	You know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money.
0.0	0.246437204106	But I would add this.
0.0	0.602544132009	The final observation, invoked Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.558957796482	It was a terrible sight.
0.0	0.743010480315	We're borrowing a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.463659860882	I would give up some Social Security to save a system that Americans are going to depend on now and in the future.
0.0	0.203602484412	But I want to start by helping those people who are most at risk, the ones who, yes, are cutting their pills in half, who don't believe they can make the rent, who are worried about what comes next for them.
0.0	0.370332033167	Of course not.
0.0	0.241747594609	Good luck making something out of this mess."
0.0	0.731480393088	King Abdullah of Jordan, a man I've known for a long time, has been asking for bombs and materiel.
0.0	0.336495044698	I will not do that.
0.0	0.928627107831	There were four dissenters, and they said that they believe the Second Amendment protects no individual right to keep and bear arms whatsoever, which means, if their view prevailed and the next president's going to get one, two, three, maybe four Supreme Court justices, the court will rule that not a single person in this room has any right under the Second Amendment and the government could confiscate your guns.
0.0	0.404193746121	Reforms, everything from moral and cultural issues to economic issues.
0.0	0.522733852141	And I have the feeling you're going to find a lot of cost overruns there and a lot of waste and duplicative activities.
0.0	0.205349498492	Thank you all very much.
0.0	0.723365936015	The fact is that this Justice Department under this president has been a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.479153177394	They don't like somebody else like David Petraeus, they prosecute them and send a decorated general on to disgrace.
0.0	0.417156498923	And this is not an endeavor that rewards that.
0.0	0.35917874791	Now, who are the people who are hurt by that?
1.0	0.329853592561	That's wrong.
0.0	0.485720754063	It's not fair trade.
0.0	0.406180299552	I mean, that's just the bottom line.
0.0	0.111726240354	But also, I can't fake anger.
0.0	0.393779549896	So I believe that working with Europe -- and, by the way, you know, we've got some very wealthy countries there in that part of the world.
0.0	0.612117036385	Folks, the government has no business stealing even more from the people who have paid this in.
0.0	0.406870180827	You target the bad guys.
0.0	0.560661255754	We elected a president that is weakening America on the global stage.
0.0	0.23003365059	We need to have some coalitions in that part of the world to go after ISIS, but we also need to send a clear message.
0.0	0.308128338801	No.
0.0	0.729414533229	So he had to leave the Situation Room after hearing from the small group advising him and he had to make that decision.
0.0	0.348075916708	There'll be people here that will talk about what they're going to do.
0.0	0.173519255417	There is a great deal of skepticism about the federal government.
0.0	0.716485317219	The rate -- the rate -- the rate is gonna be much closer to 15 percent.
0.0	0.582230030568	As we all remember, Senator Obama, when he ran against me, was against the war in Iraq.
0.0	0.554921501445	Everybody on this stage is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.585323215264	I didn't inherit any money.
0.0	0.269700298002	...income tax...
0.0	0.401708535925	And the idea that this negotiation -- I will tell you one thing.
0.0	0.631746454189	I changed it in New Jersey.
0.0	0.455989313342	But the good news is the next commander-in-chief is standing on this stage.
0.0	0.184422120661	I would begin by saying that I'm not sure it's a weakness, but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for America's future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people.
0.0	0.274795228883	I want to -- before my time runs out I want to get back to this issue of ISIS versus Iran.
0.0	0.169483418099	The economy was really booming.
0.0	0.485758332217	One of them being that if you don't have some agreement within the system from states and from families and from students, it's hard to get to where we need to go.
0.0	0.125701423117	They're devaluing their currency and they're killing our companies.
0.0	0.405187939285	That's what I said.
0.0	0.85783004494	Well, I was pleased that NATO announced just this week that they're going to start doing patrols in the Mediterranean, in the Aegean, to try to interdict the smugglers, to try to prevent the kind of tragedies that we have seen all too often, also to try to prevent more refugees from coming to the European Union.
0.0	0.591837642419	I had to answer every single question about every single result and every single projection in public until there were no more questions.
0.0	0.43416303549	The big Internet companies.
0.0	0.172610826099	And let's not let the secular progressives drive that out of us.
0.0	0.33712578134	In all due respect, Secretary Clinton, a lot of the progressive groups, the online groups have really asked you a simple question.
0.0	0.648079281068	That's why John McCain, even though he was born in Panama, was eligible to run for president.
0.0	0.379968412073	It is not a suggestion.
0.0	0.177632127017	Well, I think, Judy, what has to be appreciated is that, as a result of the disastrous and illegal behavior on Wall Street, millions of lives were hurt.
0.0	0.5	That's wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country.
0.0	0.740281648206	My father was born in Italy, and shortly after he was born my grandfather immigrated to this country.
0.0	0.210393389813	Again...
0.0	0.758362257769	As you know, he came to Vermont to campaign for me when he was a senator.
0.0	0.256223300476	You gotta be -- stick with it, and all that.
0.0	0.384296368203	I'm going to do what it takes to defend this nation.
0.0	0.149720673805	I mean, I ask that with all due respect.
0.0	0.190658558531	And what we want to do is to control this.
0.0	0.278925667624	I want a government so small I can barely see it.
0.0	0.311043021823	We cannot be the world's policeman.
1.0	0.519691026658	What Hillary Clinton's going to say, and has said before is, she wants to raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.228123009025	We need to make sure that people understand, as Jeb said before, that if you've done extraordinarily well in this country, do you want them to take more out of your taxes now and think they're gonna give it back to you later?
0.0	0.168411661636	...John...
0.0	0.242121075203	And I said, "well, if he wanted to play a song, maybe he could play, 'New York, New York'?"
0.0	0.220967230819	The people that Washington leaves behind.
0.0	0.33620053937	I've laid out...
0.0	0.268646365714	...incentives for people to keep people healthy, rather than giving the incentives to treat them when they're sick?
0.0	0.133028170034	You gotta be creative and imaginative.
0.0	0.292870022833	But Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term, and you should be showing up to work.
0.0	0.615770629141	If even in Paris, if they had guns on the other side, going in the opposite direction, you wouldn't have 130 people plus dead.
0.0	0.629407400217	No one here is under FBI investigation.
0.0	0.259568005853	I would sign an executive order protecting religious liberty, our first amendment rights, so Christian business owners and individuals don't face discrimination for having a traditional view of marriage.
0.0	0.276700504004	Of course, they would.
0.0	0.354308020166	People are upset about it.
0.0	0.472533894344	(BELL RINGS) ... and there's a reason, when Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer came after our right to keep and bear arms, that I led the opposition, along with millions of Americans -- we defeated that gun control legislation.
0.0	0.544196565804	Watching this broadcast tonight are millions of people that are living paycheck to paycheck.
0.0	0.0768840886274	And when we -- and when we do that, we don't do what the Republicans want, which is to cut Social Security.
0.0	0.5	You know, Obama has presented the American people with a false choice every time.
1.0	0.566910803663	We stuck to the fact that Americans are tired of Washington corporate interests and Democrats who are interested in just politics and power and they're looking for someone who's going to fight for them; looking for someone who's going to grow manufacturing sector of our economy, so those 74 percent of Americans who don't have a college degree have a chance to rise again.

0.0	0.355257720157	As you too know, I know I built a very great company.
0.0	0.173026593542	Hey look, he never had a chance.
0.0	0.0886830886557	As far as Mark is concerned, as far as the visas are concerned, if we need people, they have -- it's fine.
0.0	0.354105069338	And it troubles me that people are rewarded for tearing down our country.
0.0	0.249753601951	MACCALLUM: Thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.752458625941	That is the way we deal with global warming, climate change, or any of those problems, not through government intervention, not through government taxes, and for God's sake, don't send Washington another dime until they stop wasting the money they're already sending there.
0.0	0.591117786012	I'm going to prioritize those recipients who need the most help first.
0.0	0.42499976957	I think the last eight years in the private sector have allowed me to see government from the outside, and I think that is a positive thing.
0.0	0.345409419866	How can you run for the Republican nomination and be for single- payer health care?
0.0	0.0572496997023	My plan would sweep all of them into a regulatory framework so we can try to get ahead of what the next problems might be.
0.0	0.355609941739	I do.
0.0	0.106082588224	I want to reverse that decline.
0.0	0.490555062748	We need a ground force in Iraq and Syria, and America has to be part of that ground force.
0.0	0.23374828411	And I'll tell you what a weakness is of this country: there are a lot of people who are sick and tired because Washington does not play by the same rules that the American people have to play by.
0.0	0.509330517154	We're not going to solve this problem with traditional politics.
0.0	0.116195236759	They need to learn English, adopt our values, roll up their sleeves and get to work.
0.0	0.393801389904	That is important.

0.0	0.419477503323	We can do a wall.

1.0	0.728486375312	Becky, if you want a 10 percent flat tax where the numbers add up, I rolled out my tax plan today, you can find it on line at tedcruz.org.
0.0	0.313114652745	Well, I'm glad you asked that, Maria.
0.0	0.252108005695	And when you have insider information, which apparently has been the case, where people use that information and use big data to try to take advantage of it, there has to be some regulation.

0.0	0.276939131898	You're welcome.
0.0	0.411257186116	And on this issue of the Medicare in particular, it's important because they're going to demagogue what we're saying here tonight.
0.0	0.21937520135	In her world, cap- and-trade would dominate, that we will destroy the economy in the name of helping the environment.
0.0	0.104199070603	You can call it visas, you can call it work permits, you can call it anything you want.
0.0	0.283805195001	My dad was a bartender, my mother was a maid.
0.0	0.318392383894	The president has done an executive order with respect to illegal immigration that is illegal.
0.0	0.0496649790379	But it is absolutely fair and necessary for Americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average American family?
1.0	0.573540177942	Third, if you look at my record as governor of New Jersey, I have vetoed a 50-caliber rifle ban.
0.0	0.0485708663919	And -- and -- and the last piece of this, Maria, is this.
0.0	0.0377720058864	We need to control the border, we need to do all of this in a comprehensive way, not just going back and forth and talking about stuff --
0.0	0.204058837041	No, it speaks to the fact that I don't know those --
0.0	0.746031052485	But I was able to get Democrats to support the most conservative sweeping policy changes in any state in America.
0.0	0.494584021237	And this president, given what Ted said right at the beginning, he's absolutely right.
0.0	0.45669545692	I will be that new leader.

0.0	0.412200842498	Well, I did.
0.0	0.0465416594289	In my case, whether it's health care, or getting us to debt-free tuition, or moving us toward paid family leave, I have been very specific about where I would raise the money, how much it would cost, and how I would move this agenda forward.

0.0	0.538707901249	I think what our campaign is indicating is that the American people are tired of establishment politics, tired of establishment economics.
0.0	0.216402291622	And guess what, in 2011, I got a deal...

0.0	0.173098302928	With all the candidates, why me?
0.0	0.116564822814	So let's support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition.
0.0	0.857957647242	I have a proven record of success, 32 years in business, and 8 years as Governor of the state of Florida.

0.0	0.163797712949	...and be held accountable.
0.0	0.646699714654	You did support a U.N. Security Council approach, which we did follow up on.
0.0	0.409801628784	The fact is, there's a number of things that the next president is going to have to do to clean up this mess.

0.0	0.228582727216	I can agree with you or not, but you can't have a question over your head.
0.0	0.107548496784	Secondly, a policy on recruiting and hiring, and then more resources for -- for training.
0.0	0.471748483787	You lead and you produce results.

0.0	0.416639485665	Our waste water plants, our rail, our airports, in many places are disintegrating.
0.0	0.433466025104	He is a good man.
0.0	0.476759064175	But, the real issue, I think, that the Senator is injecting into this is that if you had a Super PAC, like President Obama has, which now says it wants to support me.
0.0	0.311503796202	But we are where we are right now.
0.0	0.422029254103	It's why you see the banks consolidating.
0.0	0.149635582239	And so much of what we did -- to force competition, to use technology, to stand down the special interest groups -- can you imagine taking Medicaid from 10 to 2.5 percent?
0.0	0.544643927593	We're up 347,000 jobs.
0.0	0.185761092496	But, by the way, when it comes to a woman having to make a very personal choice, ah, in that case, my Republican colleagues love the government and want the government to make that choice for every woman in America.
0.0	0.440974411135	I don't think they dropped all the amendments into a hat and picked them out of a hat.

0.0	0.240114133228	I have worked for his re-election.
0.0	0.513678309476	If you're worried about the world being on fire, you're worried about how we're going to use our military, you're worried about strengthening our military and you're worried most of all about keeping your homes and your families safe and secure, you cannot give Hillary Clinton a third term of Barack Obama's leadership.
0.0	0.42371766874	A terrible sight.
0.0	0.46575525477	We have to work with NATO to protect Eastern Europe against any kind of Russian aggression.
0.0	0.0306711282227	We need to elect someone who will stand with the American people, who understands its greatness, who understands what an open economy and freedom is all about, but at the same time, has a record of being able to get things done in Washington like we've never seen before.
0.0	0.39918324926	And sending that signal makes it impossible for us to be serious about taking out ISIS and restoring democracy in Syria.
0.0	0.186400197218	I think we should do both.
0.0	0.21702214397	Recognize that the caliphate is what gives them the legitimacy to go out on a jihadist mission, so we need to take that away from them.
0.0	0.168411661636	...Chris...
0.0	0.340073872303	Let me tell you what I would do immediately, day two in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.635813489235	I think it's great that Senator Sanders, President Obama and I have more donors than any three people who have every run, certainly on the Democratic side.
0.0	0.444624896014	Just a little bit.
0.0	0.292447401214	But they can't get along.
0.0	0.413137671936	But, now for millions of Americans, it's slipping away.
0.0	0.270931349982	If you elect me president of the United States, I will secure that southern border.
0.0	0.226823755987	They're a feeding frenzy for sick people.
0.0	0.386394768036	But those kinds of personal assessments and charges are ones that I find particularly troubling.
0.0	0.182355493568	The fact is in New Jersey, what we have done is to make it easier now to get a conceal and carry permit.
0.0	0.212640720249	And as president, I will rebuild the military and keep this country safe.
0.0	0.35662477625	And there's a bunch of things my tax plan does to help them.
0.0	0.104653934332	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.601980087161	Yes, the wealthiest people, the top 1.5 percent, will pay more in taxes.
0.0	0.36581742212	We're against your policies.
0.0	0.193492922561	These...
0.0	0.133410813406	That's just a fact, and that's what Donald Trump taps into.
0.0	0.52254610289	So if you're having Medicare for all, single-payer, you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing.
0.0	0.398089837474	We have gutted our ability to detect the next attack.
0.0	0.252852047491	Eleven points, to be exact.
0.0	0.179757849798	And you know what?
0.0	0.307613187998	I think there is constitutional and legal authority for the president to have done what he did.
0.0	0.376181722318	You're right.
0.0	0.282704204737	Appreciate it.
0.0	0.302886477691	That's what I've always stood for.
0.0	0.489016732788	I have studied that issue in great detail.
0.0	0.576857629437	It's never been that way in American politics before.
0.0	0.454804844179	And at the end of the day, it was the president's decision.
0.0	0.291343741951	That's the way it should be, and I'm going to continue to reach out to thank all my online contributors for everything they are doing for me, to encourage them and help me do more just as Senator Sanders is.
0.0	0.421355112995	They're off to China.
1.0	0.905696630633	I vetoed a statewide I.D. system for gun owners and I pardoned, six out-of-state folks who came through our state and were arrested for owning a gun legally in another state so they never have to face charges.
0.0	0.13168460054	Well, yes, indeed.
0.0	0.829381860296	These folks, CNBC, they had it down at three, three and a half hours.

0.0	0.183588004765	The last thing we need is to throw our country into a contentious debate about health care again.
0.0	0.320952370796	We need sound money.
0.0	0.687439454691	Not too many years ago, Donald did a long interview with Tim Russert.
0.0	0.794480561048	Now in terms of their really stunning hit piece, what they mentioned is when I was running for senate -- unlike Hillary Clinton, I don't have masses of money in the bank, hundreds of millions of dollars.
0.0	0.958505732928	Back in 2004, one of my predecessors to the Senate by the name of Bob Graham, a Democrat, ran for president missing over 30 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.647320659176	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.

0.0	0.130147373061	Right there, right next to the plant.
0.0	0.619426276004	Terrorism is on the run, China, Russia is advancing their agenda at warp speed, and we pull back.
0.0	0.160598417145	You will also have to means-test the benefits and declare there's not enough money.
0.0	0.391948354171	And where we are right now is we have got to stand up to the Trumps of the world who are trying to divide us up.
0.0	0.471894531487	Super PACs are a disaster.
0.0	0.250171195579	But I look at this country today, and I look at how divided we are, I look at how politicians are always posturing and issuing sound bites but never solving problems.
0.0	0.285894776992	Neil, the problem...
0.0	0.477769473933	He has gone to China.

0.0	0.459346946732	Not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.56313926257	That is the appropriate approach in order to get the results that you are seeking.
0.0	0.127736182544	And I want to just suggest to you.
0.0	0.660916563055	You can't get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year.
0.0	0.340885726214	People aren't dumb.
0.0	0.5	I went out and said, it's ridiculous.
0.0	0.483145963934	But guess who pushed for that regulation?

0.0	0.295734408087	I love Donald Trump.
0.0	0.627203086347	But this is what you're seeing in the Republican debate that you didn't see in that Democrat debate.
0.0	0.328912835903	How great is that?
0.0	0.341578726991	I will stand firm.
0.0	0.589011265146	It's like a 400 pound man saying, "I'm going to go on a diet, but I'm eating a sack of Krispy Kremes before I do."
0.0	0.31125202227	I just left Indonesia -- bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb.

0.0	0.308419368887	That is not what America should be about.
0.0	0.453374932669	They don't care about American workers, they just care about bringing as many people in so they can get as many votes as they can.
0.0	0.320874089816	Under -- under Barack Obama and the proposals of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and others, they've tried it their way, and it has failed miserably.
0.0	0.413808739015	Is there an area for a safety net?
0.0	0.175854131919	Take it from your professors...

0.0	0.359099161948	Thank you, senator.
0.0	0.269245460723	They have a sophisticated understanding of our legal immigration system and we now have an obligation to ensure that they are not able to use that system against us.
0.0	0.356032872055	The first one would be to my good friend, Bibi Netanyahu, to reassure him we will stand with the State of Israel.
0.0	0.359458667126	Alright.
0.0	0.458969385999	Because the damage he has done to America is extraordinary.

0.0	0.421510401936	Japan, the same thing.

0.0	0.163807709941	I'm a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.144974834016	We need someone with a steady hand being president of the United States.
0.0	0.19176821595	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.435188584108	But we stuck to our message.
0.0	0.546869122437	I would a whole lot rather had Carly Fiorina over there doing our negotiation than John Kerry.
0.0	0.107902972264	We know this for a fact.
0.0	0.251751918467	Yes.
0.0	0.21327592721	We have got to destroy their training camps over there before they can attack us here.

0.0	0.656709576153	Well, and specifically to Medicare, Becky, because 85 percent of the cost of Medicare is chronic disease.
0.0	0.332937161835	If this country that does not keep its promise to seniors then what promise can this country hope to be trusted to keep?
0.0	0.610200735428	If you do that, you don't just change the economy, you transform the lives of millions of hurting Americans.
0.0	0.345896831276	And for good cause.
0.0	0.333681392875	The better way of dealing with this -- the better way of dealing with this is recognizing that there are people in, you know, the -- Islamic terrorists inside, embedded in refugee populations.
1.0	0.954253335495	When President Obama came into office we were losing 800,000 jobs a month, 800,000 jobs a month.
0.0	0.352535195643	If we reengage and get involved, yeah, we can have health care for all people, we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.239585804842	He's penalized -- and doesn't understand.
0.0	0.313076215145	That's what I'm working towards.
0.0	0.563116308792	We used to win, we don't win anymore.
0.0	0.265427882285	Look, we have to stop with political correctness.
1.0	0.306632900338	And he says, the president's appointee, that crime is going up because of this.
1.0	0.653511120586	In Florida, we have the lowest in-state tuition of any state, because there's accountability, just as John said.
0.0	0.445186648574	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.715569380117	We have this enormous mismatch because we have smaller and smaller families.
0.0	0.238612771851	I don't think you expand entitlements when so many people are dependent on government and when the money the federal government is offering is going to be taken away from you after just a couple of years.
0.0	0.639921933682	For example, before you hire anyone from abroad, you should have to advertise that job for 180 days.
0.0	0.107709806275	Our country rise up again, but we need to have a compelling conservative agenda that we present to the American people in a way that doesn't disparage people, that unites us around our common purpose.
0.0	0.303863097344	That's who's in my mind
0.0	0.268332493286	Let me translate that for you.
0.0	0.423455645273	First and foremost, this issue has to be now more than anything else about keeping America safe.
0.0	0.459572660227	But let me just say that we also need down -- to tear down the cyber walls that China is erecting, that Russia is erecting.
0.0	0.261890495272	And unlike President Obama, where he refuses even to use the term of what's going on, he can't use the term for whatever reason.
0.0	0.274311142135	You've got to have a clear vision of where you want to go.
0.0	0.651044006029	Here is the one thing I'm not going to do.
0.0	0.441419625318	He has got -- that is why he is on the end.
0.0	0.294241369858	OK. You know, the Democrats who have the ultimate super PAC, it's called the mainstream media.
0.0	0.116611069884	This is extraordinary.
0.0	0.33422717957	Right.
0.0	0.396344466037	I have a feeling it's going to work out, actually.
0.0	0.42988169896	And recognizing that it's so important, this election, because we're talking about America for the people versus America for the government.
0.0	0.441851736975	And said, well, she said you were angry and I said to myself, huh, she's right.
0.0	0.30945235419	But this is nothing new.
0.0	0.161407219191	But if we elect the right person -- if you elect me -- we will turn this country around, we will reclaim the American dream and this nation will be stronger and greater than it has ever been.
0.0	0.460022110059	Our country doesn't win anymore.
0.0	0.106384049183	And, you know, we have a whole variety of things that they can do and they can do these things simultaneously.
0.0	0.212553481301	Now, Donald...
0.0	0.631698656218	We've laid out a national energy plan that says that we should invest in all types of energy.
0.0	0.152742923302	So we need new leadership -- yes.
0.0	0.530151984639	And with respect to the 2007 bill, this was Ted Kennedy's bill.
0.0	0.282704204737	Thank you.
0.0	0.640323305645	And it costs, with dynamic scoring, less than a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.431043188323	We're going to take the political handcuffs off the military.
0.0	0.619500795234	I've seen plenty of other people follow up?
0.0	0.680862195478	To talk about we're just gonna have a 10 percent tithe and that's how we're gonna fund the government?
0.0	0.316402588196	I like Marco Rubio.
0.0	0.0636893060169	This is about people's lives, and we should level with the American people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare.
0.0	0.678660828066	It's the same thing that I did in Ohio.
0.0	0.941268420545	Today congress decided to take another $150 billion dollars away from Social Security so they can borrow more money.
0.0	0.211401080537	And we need to do that throughout the country.
0.0	0.444068117037	But we have to restore policing that will actually protect the communities that police officers are sworn to protect.
0.0	0.583148942151	You know, I sat down with the senior leadership of John Deere.
0.0	0.236989533411	He has got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.143011461953	We have a -- they say there's no bipartisanship in Washington?
0.0	0.12551375638	And -- and -- and I -- you know, Ben is absolutely right in saying that what we don't need to do is to send more money to Washington, D.C. to fix this problem.
1.0	0.84448484337	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
1.0	0.716057491014	We have the highest rate of childhood poverty among almost any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.430826124396	In fact, it's the chief argument by democrats against many of the different flat tax proposals.
0.0	0.184828883646	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.161445677338	... his answer -- you name it.
0.0	0.23582857444	And what I have said is I will not throw us further into debt.
0.0	0.5	It's the strongest pro-worker immigration plan.
0.0	0.341865212085	We have got to make sure that local police departments look like the communities they serve in their diversity.
0.0	0.389531204673	I'm a fighter.
0.0	0.709312140565	I was an Army intelligence agent and a veteran during the Cold War, assigned to West Germany.
0.0	0.328722604665	You know, I know to a lot of people in the media, this is just a great big game, and we're the players.
0.0	0.439200585959	They're never going to let it happen.
0.0	0.547433787796	Well, first off, what we don't do is do what Hillary Clinton and John Kerry and Barack Obama want us to do, which is their solution for everything, put more taxes on it, give more money to Washington, D.C., and then they will fix it.
0.0	0.361212511839	Let's let a Justice Department -- and I will make an attorney general who will enforce the law and make justice more than just a word.
0.0	0.282704204737	Thank you.
0.0	0.404916670042	I will change the culture in Washington, just as I changed the culture in Tallahassee.
0.0	0.231969726329	That's essentially what we have now, and we don't need that.
0.0	0.455642745934	But getting back to Martha's question about how we end dependency, do we have to have a cultural change?
0.0	0.457475251562	And also, I've been tested in a way no one else has.
0.0	0.114978325643	Do we still have values and principles?
0.0	0.296821831957	I used the tithing analogy.
0.0	0.140045601829	Martha, religious liberty doesn't include encouraging a fellow American to engage in violent jihad and kill an American here.
0.0	0.248485105042	I've watched to see people say that we should dismantle Medicare and Medicaid and leave the senior citizens out -- out in the -- in the cold.
0.0	0.481000697047	It is time to believe in America again.

0.0	0.822149396137	Twenty-four months ago, 36 months ago, you did not have a group of radical crazies named ISIS who were burning people in cages and recruiting people to enter our country legally.
0.0	0.193385743308	Everybody's record's going to be scrutinized, and at the end of the day we need to unite behind the winner so we can defeat Hillary Clinton, because she is a disaster.

0.0	0.443710118345	Carl, are we really talking about getting government involved in fantasy football?

0.0	0.329368659215	But on this point, if I may add something on this point.
0.0	0.301442659422	Say again?
