0.0	0.334325957625	I'm totally open to a tariff.

1.0	0.467601797449	Think about it: six and a half million people working part-time.
0.0	0.197193728838	And the problem, Maria, is that the military is not ready, either.

0.0	0.49181915377	But it was not on a second filing with FDIC and yes, I made a paperwork error disclosing it on one piece of paper instead of the other.
0.0	0.172602450724	And when we -- and when we do that, we don't do what the Republicans want, which is to cut Social Security.
0.0	0.482378578491	It was 25 years ago, and I came by defeating the Democratic incumbent.

0.0	0.133453031376	And I would not stand for that as president of the United States.
0.0	0.39019197965	It is disgraceful, and in a Christie administration, they would know much, much better than to do that.
0.0	0.861304938821	And it's why I've continued to focus on the fact that we need to declare war on the four big cost drivers because 80 percent of all medical costs in this country are chronic disease.

0.0	0.392427316162	Well I want to comment on this.
0.0	0.0733889876282	But what he's touching -- talking about, I think has got merit.
0.0	0.881075061952	When I was running for senate just about every lobbyist, just about all of the establishment opposed me in the senate race in Texas and my opponent in that race was worth over 200 million dollars.
0.0	0.394422071894	This is the fantasy that I talked about in the beginning.
0.0	0.405095206595	That should be a right of all Americans regardless of the income of their families.
0.0	0.159036883954	You can't do it with empty promised.
0.0	0.532347066074	I have a debt to America I'll never repay.

0.0	0.198613468994	Well, first let me address the tax issue because it's related to the entitlement issue and I want to thank you for holding a substantive debates where we can have debates about these key issues on taxes.
0.0	0.345331539328	You have to have certainty.
0.0	0.217181915938	We lose with ISIS.
0.0	0.0301738495046	All of those things are important, and all those things would happen in a Christie administration.
0.0	0.242597954854	But I want to start by helping those people who are most at risk, the ones who, yes, are cutting their pills in half, who don't believe they can make the rent, who are worried about what comes next for them.
0.0	0.557267212459	Kissinger was one of those people during the Vietnam era who talked about the domino theory.
0.0	0.243594773217	But our goal is, in fact, to try over a period of time to, in fact, deal with our enemies, not just ignore that reality.
0.0	0.272881058997	And our adversaries continue to grow stronger.
0.0	0.798711018674	Planned Parenthood had better hope that Hillary Clinton wins this election, because I guarantee under President Jindal, January 2017, the Department of Justice and the IRS and everybody else that we can send from the federal government will be going in to Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.160120943272	We don't have to have refugees come to our country, but all Muslims, seriously?

0.0	0.0185760837708	We need to make the government run smarter and better, and reform this corporate tax system, bring that money back to the United States to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, and we need to use it also to protect our grid from terrorists.

0.0	0.18802485046	Because -- because Donald's mother was born in Scotland.
0.0	0.33655523144	I don't see a lot of weakness on this stage, quite frankly.

0.0	0.166147727782	It appears that the same someone who has been whispering in old Marco's ear too.
0.0	0.0937792540653	Next, we have to talk to our adversaries, and we have to make sure they understand the limits of our patience.
1.0	0.934120577599	Secondly, I never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
1.0	0.878677108561	You know, I left my medical practice and ran for office because I was concerned about an $18 trillion debt.
0.0	0.0553434296677	OK.
0.0	0.251279256655	Now it is their time to help the middle class.
0.0	0.373984251453	That's why John McCain, even though he was born in Panama, was eligible to run for president.
0.0	0.117809193765	They were wrong.
0.0	0.0535217784578	But what is to prevent a future liberal president or a liberal Congress from coming back and not just raising the income tax, but also raising that VAT tax, and that vat tax is really bad for seniors.
0.0	0.278314828855	But yes, there is more collaboration required between private sector companies and the public sector.
0.0	0.269349518436	And we don't need a weak person being president of the United State, OK?
0.0	0.580057014434	We got to do a lot about the high cost of high -- higher education, but we've got to make sure we're training people for jobs that exist, that are good jobs that can pay.
0.0	0.615523206746	We're a country of laws, Bill.
0.0	0.216112097503	Are you coming onboard a proposal?
0.0	0.186432675024	This is a great nation.
0.0	0.39773811545	When extraordinarily wealthy people make very large contributions to Super PACs, and in many cases in this campaign, Super PACs have raised more money than individual candidates have, OK?
0.0	0.453083109187	And I have to tell you, that was a very insulting statement that Ted made.
0.0	0.298086789801	Makes it a whole lot easier for them to want to go somewhere else.
0.0	0.227689214929	...Rand is exactly right.
0.0	0.263861998181	Obama broke every rule of negotiation.
0.0	0.131389876724	That is a bad deal and an evil situation, and presidents have looked the other way.
0.0	0.185502989478	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.153557181513	I didn't.
0.0	0.0973206312722	And I have many great Muslim friends.
0.0	0.643325428441	He wasn't my senator.
0.0	0.154032992468	And the fact is those jobs are critical, they're hard working members of the middle class and they need to be paid attention to because they're Americans and they carry the load.
0.0	0.859335107681	You're talking about $2.7 trillion.
0.0	0.249974232521	I was recruited to H.P.
1.0	0.0571338729951	We stuck to the fact that Americans are tired of Washington corporate interests and Democrats who are interested in just politics and power and they're looking for someone who's going to fight for them; looking for someone who's going to grow manufacturing sector of our economy, so those 74 percent of Americans who don't have a college degree have a chance to rise again.
0.0	0.533775848124	It is Iran that's the expansionist power.
0.0	0.410126524973	Yes, in my view, the government of a democratic society has a moral responsibility to play a vital role in making sure all of our people have a decent standard of living.
0.0	0.362202859933	But you haven't asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought I'd get that off my chest if you don't mind.
0.0	0.178943415907	And that problem is too big regulations like the EPA, too much new taxes on business that we have seen and "Obamacare."
0.0	0.0470992935655	And wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong.
0.0	0.173146500043	The agreement on humanitarian relief now needs to be implemented, because there are enclaves that are literally filled with starving people throughout Syria.
0.0	0.069554093338	What we ought to do is tighten up our efforts to deal with the entry visa program so that a citizen from Europe, it's harder if they've been traveling to Syria or traveling to these other places where there is Islamic terrorism, make it harder -- make the screening take place.
0.0	0.178774769016	Well, I want to know, did you win?
0.0	0.286664054664	Not all of his top national security advisors agreed with that.
0.0	0.305724246858	That's where crime is happening in these cities where they don't enforce the immigration laws.
0.0	0.187711200784	I talked about Donald Trump from the standpoint of being an individual who was using his celebrity rather than his conservatism.
0.0	0.338576197015	The big Internet companies.
0.0	0.363108656658	Simply expanding Medicaid does not improve health care outcomes.
0.0	0.188922701334	Absolutely.
0.0	0.5	Because this president has consistently underestimated the threat of ISIS.
0.0	0.101897262345	...before I go.
0.0	0.0923001823367	I know how to do that.
0.0	0.676285837183	In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense.
1.0	0.50595502784	The bad news is, we have 470,000 going out of business every year.
0.0	0.291816112767	I congratulate Secretary of State John Kerry and the president for working on this agreement.
0.0	0.128185580419	So count me in as somebody who will not be listening to Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.221268520908	If my memory is correct, I think when we saw children coming from these horrendous, horrendously violent areas of Honduras and neighboring countries, people who are fleeing drug violence and cartel violence, I thought it was a good idea to allow those children to stay in this country.
0.0	0.169643123532	Well, I would begin by reminding people that at this point in previous presidential elections, Jimmy Carter couldn't win, Ronald Reagan couldn't win, Bill Clinton couldn't win, and neither could've Barack Obama.
0.0	0.364654754653	There are a lot of people living paycheck to paycheck in Florida as well, they're looking for a senator that will fight for them each and every day.
0.0	0.640806842359	and they decide, we're going to raise it to 30 percent, plus we're going to raise the income tax to 30 percent.
0.0	0.144960522879	They have infrastructure.
0.0	0.309988734557	And as someone who's worn the uniform of the country, that's how we build our military back up.
0.0	0.144416949432	When I was in Washington, I fought to get the budget balanced.
0.0	0.113024269374	And where we are right now is we have got to stand up to the Trumps of the world who are trying to divide us up.
0.0	0.166274789971	That's not even an issue.
0.0	0.168046896389	I had to answer every single question about every single result and every single projection in public until there were no more questions.
0.0	0.555679518838	Effectively it is day trading without any regulation at all.
0.0	0.311524027462	Look, in addition to what Donald was saying is we also need to talk about the legal immigration system for permanent residents.
0.0	0.797850468546	In the first day in office, my first executive order, I revoked every one of the executive orders that he had -- he had enacted over the prior 12 years.
0.0	0.350428912075	We do not have to have massive levels of income and wealth inequality.
0.0	0.285980483936	I have studied that issue in great detail.
0.0	0.136343932521	The domino theory, you know, if Vietnam goes, China, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.
0.0	0.572914757249	So I not only had the opportunity to go through the Cold War struggles in Central America, and even after 9/11 to be involved.
0.0	0.303105620023	That's why I'm running for office because when I become president of the United States, on my first day in office we are going to repeal every single one of his unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.843478327454	I voted against it because the Southern Poverty Law Center, among other groups, said that the guest-worker programs that were embedded in this agreement were akin to slavery.
0.0	0.0823052740693	And if we try to put everybody in the same -- call everybody the same thing, we can't do it.
0.0	0.408490875625	I can only say that we both share the goal of universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.54056308508	You know, I listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas.
0.0	0.379002680059	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.352459923901	It's called the mainstream media who every single day...
0.0	0.367361950059	Why didn't they call the police?
0.0	0.740916567669	It's the reason why I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and led the fight to stop the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, because it was clear then, like it's clear now, that border security is national security.
0.0	0.222637306467	We've all been talking about tax reforms tonight, and paying for infrastructure is caught right up in tax reform.
0.0	0.144380148271	I would a whole lot rather had Carly Fiorina over there doing our negotiation than John Kerry.
0.0	0.733728766738	I'm putting up 100 percent of my own money.
0.0	0.234757874612	I don't think anybody should expand Medicaid.
0.0	0.205551873885	You see what the Saudi's -- deliver them a strong message but at the end of the day we have to keep our cool because most of the time they're going right with us.
0.0	0.047549325673	I think what President Obama did was to exemplify the importance of this issue as our first African American president, and to address it both from the President's office, and through his advocacy, such as working with young men, and Mrs. Obama's work with young women.
0.0	0.187322101925	Maria, I assume that I can respond to that.
0.0	0.188381720324	And, PBS, thank you.
0.0	0.382257130637	We will invest in education, and jobs for our kids, not incarceration and more jails.
0.0	0.327882865353	Every progressive economist who has analyzed that says that the numbers don't add up, and that's a promise that cannot be kept, and it's really important now that we are getting into the rest of the country that both of us are held to account for explaining what we are proposing because, especially with healthcare, this is not about math.
0.0	0.136397619129	Instead, the Washington establishment raised both.
0.0	0.247904819193	It is.
0.0	0.036879333117	Neil...
0.0	0.38257827227	Get over that one, OK?
0.0	0.15309292351	All we need to do is protect them, they will be in their own country.
0.0	0.251888746962	...incentives for people to keep people healthy, rather than giving the incentives to treat them when they're sick?
0.0	0.566850561491	It's always a solution of the left to create more Government from the Federal Government.
0.0	0.176175461264	I will be the Ronald Reagan if I can find a Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.235443504075	Absolutely, because what we will do is say, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so they're not hanging out on street corners.
0.0	0.833167179766	We're reducing taxes to 15 percent.
0.0	0.364330115963	If an American missionary has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.380058778894	The age will have to gradually rise, there is no question.
0.0	0.252401047852	But I feel that the gun-free zones and, you know, when you say that, that's target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill. That's target.
0.0	0.24308507586	And it troubles me that people are rewarded for tearing down our country.
0.0	0.189082814712	But as Bill said earlier, Roe v. Wade, it's has been the law for 42 years, and I don't think we should continue to try to change it.
0.0	0.547691272121	And for the sake of me, I can't figure out which one is which.
0.0	0.639658735464	It will lead to even greater war in this world.
0.0	0.785466716449	Why are there five even bigger Wall Street banks now, instead of the ten we used to have on Wall Street?
0.0	0.361115594698	He has got -- that is why he is on the end.
1.0	0.468461321349	We have 400,000 small businesses forming every year in this country.
0.0	0.102390587219	It is why we have to simplify.
0.0	0.203765961072	Carl, are we really talking about getting government involved in fantasy football?
0.0	0.19002293761	Just tell them that, you put people in there, we're going to bomb them.
0.0	0.489756772772	We both agree that we have to get unaccountable money out of our political system and that we have to do much more to ensure that Wall Street never wrecks main street again.
0.0	0.363184139494	And it was with us for months, the smell, the air.
0.0	0.253983249004	The fact is if we don't address what's costing so much, we can't throw enough money at this.
0.0	0.353491871861	If they had guns, he wouldn't be around very long.
0.0	0.735082483202	I would say the message that got us the win in Iowa and 10 other states against pretty overwhelming odds, is the message that's going to deliver us in this election.
0.0	0.595274672036	That is principally an American-led air campaign that we are now engaged in.
0.0	0.677806246061	Yes, the wealthiest people, the top 1.5 percent, will pay more in taxes.
0.0	0.0550547088182	I want to get ahead of those, and that's why I've proposed a much more comprehensive approach to deal with all of these...
0.0	0.346102400281	You got Kuwait and you got Qatar and you got Saudi Arabia.
0.0	0.5	There is no money in the Social Security account.
0.0	0.138172156882	How about talking about the substantive issues the people care about?
0.0	0.40931090832	When we do business with China, they tax us.
0.0	0.0900411824263	That is not right.
0.0	0.222482305316	But now as I travel the country, people say what I feel.
0.0	0.192218363138	We need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources, but from sources overseas, that can be a real-time fusion effort to get information where it's needed.
0.0	0.304533583781	Come on, that's just not -- you scare senior citizens with that.
0.0	0.207692470246	Neil, my name was mentioned as well.
0.0	0.302066281035	No, not a comic book, and it's not a very nicely asked question the way you say that.
0.0	0.379002680059	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.462100150244	And we fought for statewide school choice, where the dollars follow the child, instead of the child following the dollars.
0.0	0.153749285916	I've done it.
0.0	0.104485378936	It's a joke.
0.0	0.186035954874	Is there going to be any change in the House with new leadership?
0.0	0.123766312318	No, I said, " I would use -- " they were asking me what to do about North Korea.
0.0	0.850739032436	After that you pay 10 percent as a flat tax going up.
0.0	0.409092840887	We went after companies that were ripping off shareholders.
0.0	0.399530611916	People lost their jobs, their homes, their life savings.

0.0	0.233696673903	John, I'd like to address this?
0.0	0.0837663905111	Military action, Maria, would be used when it was absolutely necessary to protect American lives and protect American interests around the world.

0.0	0.189319942514	They've got to quit sponsoring Hezbollah and Hamas.

0.0	0.225574047257	And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
0.0	0.0562296361344	He might not take my phone call, but he would get the message, and the message is this: Until you open every nuclear and every military facility to full, open, anytime/anywhere, for real, inspections, we are going to make it as difficult as possible for you to move money around the global financial system.

0.0	0.229945841363	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.315802883484	I didn't say permanently.

0.0	0.248362375486	We need someone with a steady hand being president of the United States.
0.0	0.276384483017	And then what he did is redefine the role of government.
0.0	0.0925260482113	I think it's a mistake to create new and more expensive entitlement programs when we can't afford the ones we've got today.
0.0	0.169497356531	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.379375680522	Let's quit blaming the people on Social Security.

0.0	0.138134264656	Ben Carson, can you do math?
0.0	0.0541482333685	... on Larry Tribe.
0.0	0.907877896346	92 percent -- 92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama's first term belonged to women.
0.0	0.269662978635	OK. You know, the Democrats who have the ultimate super PAC, it's called the mainstream media.
0.0	0.146809121047	You know, frankly, I did it in Washington, in Ohio, and I will do it again in Washington, if I'm president, to get this country moving again.
0.0	0.205064512925	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.085876864345	So let's support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition.
0.0	0.172656557395	This is the unholy alliance that people need to know about between right and left.
0.0	0.0979375093486	Stimulating the economy -- because it's tethered down right now with so many regulations...
0.0	0.289502897069	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.457823923687	We have to go after terrorist networks, predominantly ISIS -- that's not the only one, but let's focus on that for a minute.
0.0	0.099240325634	So let's start by knowing where your money is being spent by the federal government.
0.0	0.274506893268	And I went there, and for 16 years, I fought the insiders and was able to get things done.
0.0	0.343826772731	The president tried to paint a rosy picture of jobs.
0.0	0.0817089600837	We're going to suspend and repeal every executive order, every regulation that cost American jobs and is -- is -- is impacting our freedom.
0.0	0.0554098359723	But I would probably have my children run it with my executives and I wouldn't ever be involved because I wouldn't care about anything but our country, anything.
0.0	0.31179124295	We differ, however, on a couple of key points.
0.0	0.268176181094	It's their money.
0.0	0.450526434962	To use the Justice Department, as we just saw, they have said they are going to sue Ferguson, that entered into a consent agreement, and then tried to back out.
0.0	0.419607190494	They understand the vulnerabilities we have on the southern border.
0.0	0.570580252216	If you're a farmer, if you're a rancher, if you are small business owner, the death tax is gone.
0.0	0.0659532794031	And when I look at Washington today, we need to bring us together.
0.0	0.148498822546	We're not going to dismantle everything.
0.0	0.397553042692	This is 2016.
0.0	0.166489958448	We're becoming Greece if we don't work together.
0.0	0.176061406006	Not -- not on that, no.
0.0	0.168742333847	Well, I would really appreciate that.
0.0	0.180432851255	That's why I ask for your support for president.
0.0	0.335148126093	That is not consistent conservatism, that is political calculation.
1.0	0.228452560446	It isn't there anymore, Mike.
0.0	0.36839823609	So, yes, I do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white Americans -- particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have -- you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is.
0.0	0.30051680651	Oh, well, you know, it just didn't work out for you.

0.0	0.678760596344	Bring the money -- the $2 trillion -- back to the United States.
0.0	0.280618626534	But the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, it's to understand what happens the day after.
0.0	0.707993579117	Whose fault is it that Medicare is broken, out of money, that Social Security is broken, out of money?
0.0	0.405973585199	And I ended a federal entitlement.
0.0	0.10244256034	I'm a fighter.
1.0	0.645077976164	I've used it three times, maybe four times.
0.0	0.27738261002	The Democrats can't even come up with one.
0.0	0.426615102106	We need somebody ready to be commander-in-chief on day one, who understands there are no moderates in Iran, they've been killed a long time ago.
0.0	0.106202163186	Let me say on that...
0.0	0.205881354972	The second will be to the supreme leader of Iran.
0.0	0.0766683767162	It feels different.
0.0	0.310089284914	I believe that our Constitution protects everybody, regardless of their sexual orientation or any other aspect.
0.0	0.292364390555	One of them being that if you don't have some agreement within the system from states and from families and from students, it's hard to get to where we need to go.
0.0	0.247005108065	Nobody -- I could stand up here all night.
0.0	0.126815162315	... who got us out of that...
0.0	0.0849632657956	The government ought to wear a striped shirt and just make sure the game...
0.0	0.0814430107507	And sending that signal makes it impossible for us to be serious about taking out ISIS and restoring democracy in Syria.
0.0	0.898467453082	And the only reason we got them back is because we owed them with a stupid deal, $150 billion.
0.0	0.58839338265	This has gone on 50 or 60 years where the United States has been involved in overthrowing governments.
0.0	0.907223914935	We have $2.5 trillion outside of the United States which we want to bring back in.
0.0	0.0677821587219	That will be my mission as president.
0.0	0.555096770685	And I also want to recognize the people in that church that showed the grace of God and the grace of forgiveness and the mercy that they showed.
0.0	0.261898484681	They're a scam.
0.0	0.157100502443	The truth is this, the big problem, we need a leader in Washington who understands how to get something done, not to talk about it, not to propose it, to get it done.
0.0	0.248385842068	...John...
0.0	0.482062599733	Nevertheless, one of the things that I think people don't always understand is how accountable a CEO actually is.
0.0	0.243977907609	Two points.
0.0	0.163057741398	With a couple of additional tweaks, we know what this will do.

0.0	0.4274781768	As president of the United States, I will be a commander in chief that will have the back of the military.
0.0	0.773758547076	Change the Mexico City policy, not take one dime of taxpayer money to fund abortion organizations overseas, and restore the NSA that's been gutted.
0.0	0.32153482857	Imagine a country where people are lifted out of poverty again.
0.0	0.0370508384201	How about we get the government to do what they're supposed to be doing, secure our borders, protect our people, and support American values and American families.
0.0	0.266801387396	That sounds like a long time ago.
0.0	0.171008605636	You know, the Russians wanted to buy time.
0.0	0.219684591065	But like all of our problems, there isn't a single one that can't be solved with common sense if you remove the ego and the politics.
0.0	0.269886201813	We have to get down to creating a country that's not going to have the kind of problems that we've had with people flying planes into the World Trade Centers, with the -- with the shootings in California, with all the problems all over the world.
0.0	0.144559098514	And you can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.178220672411	That is absolutely not right.
0.0	0.197500944798	You're going away for a long, long while.
0.0	0.187864508279	Well, John, I don't really have any weaknesses that I can think of.
0.0	0.0704876180604	They need to learn English, adopt our values, roll up their sleeves and get to work.
0.0	0.321663061809	Have you ever disagreed with a president?
0.0	0.354202776869	I've been there 35 times.
0.0	0.133523095611	If you're running for president of the United States and you don't understand that we need more American ground forces in Iraq and that America has to be part of a regional ground force that will go into Syria and destroy ISIL in Syria, then you're not ready to be commander in chief.
0.0	0.375106136491	Atlantic City has gone bad.

0.0	0.367608099621	You don't know it, they tax us.
1.0	0.999994993196	We had a $1.4 trillion deficit.

0.0	0.659778185204	I was governor of New York on September 11.
0.0	0.0730640790754	Sometimes it's a complicated situation, but some things are black and white.
0.0	0.192407102709	And not just green cards.

0.0	0.190543789185	And that's what we should focus on is the violence in our communities.
0.0	0.17042000042	And at the end of the day, it was the president's decision.
0.0	0.0690431491111	It is undermining American democracy.
0.0	0.409620207037	You get, like, three days where you have to show up?
0.0	0.336851626139	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.161196301196	I say, yes, not only do we give them what they need, but we don't tie their hands behind their backs so that they can go ahead and get the job done.
0.0	0.327790303564	And unlike President Obama, where he refuses even to use the term of what's going on, he can't use the term for whatever reason.
0.0	0.391763217998	And so everybody needs to discount some of the things you're going to hear in these ads, and discount the -- the back-and-forth here, because every person here is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.316471019993	I want to tackle those barriers that stand in the way of too many Americans right now.
0.0	0.235201737544	It never happens.

0.0	0.662252759421	I was an Army intelligence agent and a veteran during the Cold War, assigned to West Germany.
0.0	0.228920504254	We can save and preserve and strengthen Social Security by making no changes for seniors, but for younger workers gradually increasing the retirement age, changing the rate of growth so that it matches inflation, and critically allowing younger workers to keep a portion of our tax payments in a personal account that we own, we control them, we can pass on to our kids.
0.0	0.0563629639373	We have the Russians and the Iranians working together, not to fight ISIS, but to prop up Assad.

0.0	0.551568542178	It's the strongest pro-worker immigration plan.

0.0	0.505132909046	I think now what I've called for is counsel for every child so that no child has to face any kind of process without someone who speaks and advocates for that child so that the right decision hopefully can be made.
0.0	0.221200228017	I want to -- before my time runs out I want to get back to this issue of ISIS versus Iran.
0.0	0.281816478331	We have a huge mental health problem in this country.
0.0	0.14162392294	That's fine.

0.0	0.169012652837	They're working as hard as they ever have, everything costs more, and they haven't had a raise in decades.
0.0	0.160641709686	The result of that, you had the Iranian Revolution coming in, and that is where we are today.
0.0	0.492809620409	You know, these plans would put us trillions and trillions of dollars in debt.
0.0	0.0783614407797	My point is this.
0.0	0.192359545283	No, absolutely not.
0.0	0.238268819792	And when FDR said, "Yeah, it is," that we're going to use all of the resources that we have to create jobs, to build homes, to feed people, to protect the farmers, we are a nation which if we come together there is nothing that we could not accomplish.
0.0	0.146121467253	Somebody says "I'm a fighter."
0.0	0.0715238586293	And I believe that the best way to do that is to be aggressive, to be principled, but to have the goal of trying to improve relations.
0.0	0.341743952888	And we need to bring our debt under control, make our economy stronger.
0.0	0.5	Just for the record.

0.0	0.106691469764	I'm too agreeable, easy going.
0.0	0.169890043342	And I'll go back to something that had been mentioned just a few minutes ago.
0.0	0.132233243649	Well, I've been --
0.0	0.133390797261	We are trying to bring America together around an agenda that works for working families and the middle class.
0.0	0.989531104799	We have seniors out there who are scared to death because this Congress -- this one that we have right now, just stole $150 billion from the Social Security retirement fund to give it to the Social Security disability fund.
0.0	0.396313749141	We need a ground force in Iraq and Syria, and America has to be part of that ground force.

0.0	0.426172905975	My tax plan enables you to fill out your taxes on a postcard so we can abolish the IRS.
0.0	0.149780444643	And the reasons why I've done is I don't believe we have a good process of being able to vet them.
0.0	0.291747799305	It's why you see Walgreens buying Rite Aid.
0.0	0.405508423724	This was a question on entitlements.
0.0	0.0780512232245	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.0855038342131	And you know, he's right.
0.0	0.0474941642669	No vision at all.
0.0	0.5	This is a group of people that burns people in cages, that is conducting genocide against Christians and Yazidis and others in the region.
0.0	0.167821047968	And if I could say just one thing.
0.0	0.24919296566	But we can do is defund Planned Parenthood, and by the way, put in place an absolute permanent ban on any taxpayer dollars ever being used to fund abortions.
0.0	0.160626566948	And we finally need to tackle the basics to cut this government down to size and hold it accountable.
0.0	0.149721770989	I will not take advice from Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.185663921045	I am convinced because I see how he works with his attorney general, not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.700134946547	But the average person takes out about $350,000.
0.0	0.306396923664	You know, the Security Council finally got around to adopting a resolution.
0.0	0.0131874249945	And there should be some regulation.
1.0	0.544201261201	Well, there's not question that we should be able to look at past president whether they're married to somebody who's running for president or not in terms of their past behavior and what it means.
0.0	0.229286746494	A rich person does not.
0.0	0.197549943835	Let me start -- I want to get to the substance of the question on jobs, but I want to start with something.
0.0	0.189437982234	Those three things put together are going to give confidence to job creators and you will begin to see wages rise.
0.0	0.13460361889	And the fact is it was wrong.
0.0	0.26192672503	He said, "there's a chill wind blowing through law enforcement in this country."

1.0	0.995704203098	We have the highest rate of childhood poverty among almost any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.455517422745	... that's what you say in a primary.
0.0	0.0669951822137	We have to be honest about it.
0.0	0.463572799997	I know we can do this because we're still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.225382584601	So let's set the facts straight.
0.0	0.331972965756	I changed that.
0.0	0.453358127779	No, John.
0.0	0.181075404609	What should we do?

0.0	0.655785307714	They said they would repeal Obamacare if we gave them the majority.
0.0	0.188250297264	They go to Harvard.
0.0	0.25812370792	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.11505460935	Well, let me -- let me first of all talk a little bit about my experience.
0.0	0.153577763099	Now, on to your substantive question.
0.0	0.106245277955	That's an interesting question.
0.0	0.151897548945	But the leaders have come forward to realize that protest is fine, but violence is wrong.
0.0	0.122113936828	OK, good.
0.0	0.0816835673576	And they wonder whether somebody is getting something to -- keeping them from getting it.

0.0	0.148529949836	Not my kind of guy.
0.0	0.202771606916	He has gone to China.
0.0	0.427669518807	Those are the hard numbers.
0.0	0.383535997797	And that is that one of the things you're watching tonight are 11 quality candidates debating an important issue.
0.0	0.569417537969	My program would move the 104 programs of the federal Department of Education into four block grants, and send them back to the states because income inequality is driven by a lack of skills when kids don't get what they need to be able to compete and win in this country.
0.0	0.709175771667	I voted for comprehensive immigration reform in 2007.
0.0	0.255587471319	We're going to suspend -- I've -- I've said this for four years.
0.0	0.212322197085	And I was proud to stand with him and support it.
0.0	0.109345314936	... you know, the -- the -- the fact of the matter is -- you know, if we fix the taxation system, make it absolutely fair, and get rid of the incredible regulations -- because every regulation is a tax, it's a -- on goods and services.
0.0	0.548074307627	I like Marco too, and two years ago, he called me a conservative reformer that New Jersey needed.
0.0	0.231929489898	Because it wouldn't work.
0.0	0.372246839278	You do legislation.

0.0	0.266262978831	Iran is sponsoring terrorism in many parts of the world, destabilizing areas.
0.0	0.249060771169	And I ask everyone in America to call Congress tomorrow and say enough is enough; no more debt.
0.0	0.245316128379	I don't think they dropped all the amendments into a hat and picked them out of a hat.
0.0	0.422979563841	A lot of people have jumped in here.

0.0	0.154717656053	We have been debating right here the core difference between conservatism and progressivism.
0.0	0.262252322941	Here's why, the president of the United States and both his attorney's general, they give the benefit of the doubt to the criminal, not to the police officers.
0.0	0.0846405075326	I would change them.
0.0	0.181021710654	I think President Obama has set a great example.
0.0	0.1602579015	We're going to bring jobs back from Japan, we're going to bring jobs back from China, we're going to bring, frankly, jobs back from Mexico where, as you probably saw, Nabisco is leaving Chicago with one of their biggest plants, and they're moving it to Mexico.
0.0	0.281202522259	We're going to cut Medicare and Medicaid, federal aid to education to help you, because the government is so terrible.

0.0	0.14093180313	And second, the First Amendment Defense Act, which is protecting religious liberty, if it's not passed by then, which I suspect it won't, because the president will veto it, I will institute an executive order to make sure that people of faith are not being -- not being harassed and persecuted by the federal government for standing up for the religious beliefs.
0.0	0.192116579204	We're going to create a border.

0.0	0.566660957653	You know, 200 years ago, America was founded on this powerful principle that our rights don't come from government.
0.0	0.133261602067	What I said was that I think that Dr. Carson's ideas are good ideas.
1.0	0.935781456335	We have the world's best military, even though he's done everything he can to diminish it.

0.0	0.714904623361	I think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether it's poison in the water of the children of Flint, or whether it's the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the LGBT community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, that's what I want to take on.
0.0	0.424482493351	Donald, Donald -- can I -- I hope you reconsider this, because this policy is a policy that makes it impossible to build the coalition necessary to take out ISIS.
0.0	0.160604269256	They don't care about American workers, they just care about bringing as many people in so they can get as many votes as they can.
0.0	0.198212088712	I got the briefings.
0.0	0.0491667951568	Well, first of all the -- the plan gives people the option of -- of opting out.
0.0	0.234674851443	When it comes to fossil fuels, we're going to find more here and use less.
0.0	0.0239473513591	We're gutting our military, and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were.
0.0	0.37609419169	It shifts it to the business, and it would allow middle class people to get a tax cut.
0.0	0.352545962518	And it's not the folks on Wall Street.
0.0	0.298786334593	Now, we're going to blame the people.
0.0	0.26965253687	White people?
0.0	0.565267701017	Do we still have standards?
0.0	0.640958706857	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.298384275217	She is still defending Planned Parenthood, and she is still her party's frontrunner.
0.0	0.389475975396	And so Senator Graham is right about this.
0.0	0.14104746042	Not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.204886041725	You've got to give people hope.
0.0	0.21875931378	And I'm going to do everything I can to address distressed communities, whether they are communities of color, whether they are white communities, whether they are in any part of our country.
0.0	0.9303731185	John, listen, let's keep in mind that for one-third of the 60 million Americans on Social Security it represents 90 percent of their income.
0.0	0.134024521103	And here's the last piece...
0.0	0.152321079267	The simple fact is that the world has been torn asunder.
0.0	0.155160237804	I think the times are much more serious.
0.0	0.238717712623	But we have to restore policing that will actually protect the communities that police officers are sworn to protect.
0.0	0.15609781586	Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point?
1.0	0.92091994915	And let us be clear that every proposal that I have introduced has been paid for.
0.0	0.453256124157	They get them on the black market.
0.0	0.999998936692	We'll tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money.
0.0	0.71293178918	Thousands of thousands -- you look at the number of companies and the number in terms of manufacturing of plans that we've lost -- 50,000 because of China.
0.0	0.783537977859	If I could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited.
0.0	0.587310140438	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, it is demonstrably true...
0.0	0.195057893617	And what we want to do is to control this.
0.0	0.602928228044	You target the bad guys.
0.0	0.327954863061	Well, I would suggest a fair tax system, and that's what we have proposed.
0.0	0.563263087041	So what we have tried to do and what President Obama succeeded in doing was to build on the health care system we have, get us to 90 percent coverage.
0.0	0.694160126143	...10% flat rate...
0.0	0.486556722025	The reason I did so well last time is not just because of the vision, it's because I have a track record in Washington, D.C. of getting things done.
0.0	0.128449898972	We will arm and train the Kurds.
0.0	0.471075633724	I am a little skeptical about your governor actually caring enough about higher education to make any kind of commitment like that.
0.0	0.207199008582	They're looking -- they're recruiting people that enter this country as doctors and engineers and even fiances.
0.0	0.5	The billionaire and the working man, no hedge fund manager pays less than his secretary.
0.0	0.232569042597	The New York Times a few weeks back had a columnist who wrote a column saying, "Anybody But Cruz."
0.0	0.0242078677823	And when you do that, you will be amazed at how much progress you can make, and how much healing we can have.
0.0	0.316292904502	Ours was intended to be a citizen government.
0.0	0.257118586404	We do that, this country would be safe and secure again not only from criminals but from the terrorist who threaten us as well.
0.0	0.298685624538	There is a war against ISIS, not just against ISIS but against radical jihadists terrorists, and it is a war that they win or we win.
0.0	0.72685830507	We've cut 26 percent of our budget.
0.0	0.108048749849	I'm too trusting.
0.0	0.0132406888673	It's not my PAC.
0.0	0.257823758327	My mother is on Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.0165424912463	I agree with them.
0.0	0.408274451625	The law itself requires a background check, but that didn't fulfill their part of the bargain within the time that they were supposed to do.
0.0	0.794785387497	And, it turns out that up until -- and this has blown me away, never in a million years would I have believed that I would be standing here tonight telling you that we have received three and a half million individual contributions from well over a million people.
0.0	0.262063992739	And by the way, I hope we can end the trade embargo with Cuba as well.
0.0	0.100069556572	We feel like we're being left behind and left out.
0.0	0.316899205051	I believe in the PTT because it's important those countries in Asia are interfacing against China.
0.0	0.296154549909	Helping business make profits.
0.0	0.859742742271	So yes, I will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year pay zero, zero in federal income tax.
1.0	0.917797731439	And yet they are seeing almost all new income and all new wealth going to the top 1 percent.
0.0	0.455376236438	Because of a series of disastrous trade policies which have allowed corporate America through NAFTA and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, Secretary Clinton and I disagree on those issues.
0.0	0.357003797799	But the voters are savvier than that.
0.0	0.454688055834	But if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things, including corporate taxes, and including the capital gains taxes, you make that amount up pretty quickly.
0.0	0.664629307543	Every one of us is gifted by God, whether it is those poor babies being picked over or it's someone whose life is tangled up in a web of dependence.
0.0	0.705140229725	Anybody who tells me that we need every penny and every one of those is in a fantasy world.
0.0	0.0680024046217	Appreciate it.
0.0	0.156292011635	They can have it anyway you want.
0.0	0.34389281519	That is absolutely inaccurate.
1.0	0.994634347303	Twenty-nine million people have no health insurance today in America.
0.0	0.192303821024	Why in God's name does Wall Street...
0.0	0.310578541622	And in fact, in Obama administration, we did not meet with anybody without conditions.
0.0	0.516698598604	If you just cut their income tax, there isn't much income tax to cut.
0.0	0.279973577386	We're going to take the political handcuffs off the military.
0.0	0.0319841082952	...Thank you.
0.0	0.0911216899173	Right.
0.0	0.141032108994	We need somebody who can balance budgets, cut taxes...
0.0	0.221781889077	We will win on everything we do.
0.0	0.206602300923	You spend the money today and then you hope you're going to save money tomorrow.
0.0	0.110353050616	And that's what I hear from some people, "we'll do nothing and it will just be fixed."
0.0	0.221036158042	And this summer, we didn't do that.
0.0	0.656202335515	When millions of Americans rose up against amnesty, I was proud to lead that fight.
0.0	0.0749186436742	Under that theory, not only would I be disqualified, Marco Rubio would be disqualified, Bobby Jindal would be disqualified and, interestingly enough, Donald J. Trump would be disqualified.
0.0	0.270943922988	Bill, here's the interesting position on this.
0.0	0.136938253348	Ever.
0.0	0.283411338127	All I'm saying is our next president has to be someone that undoes the damage Barack Obama has done to this country.
0.0	0.130333292254	If you can encrypt messages, ISIS can, over these platforms, and we have no ability to have a cooperative relationship --

0.0	0.0563437793066	..."diabetes, heart disease, cancer and Alzheimer's?"
0.0	0.50645398585	That's why we embraced free enterprise, and it made us the most prosperous people in the history of the world.
0.0	0.293720624768	I mean, what we had was something the government made -- basically a bag of gas -- that cut loose, destroyed everything in its path, left thousands of people powerless, but they couldn't get rid of it because we had too much money invested in it, so we had to keep it.
0.0	0.481506396387	And nobody, nobody on either one of these stages has done more than I've done and the people of the State of Texas to deal with securing that border.
0.0	0.122560993539	They're protectionist.
0.0	0.0601556842445	And I'm not blaming these folks -- but I guess I could.
0.0	0.5	Marco stood with Chuck Schumer and Barack Obama on amnesty.
0.0	0.154719504121	That is...
0.0	0.487577861659	And I would note the Senate just a few weeks ago voted to suspend refugees from Middle Eastern countries.
0.0	0.332687855721	Here's the thing that I would ask Donald Trump in all seriousness.
1.0	0.990227414846	Third, if you look at my record as governor of New Jersey, I have vetoed a 50-caliber rifle ban.
0.0	0.259219520252	Community banks are going out of business.

0.0	0.160109615221	It was a big insurance company, AIG.

0.0	0.0938020134723	I would sign an executive order protecting religious liberty, our first amendment rights, so Christian business owners and individuals don't face discrimination for having a traditional view of marriage.
0.0	0.309242951036	I think, though, government is too big now.
0.0	0.135054804971	So you know what?

0.0	0.168579516817	Check it out.
0.0	0.230926681335	Let's start with immigration and have a little bit of clarity.
0.0	0.395561850274	Well, as you know, I'm a former elected prosecutor, a former elected attorney general, trained at the University of Virginia in constitutional law, and I don't believe in litmus tests except this.

0.0	0.45636430659	We've laid out a national energy plan that says that we should invest in all types of energy.
0.0	0.435383895737	You know, we have to stop this because, you know, if we manage to damage ourselves, and we lose the next election, and a progressive gets in there and they get two or three Supreme Court picks, this nation is over as we know it.
0.0	0.451798693814	Maybe it's because I hadn't given money to the foundation or donated to his wife's Senate campaign.
0.0	0.182999911668	Fiscal discipline, know what you're doing.
0.0	0.605266542137	We've been the most pro-life state six years in a row.
0.0	0.4626570397	I think the last eight years in the private sector have allowed me to see government from the outside, and I think that is a positive thing.
0.0	0.792004134453	The isolationist is the one who wants to continue to follow a foreign policy that has fewer democracies today than when Barack Obama came into office around the world.
0.0	0.0169618004434	I've lived my whole life fighting -- fighting for things that I believe in, fighting for justice and to protect people from crime and terrorism, fighting to stand up for folks who have not had enough and need an opportunity to get more, and to stand up and fight against the special interests.
0.0	0.966227031923	And there are 48 million people involved -- 40 million, 65 and over, and 8 million other.
0.0	0.237686054184	So why are the pharmaceutical companies consolidating?
0.0	0.378907093764	We should reimpose sanctions, they've already violated sanctions after this agreement was signed by testing medium-range missiles.
0.0	0.165029258635	All right, look, this has been a great debate.
0.0	0.218479632997	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.0911216899173	Right.
0.0	0.173250359758	That's what they're doing.
0.0	0.169322534905	But in 2015, we have a very different economy.
0.0	0.295664878109	I think we're on the verge of the greatest time, and I want to fix the things to let people rise up.
0.0	0.209127786854	I think the times are different now.
0.0	0.931905255884	And if you make $40,000 a year, a family of four, you don't pay any income tax at all.
0.0	0.201226711753	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.351388936173	I can't speak for the Koch Brothers, you're referring to a Super PAC that we don't coordinate with, that was set up to support President Obama, that has now decided that they want to support me.
0.0	0.29905812967	We had Hamas.
0.0	0.210750306347	And we're talking about fantasy football?
0.0	0.769845839114	This is one of the areas I've disagreed with Senator Sanders on, who has called for Iranian troops trying to end civil war in Syria, which I think would be a grave mistake.
0.0	0.843297700637	Now, I for seven years was the U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.256977779978	I will, with your help and support, lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.122700051338	Oh, I'll talk about that, too.
0.0	0.409383090884	The men and women on this stage have more ideas, more experience, more common sense than every participant in the Democratic debate.
0.0	0.236685107795	Right now, corporations, by the thousands, are thinking of leaving our country with the jobs -- leave them behind.
0.0	0.197519423508	You don't have to say that.
1.0	0.976769010327	He voted in favor of regime change with Libya, voted in favor of the Security Council being an active participate in setting the parameters for what we would do, which of course we followed through on.
0.0	0.530586835378	Sometimes it's because the Federal Reserve kept interest rates so low that the wealthy were able to invest in -- in strong assets like the stock market when everybody else was left behind.
0.0	0.586296033265	I'm 44 years old.
0.0	0.906091766613	Let me just say, if you're talking about an $18 trillion economy, you're talking about a 15 percent tax on your gross domestic product.
0.0	0.198922364336	Our country doesn't win anymore.
0.0	0.26941526098	They're making a half, two-thirds what they used to make.

0.0	0.0542303038269	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.0658885555157	We're going to lose Social Security and Medicare if Republicans and Democrats do not come together and find a solution like Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.15917169053	So you might not.
0.0	0.346289159044	That's the side we need to be on, and that's the side of the bulk of the -- of the Middle East.
1.0	0.913019996814	Not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama and the big government economy, the median wage for women has dropped $733.
0.0	0.629006320371	And under the laws of this country, he wasn't allowed to be with his father for seven years.

0.0	0.204611072069	China, they don't like to tell us but they have total control -- just about, of North Korea.
0.0	0.0979794823747	Both served.
0.0	0.286938262948	They do whatever what they do, OK.
1.0	0.991154532854	When President Obama came into office we were losing 800,000 jobs a month, 800,000 jobs a month.
0.0	0.228761950378	Well, we've gotta turn the economy around for people who are struggling.
0.0	0.19385080813	A healthy environment, a strong economy and energy independent America -- that would be the purpose of my presidency, is break the strangle hold that people enjoy on fossil fuels who hate our guts.
0.0	0.538584766365	To repeal these unconstitutional illegal orders, whether it's amnesty or whether it's this president going around the Congress, whether it's in Obamacare, to restore the rule of law.
0.0	0.401021801156	You want to see a war on women?
0.0	0.456753703001	We need a president that doesn't just talk a game, but a president that's got real results.
0.0	0.230588919379	I do.
0.0	0.486632471561	They don't buy their guns from a collector.
0.0	0.107311877845	I would just say that...
0.0	0.191231357202	...Then I'll buy you a tequila...
0.0	0.207896074649	And for the life of me, I have no understanding why the president thinks that everything is going well.
0.0	0.0432932008632	It has to be based on what skills you have, what you can contribute economically, and most important of all, on whether or not you're coming here to become an American, not just live in America, but be an American.
0.0	0.123707624098	Let me just -- let me respond.
0.0	0.221518146112	We're going to end up in the same place.
0.0	0.286881261819	If that's not hypocrisy, I don't know what hypocrisy is.
0.0	0.241590923069	I mean, literally, the Senate -- what is it, like a French work week?
0.0	0.0678574131205	... president of the United States has got to do, and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility, is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe.
0.0	0.260408896985	I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King.
0.0	0.437555160431	And I'm very grateful to the brave Navy SEALs who carried out that mission.
0.0	0.110551226361	I mean, Chris will know about that.
0.0	0.248247610594	Well, first of all, thank you all for having us.
0.0	0.074876342302	The answer is no.

0.0	0.334708499824	I've seen plenty of other people follow up?
0.0	0.241396472709	In Louisiana, instead we're helping people getting better paying jobs so they can provide for their own health care.
0.0	0.217316215138	We're closing hospitals, we're closing wards, we're closing so many because the states want to save money.
0.0	0.573676851776	Well, first of all, I'm 7 and 0 in my fantasy league.
0.0	0.0509351953828	And guess what?

0.0	0.146578818996	Take it from Lawrence Tribe.
1.0	0.922234488673	In 2008, Barack Obama missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes, and the same newspaper endorsed him again.
0.0	0.144279991142	That's good.
0.0	0.0617353770621	You didn't see these kind of ideas being batted around, and being batted around in a way that's civil and smart and that's trying to help to inform the voter out there.
0.0	0.103458836703	I'm tired of seeing what's going on, between the border where the people flow over; people come in; they live; they shoot.
0.0	0.216297149986	That's why we embraced individual liberty, and we became the freest people ever, and the result was the American miracle.
0.0	0.54523502108	Well, first of all, when we talk about the Import Export Bank, it's time to clean up corporate welfare.
0.0	0.256068108315	And you don't go tell Muslim nations you want them to be part of a coalition when you have a leading candidate for president of the United States who insults their religion.

0.0	0.150009641653	I want to talk to the folks at home.
0.0	0.300456517179	First, we should pass the Expatriate Terrorist Act, legislation I've introduced that says if an American goes and joins ISIS and wages jihad against America, that you forfeit your citizenship and you can not come in on a passport.

0.0	0.0446769807609	What's crony capitalism?
0.0	0.3480513017	The questions that have been asked so far in this debate illustrate why the American people don't trust the media.
0.0	0.0553434296677	OK?
0.0	0.396388381124	We can't afford another four years of that.

0.0	0.577268992521	You had two one hundred...
0.0	0.0467331569073	Thank you.
0.0	0.0555202767271	So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives.
0.0	0.0805286904368	And we do need China -- Donald's right about North Korea.
0.0	0.139685410238	But it doesn't change my view that we need to empower everyone, women and men, to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make.

0.0	0.0686464131116	But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work.
0.0	0.220636088982	It turns out we knew something was wrong.
0.0	0.0704373095436	Becky --
0.0	0.405878329957	They don't like somebody else like David Petraeus, they prosecute them and send a decorated general on to disgrace.
0.0	0.354090721806	If you get caught abusing this program, you should never be able to use it again.
0.0	0.255646677872	Our job has to be to recognize the conflict between the two.
0.0	0.942783192832	I wanna tell you, in my state, we took Medicaid, the hardest program to control, and we took it from a 10 percent growth rate to 2.5 percent without taking one person off the rolls or cutting one single benefit.
0.0	0.211805557604	That's my bill.
0.0	0.263039061276	You know, I think my biggest weakness is exactly the opposite.
0.0	0.107932531327	Well, it's interesting.
0.0	0.272168659199	If we're gonna reform welfare for poor people, we ought to reform it for rich people, as well.
0.0	0.186614226596	You're right.
0.0	0.441858262663	We have this enormous mismatch because we have smaller and smaller families.
0.0	0.167436240413	I used the tithing analogy.
0.0	0.331376086897	I am all in favor of keeping these talented people here so they can go to work in Silicon Valley.
0.0	0.274275778377	Work requirements and time limits.
0.0	0.134067024694	For too long -- no, for too long, what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our people's jobs, and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us.
0.0	0.26873260626	They've been beaten into submission.
0.0	0.32801072128	And I'll tell you why, last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee, she admitted she had sent emails to her family saying, hey, this attack in Benghazi was caused by al Qaeda-like elements.
0.0	0.0700787604874	I frankly don't think there will be much change because I think what's going to happen is you're going to get more of the same.
0.0	0.566451707112	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.319134966027	A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to go on a congressional delegation.
0.0	0.558779871534	But the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with Iran, maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world, yes, that is something I want to achieve.
0.0	0.200529165419	You can -- if you -- you flew in with your 767, didn't you?
0.0	0.0375383496317	No accomplishment.
0.0	0.376092097474	We're going to get more revenue.
0.0	0.0422276335148	Where the secretary and I have a very profound difference, in the last debate -- and I believe in her book -- very good book, by the way -- in her book and in this last debate, she talked about getting the approval or the support or the mentoring of Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.202546408276	There are other attorneys that feel, and very, very fine constitutional attorneys, that feel that because he was not born on the land, he cannot run for office.
0.0	0.0527915061354	And I just couldn't agree -- disagree more with those kinds of comments.
0.0	0.72288321271	You know, we could give you another example -- the Marines, the Army, these wonderful six soldiers that were killed.
0.0	0.45583304983	It just needs a corporate executive type at the top that's done it before.
0.0	0.482081432551	And, you know the old inscription, if you save one life, you've changed the world.
0.0	0.25812370792	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.338724184949	The majority of people in American actually have values and principles and they believe in the very things that made America great.
0.0	0.607507753284	Imagine how hard it is for these people out there that are making 40, 50, $60,000 a year, and they're trying to provide for their families at a time when this economy is not growing.
0.0	0.516629876856	I'll tell you this, the number one job of the president of the United States is to protect the safety and security of the American people.
0.0	0.367573570841	The point I'm making is this, the Federal Government should not be in a lot of things.
0.0	0.410366495822	And I think the reason he did is because immigration is sort of an example of what's broken and what's wrong in Washington, D..C.
0.0	0.0674043548856	Okay.
0.0	0.473177676583	I worked hard with not only federal agents but with police officers and here's the problem, sanctuary cities is part of the problem in this country.
0.0	0.123963047261	I have proposed there be a Middle East NATO so that we can combine our allies there to stand up to Iranian expansion, and at the same time join together to begin to stop and this ISIL thing before it becomes an actual state.
0.0	0.197326467802	The fact is, there's a number of things that the next president is going to have to do to clean up this mess.
0.0	0.149735471039	I think -- I think it's fair to say we don't have a disagreement.
0.0	0.193300661917	We have Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view.
0.0	0.132355403326	Big difference.
0.0	0.228546435377	But guess who pushed for that regulation?
1.0	0.886967057746	Workforce participation rates lower than they were in 1977.
0.0	0.0952375840972	And it's not too much to ask of our generation after everything our parents and our grandparents did for us.
0.0	0.0869421801309	But we stuck to our message.
0.0	0.146092835944	We have more Americans out of work or just Americans who quit looking for work for 40 years.
0.0	0.146663277152	They didn't do that.
0.0	0.059712355343	We need a president who can solve our problems, bring us together.
0.0	0.15564243517	The fact is, there is a big overhang.
0.0	0.212030856279	I will not shock anybody to suggest that in politics there is occasionally a little bit of hypocrisy.
0.0	0.426480117019	If we -- if we don't act now, we are going to be the first generation in American history that leaves our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.0489510051003	And if I am elected president, to every soldier and sailor and airman and marine, and to every police officer and firefighter and first responder who risk their lives to keep us safe, I will have your back.
1.0	0.978721719935	He put a 25 million dollar check up from his own pocket to fund that campaign and my wife Heidi and I, we ended up investing everything we owned.
0.0	0.493479580595	I don't think the founders put the Second Amendment as number two by accident.
0.0	0.259838073506	It is an agenda, in my view, that would do great harm to our country.
0.0	0.336068513029	He is not the only one.
0.0	0.239038318699	Well, to start with, unlike President Obama, I'll actually name the enemy that we confront.
0.0	0.300450637508	It's now half the size of what it was prior to Operation Desert Storm.
0.0	0.151039161315	You're not interested in an answer.
0.0	0.0708750288236	And how do I know it?
0.0	0.140675151756	I'm not -- my campaign is going to be about the future of America, it's not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage.
0.0	0.0887275053444	But the Democrats are going to bring a lawsuit, and you have to have certainty.
0.0	0.086011561669	Well, I believe that there are abuses, those companies should be permanently barred from ever using the program again and we should put strict standards in place to ensure that they're not being abused, like the prevailing wage requirement and like the advertising requirement.
0.0	0.195385235038	And they got a killer in San Bernardino in posing as a fiance.
0.0	0.0687921796645	... and I know Bernie, and I can promise you he's not going to be president of the United States.
0.0	0.583097691705	It's one of the biggest problems our country has.
0.0	0.158832971055	You know, coal miners and their families who helped turn on the lights and power our factories for generations are now wondering, has our country forgotten us?
0.0	0.279283160191	You look at California, you look, frankly, at Paris where there's a -- the strictest no-gun policy of any city anywhere in the world, and you see what happens: 130 people dead with many to follow.
0.0	0.0914409137324	And this big powerful, corrupt bureaucracy works now only for the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected.
0.0	0.338184978956	I don't think it's so much about when the government orders a corporation to do something.
0.0	0.126322913801	If we do that again, we will lose again, we will deserve to lose again.
0.0	0.214912926765	We're friends.
0.0	0.116456147509	I laid out a plan at the Citadel to do just that and it starts with creating a "No Fly Zone" and "Safe Zones" to make sure refugees are there.
0.0	0.229573170873	And that's what we have to contrast.
0.0	0.260901450076	I don't know if people understand, but I spent a lifetime with my colleagues getting us to a federal balanced budget.
0.0	0.820272133517	But when we talk about Wall Street, you have Wall Street and major banks have paid $200 billion in fines since the great crash.
0.0	0.0467331569073	Thank you.
0.0	0.123055228319	And I'll note that California senator -- Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said, if she could say to Mr. America and Mrs. America, "give me your guns, I'm rounding them up," she would.
0.0	0.131986575018	But if I become president, I couldn't care less about my company.
0.0	0.277190886084	ISIS came in, and now occupies significant territory in Libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold.
0.0	0.514848785641	For both of them you have to gradually raise the age.
0.0	0.278643342876	Barack Obama got his massive tax increase, and there was no spending cuts.
0.0	0.125367664396	I love China.
0.0	0.563404404531	Why does the fossil fuel industry pay -- spend huge amounts of money on campaign contributions?
0.0	0.392434147848	I want to speak to all of those maddened by political correctness, where Hillary Clinton apologizes for saying all lives matter.
0.0	0.142256933523	I am proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend.
0.0	0.166701774096	You know, I am by my nature impatient.
0.0	0.186210417625	Progressives don't believe that.
0.0	0.606332517532	So this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement.
0.0	0.308139753415	Well, this is what I would say.
0.0	0.0750421543624	And I'll tell you what a weakness is of this country: there are a lot of people who are sick and tired because Washington does not play by the same rules that the American people have to play by.
0.0	0.393740773684	You bet they do.
0.0	0.224284284379	Let the states do this.
0.0	0.168026637178	I think, actually, people are looking for that in Washington now.
0.0	0.86509929299	Now 16 percent is what the rate Ted wants it at.
0.0	0.560358588486	A 100, 150 years ago incredibly brave Americans said, you know what, working class kids, low income kids should not have to work in factories or on the farms.
0.0	0.358217115236	We can make a stronger program.
0.0	0.224035632308	That never works.
0.0	0.123564470631	He's wrong.
0.0	0.366966404366	So I think the better approach, the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against China economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage Barack Obama is doing to this economy.
0.0	0.152271715665	But here's the point I want to make tonight.
0.0	0.566451707112	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.0909241013371	But here's the best way that we're going to make America much more exceptional: it is to make sure we put someone on that stage in September who will fight Hillary Clinton and make sure she never, ever gets in the White House again.
0.0	0.508165277366	His plan is a good plan, and I will note that my 10% plan also eliminates the payroll tax, eliminates the death tax,
0.0	0.277892140896	What I said was I don't believe that I would be president of the United States and have the same dysfunction that exists in Washington, D.C. now.
0.0	0.191563310858	I mean, let me be honest with the people who are watching at home.
0.0	0.0945064828031	Martha, religious liberty doesn't include encouraging a fellow American to engage in violent jihad and kill an American here.
0.0	0.157132353011	Nobody can solve it like me.
0.0	0.256770284791	And, we said no.
1.0	0.625590373322	In Florida, we have the lowest in-state tuition of any state, because there's accountability, just as John said.
0.0	0.983325567026	$19 billion of tax cuts, 1.3 million jobs created.
0.0	0.150979961017	And first of all, we've got to recognize that there is problem that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have caused.
0.0	0.392148192336	I didn't inherit any money.
0.0	0.150551419267	I'd like to jump in.
0.0	0.976367582823	You can't get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year.
0.0	0.462115776752	And by the way, as important as those two phone calls are, they are also very important because they say this.
0.0	0.127099383511	Here's the bottom line.
0.0	0.206194648643	I would just say this, we've heard a lot of great ideas up here, and I agree with what Senator Rubio said.
0.0	0.757420793198	I've heard about tax schemes that don't add up, that put our kids in -- in a deeper hole than they are today.
0.0	0.316421285585	This is absolutely disgusting, and revolts the conscience of the nation.
0.0	0.436816031056	John, could I follow up on this?
0.0	0.0739165930158	The answer is simple.
0.0	0.097137324895	Our vets are being treated horribly.
0.0	0.0895510719256	We have to put the personnel on that border in the right places; you have to put the strategic fencing in place; and you have to have aviation assets that fly all the way from Tijuana to El Paso to Brownsville, Texas -- 1,933 miles looking down 24/7, with the technology to be able to identify what individuals are doing, and ID when they are in obviously illegal activities or suspicious activities, and quick response teams come.
0.0	0.350280443167	And, here's the difference between me and Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.374542913848	Total propaganda.
0.0	0.154733972967	I know personally how extraordinary and unique this nation is.
0.0	0.137579037691	I have no illusion.
0.0	0.177455352725	You want to talk about moral authority.
0.0	0.153067482533	And, when I hear people talking about means testing, let's just remember what that means.
0.0	0.0900411824263	That's not right.
0.0	0.823215378661	The main problem with Medicare right now is that the average person pays in taxes over their whole lifetime about $100,000.
0.0	0.0649150825198	And we would still have governors like Scott Walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions.
0.0	0.230475550404	No, no.
0.0	0.192603220259	You know, we -- we agree that we've got to get unaccountable money out of politics.
0.0	0.259796469188	And that free education of extraordinary accomplishment was from first grade to 12th grade.
0.0	0.5	And, look, I think it's important to look at what the most important counterterrorism judgment of the first four years of the Obama administration was, and that was the very difficult decision as to whether or not to advise the president to go after bin Laden.
0.0	0.248552966956	We are borrowing money from China today.
0.0	0.228557166997	I mean, that's just the bottom line.
0.0	0.130717836058	Well, first of all, like many other very big businessmen, I could name them here, but I'm not going to do that for a lot of obvious reasons, but the biggest, and almost all of them, they've all used the chapter laws, the bankruptcy laws to their own benefit.
0.0	0.518844621966	And nobody watching at home believed that any of the moderators had any intention of voting in a Republican primary.
0.0	0.903464106287	We have to get the other 10 percent of the way to 100.
0.0	0.0735656617073	I would hope that you would come onboard and say that this is the simple and straightforward thing to do.
0.0	0.0724761557346	My Muslim friends, some, said, "thank you very much; we'll get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.290085897821	And the people who are often the most hard-hit are widows, because when their spouse dies, they can lose up to one-half of their Social Security monthly payment.
0.0	0.50840481367	I saw you on the Senate floor flip your vote on crop insurance because they told you it would help you in Iowa, and last week, we all saw you flip your vote on ethanol in Iowa for the same reason.
0.0	0.797023466245	They shouldn't automatically assume that because you believe that marriage is between one man and one woman that you are a homophobe.
0.0	0.225278255246	Yes.
0.0	0.174273992174	Donald is right that China is running over President Obama like he is a child, President Obama is not protecting American workers and we are getting hammered.
0.0	0.25002099053	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.00790804649946	Divide that out.
0.0	0.330526462339	I'm tested.
0.0	0.287743778927	Just like getting rid of Medicare and Medicaid.
0.0	0.269308357879	Here at home, we've got to do a better job coordinating between federal, state, and local law enforcement.
0.0	0.28859651518	We have made it easier to do that, not harder.
0.0	0.353533453435	It will be a way of life.
0.0	0.164001598377	So look, in foreign policy -- in foreign policy, it's strength, but you've got to be cool.
0.0	0.152047943672	And -- and -- you know, it goes back to the whole concept of regulations, which are in everything.
0.0	0.088060223657	But the real -- but I think we have to get back to what this election has to be about.
0.0	0.108449004744	Our next president, and our Republican nominee can not be someone who supports those positions.
0.0	0.591979962358	So beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given -- bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money.
0.0	0.241404879781	You know, Hillary Clinton's always saying how Republicans don't follow science?
0.0	0.223890288319	-- at least half of the things Marco said are flat-out false.
0.0	0.578104128869	I sell tens' of millions of (inaudible).
0.0	0.424844901384	That they were going to have to hire 20,000 new IRS agencies to collect it.
0.0	0.342863156039	Those are two leaders that I admire very much.
0.0	0.345457529343	The final observation, invoked Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.292101840979	That's exactly what we saw.
0.0	0.573403657138	Did any of you get a phone call from Bill Clinton?
0.0	0.563934880838	I have the largest bank in the world as a tenant of mine.
0.0	0.5	Every time we send signals like this, we send a signal of weakness, not strength.
0.0	0.124324987412	That's a serious issue that we could work on.
0.0	0.173426502947	You can trust me to do the following: that when I get on change with Hillary Clinton, we won't be debating about the science, we'll be debating about the solutions.
0.0	0.410792141518	Now you are a worker, white worker, black worker, who had a decent job, that manufacturing job is gone.
0.0	0.237423156925	So this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle.
0.0	0.205245381206	I don't care.
0.0	0.137980801278	And, this is what I am finding throughout America.
0.0	0.477216845567	I was the governor during the 9/11 attack when the Pentagon was struck.
0.0	0.213900903327	I know for a fact how difficult it is to raise children, how expensive it's become for working families.
0.0	0.328194851633	And if I were the prosecutor, that is exactly where they would be.
0.0	0.188731140337	First thing I'd tell the American people, whatever it takes to defend our nation, I would do.
0.0	0.134842187219	And I have a road map and a plan right now to get us to balance.
0.0	0.131571993121	And I'll tell you, I'm not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump.
0.0	0.186334973034	And that was the state of Texas.
0.0	0.363831061751	I'm not running against Governor Bush, I'm not running against anyone on this stage.
0.0	0.159761969478	Maybe we would've gotten a deal where we didn't give everything away.
0.0	0.414461925491	It comes from the right, from the left, from people on all sides of the political spectrum.
0.0	0.101150770468	Maria, I'd just like to say...
0.0	0.341665571835	Now we're having smaller families.
0.0	0.619506451218	Look, every time the Federal Government gets engaged in something it gets worse.
0.0	0.106692534925	Well, first, Judy, I have spent my entire adult life working toward making sure that women are empowered to make their own choices, even if that choice is not to vote for me.
0.0	0.155175218674	It goes in the right direction.
0.0	0.574562910122	It's a simple formula: common sense regulations, which is why I think we should freeze all federal regulations for one year, except for health and safety.
0.0	0.3293895725	We have to support the fighters on the ground, principally the Arabs and the Kurds who are willing to stand up and take territory back from Raqqa to Ramadi.
0.0	0.14162392294	That's fine.
0.0	0.288299261371	We can use it to break up the banks, if that's appropriate.
0.0	0.237292033736	Now, you've got Europe.
0.0	0.138362231685	Again...
0.0	0.103067265701	Now, thank God, my father was invited to a Bible study and became born again and he came back to my mom and me and we were raised together.
0.0	0.128524110346	See, they don't like that.
0.0	0.0911216899173	Right.
0.0	0.095034851284	And you can go get it at jeb2016.com.
0.0	0.291026730972	Secondly, as it relates to Iran, we need to confront their ambitions across the board.
0.0	0.10608894508	And I have the feeling you're going to find a lot of cost overruns there and a lot of waste and duplicative activities.
0.0	0.165444823554	And I'm saying we have to get to the bottom of it.
0.0	0.42615762553	I believe that we have got to pass comprehensive immigration reform, something that I strongly supported.
0.0	0.201605683863	You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president...
0.0	0.0984427502025	And -- and I would note indeed, the reason I said that is I was asked -- my friend Donald has taken to it as (ph) advance playing Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the USA", and I was asked what I thought of that.
0.0	0.149033116483	If there was a -- and you know I'm not bringing a suit.
0.0	0.84048129497	And now after seven years of your policies, we have the biggest majority we've had since the 1920s in the House; a Republican majority in the Senate; and 31 out of 50 Republican governors.
0.0	0.111012144448	Where are you gonna clean it up?
0.0	0.320132987031	And I believe that not only Barney Frank, Paul Krugman, and others, have said that what I have proposed is the most effective.
0.0	0.0180114378572	I'd also go after these sanctuary cities, do everything we can to make sure that we are not -- that we are actually prosecuting and cutting off funding for cities that are harboring illegal aliens, and then finally making sure the IRS is not going after conservative or religious groups.
0.0	0.0532076130392	But it is absolutely fair and necessary for Americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average American family?
0.0	0.693131693461	For 30 years this country has been baited with that.
0.0	0.163703993382	So, I think gun-free zones are a catastrophe.
0.0	0.135174663306	Here's -- apart from the -- apart from the higher prices on consumers and people are living paycheck to paycheck, apart from that, there will be retaliation.
0.0	0.13089858746	But what happened is a political vacuum developed.
0.0	0.271448552426	Hey look, he never had a chance.
0.0	0.14538257088	That has not been...
0.0	0.239296773886	We have got to destroy their training camps and recruiting centers.
0.0	0.230588919379	We do.
0.0	0.288173083911	So we have to go after this both abroad and at home.
0.0	0.423826212139	I said right from the beginning that we should take no Syrian refugees of any kind.
0.0	0.379694649367	First, rather than expand benefits for everyone, I do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs.
0.0	0.071136543347	I will not do that.
0.0	0.646486215568	Are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the Assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire?
0.0	0.2664023529	This campaign is not just about electing a president.
0.0	0.243156064958	When I'm president, we're going to have a president that acts like it.
0.0	0.234678362424	Look, the Second Amendment is not an option.
0.0	0.111514294321	I don't -- look, I don't think anybody should be expanding Medicaid.
0.0	0.114826940041	No -- no...
0.0	0.161153267982	Because I've done it.
0.0	0.150158379695	And as far as the Syrians are concerned, Al-Hasakah province, perfect place.
0.0	0.308022859374	Now, Bill, he loves to criticize America, apologize for us, criticize medieval Christians.
0.0	0.437168858815	And that's why I've come forward with, for example, a plan to revitalize coal country, the coalfield communities that have been so hard hit by the changing economy, by the reduction in the use of coal.
0.0	0.460417449179	Now, I'm the only person that's put out a detailed plan on how to deal with entitlements.
0.0	0.171707598089	Trying to get Iran and Saudi Arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter.
0.0	0.433637725109	Now hundreds of companies I've opened.
0.0	0.48876158223	Well, I think, Judy, what has to be appreciated is that, as a result of the disastrous and illegal behavior on Wall Street, millions of lives were hurt.
0.0	0.191373539935	Well, sure.
0.0	0.426650442558	Well, first of all, recognize it is a substantial problem.
0.0	0.493548346642	But I also think that these are very serious times; 75 percent of the American people think the federal government is corrupt.
0.0	0.116203927809	We have to find out -- many people knew about what was going on.
0.0	0.339197800003	And when countries violate trade agreements or dump product in this country, we need -- we need to stand up against those countries that do that without making them into an enemy.
0.0	0.36694850871	He got lucky with fracking.
0.0	0.604004835687	... that suspends all refugees from nations that ISIS or Al Qaida controls significant territory.
0.0	0.1065239696	As an outsider, I tackled H.P.
0.0	0.294342655618	They're tough, they're strong, they're great people.
0.0	0.262402641549	Are you concerned like I am that the debt and deficits of Washington, D.C. are endangering America's future?
0.0	0.985298877215	After those four years of looking back and being prepared, the preparation to be the most powerful individual in the world requires an extraordinary amount of work: not just having been the governor of the 12th largest economy in the world, which I might add, we added 1.5 million jobs during that period of time over that 2007 through 2014 period, a period when America was going through the most deep recession it had been through since the Great Depression.
0.0	0.0926142227512	Reforms, everything from moral and cultural issues to economic issues.
0.0	0.190671412639	Wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.313339623985	I was governor on September 11th, and I'm proud of my leadership in bringing New York through that time.
1.0	0.976345979206	Look, I have an A plus rating in the NRA and we also have a reduction in gun violence because in Florida, if you commit a crime with a gun, you're going away.
0.0	0.223000863818	Everybody's record's going to be scrutinized, and at the end of the day we need to unite behind the winner so we can defeat Hillary Clinton, because she is a disaster.
0.0	0.183306950172	That's the end of the conversation.
0.0	0.618566678882	We went after companies that were doing things that were against the law.
0.0	0.636431670987	And I appreciate greatly Senator Sanders' voting record.
0.0	0.153993343262	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.0627928608731	Super PACs are a disaster.
0.0	0.0471531451877	We have to do something.
0.0	0.45360415305	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.143143939037	We need a doer, not a talker.
0.0	0.232433675607	When I think about the folks who are out there at home tonight watching, and I think about what they had to watch this week -- the spectacle they had to watch on the floor of the House of Representatives, with the president of the United States, who talked a fantasy land about the way they're feeling.
0.0	0.283586822769	And not only did I fight them, but I beat them.
0.0	0.159733934073	It's a hard problem.
1.0	0.575183896444	You know, the FBI director, the president's appointed FBI director has said this week that because of a lack of support from politicians like the president of the United States, that police officers are afraid to get out of their cars; that they're afraid to enforce the law.
0.0	0.331313139181	Akin to slavery, where people came into this country to do guest work were abused, were exploited, and if they stood up for their rights, they'd be thrown out of this country.
0.0	0.453181146544	Right now, you don't have the -- you have taxes that are too high.
0.0	0.397042897079	And this is one of the myths that the left perpetrates on our society, and this is how they frighten people and get people to shut up.
0.0	0.982120212713	Yeah, but that -- because the math is, if you -- 5 percent of a million is a lot more than 5 percent of a thousand.
1.0	0.302649755995	We don't need the federal government to be involved in this at all.
0.0	0.096908258539	I mean, just think about a scenario like that.
0.0	0.148052133843	We're not going to be able to rebuild it unless we put a no-fly zone there, make it safe for those folks so we don't have to be talking about Syrian refugees anymore.
0.0	0.226808970071	Let me just say on taxes, how long have we been talking about tax reform in Washington, D.C.?
0.0	0.883167870593	I want to find out why those two young people -- those two horrible young people in California when they shot the 14 people, killed them -- people they knew, people that held the wedding reception for them.
0.0	0.131316303162	I love the Chinese people but they laugh themselves, they can't believe how stupid the American leadership is.
0.0	0.52463597708	We have a country of borders.
0.0	0.106965992115	I am a conservative; I can win this job, I can do this job, I need your help, I need your support.
0.0	0.0521403888952	And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word.
0.0	0.13890100509	...
0.0	0.362127113791	And if you go to my Web site, berniesanders.com, what you find is not only going to help lead the opposition to that war, but much of what I feared would happen when I spoke on the floor of the House, in fact, did happen in terms of the instability that occurred.
0.0	0.482218490043	We have to stop the money flow.
0.0	0.586107074524	What I said, and let me repeat it, I don't know what economists Secretary Clinton is talking to, but what I have said, and let me repeat it, that yes, the middle -- the family right in the middle of the economy would pay $500 dollars more in taxes, and get a reduction in their healthcare costs of $5,000 dollars.
0.0	0.0733764095683	Well, let me just -- let me just say, once again...
0.0	0.163226473889	It's peanuts.
0.0	0.712323770987	He's got probably a four or five percent chance.
0.0	0.927612036039	We're going to have a three-bracket tax code, 10, 15 and 25 percent.
0.0	0.240142866506	Let's talk about something that happened this week in the news.
0.0	0.11168149863	I would do that to Barack Obama's executive orders.
0.0	0.38326918476	Does he stand up for law enforcement?
0.0	0.144259476881	You've got to have a clear vision of where you want to go.
0.0	0.0804112337652	They expect to have it.
0.0	0.0956167377233	We will renew America if we work together, and I am totally confident that we will.
0.0	0.0428305660028	See?
0.0	0.171487719492	And let me be clear.
0.0	0.33754690949	Folks, the government has no business stealing even more from the people who have paid this in.
0.0	0.0978562090162	I don't know where you...
0.0	0.279103960045	Well, gee, after the last debate, I was told that I didn't smile enough.
0.0	0.435387007023	The guns don't pull the trigger.
0.0	0.0467331569073	Thank you.
0.0	0.0902146750941	And, folks, we will.
0.0	0.291838547244	She'd be a great president of the United States because the leadership she brought to H.P.
0.0	0.473164126011	Secondly, I certainly support that we need to tear down cyber walls, not on a mass basis, but on a targeted basis.
1.0	0.913447755758	And I know this, because when I ran for governor of New York, one in 11 of every man, woman, and child in the state of New York was on welfare.
1.0	0.12738109702	But I will -- but I will tell you this, the socialist says they're going to pay for everything and give you everything for free, except they don't say they're going to raise it through taxes to 90 percent to do it.

0.0	0.131330723234	But we are where we are right now.
0.0	0.18089382953	How about this?

0.0	0.881679945661	Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the co-chair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat.
0.0	0.28604297501	I love this country.
0.0	0.168579516817	Check it out.
0.0	0.156474796353	Well, there is no question that some people go overboard when it comes to trying to make profits, and they don't take into consideration the American people.
0.0	0.5	They do celebrate more dependence on the government.
0.0	0.151465173661	But, what we did is we said to the working families of this country, look, we know things are tough, but if you want to help us go beyond establishment politics, and establishment economics, send us something.
0.0	0.204450870817	But, now for millions of Americans, it's slipping away.
0.0	0.144796761126	He wants to change America.
0.0	0.236517629019	Well, it's an interesting question because I'm very proud of my company.
0.0	0.571645405357	He's been a good governor, and he's a heck of a lot better than his predecessor that would have bankrupted New Jersey.
0.0	0.243450645328	I'm not anti-Wall Street, but I don't believe the government ought to wear a team jersey, pick winners and losers.
0.0	0.0881465903189	And I'll allow putting that tariff or whatever he's saying here...
0.0	0.206325945968	We have to do this in unison with the Arab world.
0.0	0.279930962671	They do it to us, we don't it.
0.0	0.300437663076	There are ways to retrain the 50 and 51-year-olds, because they've got great value.
0.0	0.200079800548	And the last line standing between them and our families might be us and a gun.
0.0	0.18306502278	Americans are tired of hearing this debate -- want to go to, what are you going to do about illegal immigration?
0.0	0.449278627741	...income tax...
0.0	0.709665150324	... that after the 9/11 attacks, Secretary Rumsfeld invited me to the Pentagon with a meeting of the former secretaries of Defense.
0.0	0.225759118896	No.
0.0	0.138807090977	If we're going to have a coalition, we're going to have to have a coalition not just of people in the western part of the world, our European allies, but we need the Saudis, we need the Egyptians, we need the Jordanians, we need the Gulf states.
0.0	0.421212000427	But mostly, the highest calling of leadership is to challenge the status-quo and unlock the potential of others.
0.0	0.165860345188	(LAUGHTER) And he got nasty.
0.0	0.14471367753	Can I tell you what?
0.0	0.0423445516473	Think about it.
0.0	0.462388028579	It's fine if they come in, but they have to come in legally.
0.0	0.571824214413	It was LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations in this country.
0.0	0.121561116639	...you wrote a story on it, and you had to go back and correct it.
1.0	0.352990583742	They stole it.
0.0	0.39244865448	And we know of the tragic, terrible event that lead to the death of Dontre Hamilton right here in Milwaukee, a young man unarmed, who should still be with us.
0.0	0.179516595015	So you don't get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.172537320541	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.254799483515	He's a good guy, a smart guy, and he would be a heck of a lot better president than Hillary Rodham Clinton would ever be.
0.0	0.145789792318	Who actually has stood up not just to Democrats, but to leaders in our own party?
0.0	0.0395383234797	Ohio, one of the best growing places in the country -- I not only did it in Washington, I did it in Ohio, and I'll go back to Washington, and there will be no more silly deals...
0.0	0.199262559558	And this is not an endeavor that rewards that.
0.0	0.323177595914	Well, that's a real question.
0.0	0.244459186137	It can not be someone that agrees with his agenda.
0.0	0.926228649141	Yes, I believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on Wall Street, that they are a Wall Street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession -- Great Depression.
0.0	0.277592328746	Listen, in any Republican primary, everyone is going to say they support the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.308560448849	Reforming entitlements, cutting taxes.
0.0	0.0943784563145	That's who's in my mind
0.0	0.695690381515	It is imposed on business and a critical piece that Marco seems to be missing is that this 16 percent business flat tax enables us to eliminate the corporate income tax.
0.0	0.267738822168	We're bringing corporate taxes down, bringing money back in, corporate inversions.
0.0	0.119797198093	So there are people watching tonight in business.
0.0	0.094995464215	I just don't believe that this country's days are going to be deeply -- you know, going down.
0.0	0.867745743923	We were one of two states to go to AAA bond rating, and our government spending was far less than the spending in people's income.
0.0	0.139928269208	And so when we talk to our allies and we give them our word, in a Christie administration, they know we're going to keep it.
0.0	0.306568393023	You just don't make promises like this.
0.0	0.158044467581	It is broke, it is not working.
0.0	0.703821228999	Illegal.
0.0	0.247127855593	Can you have Medicare or Social Security?
0.0	0.109353902179	Here's my second problem.
0.0	0.55351486749	... and here's the critical point, Maria -- the business flat tax enables us to abolish the corporate income tax, the death tax, the Obamacare taxes, the payroll taxes, and they're border-adjustable, so every export pays no taxes whatsoever.
0.0	0.362573346495	My four children have been able to receive a good Christian education, and I've been able to save for them to go to college so they never have to have the loans that I did.
0.0	0.0930424193548	How do I know this?
0.0	0.509789739799	I voted against the war in Iraq because I listened very carefully to what President Bush and Vice President Cheney had to say and I didn't believe them.
0.0	0.11460462209	I'm president -- look, I've done it once.
0.0	0.464543640955	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.153421274506	But many, many people did.
0.0	0.784024139633	I believe that we need to cut these taxes down, we need to be on a roadmap to balancing the budget, and we need to send power, money, and influence, the welfare department, the education department, job training, infrastructure, Medicaid, all of that out of Washington back to the states so we can run these programs from where we live to the top, not a one size fits all mentality that they have in Washington.
0.0	0.155445041673	But I think I'll go back to building buildings if it doesn't work out.
0.0	0.184681679734	Maria -- Maria, what you were talking about just now is called corporate inversion.
1.0	0.992314657803	If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world -- and we double tax, as you know.
0.0	0.154936345863	They can't even make a deal.
0.0	0.117396863402	Where did that spirit come from in America?
0.0	0.0566797300267	And -- and I guess I can -- can frame it another way.
0.0	0.203864724697	We are nineteen trillion dollars -- our country's a mess and we can't let all these people come into our country and break our borders.
0.0	0.472090574793	I never said that.
0.0	0.0798649622392	And Carl -- Carl, I'm not finished yet.
0.0	0.210380252065	His first election and his re-election.
0.0	0.158604431686	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.1351888594	I was ready to lead, but I wasn't ready to run.
0.0	0.240098216895	My father was born in Italy, and shortly after he was born my grandfather immigrated to this country.
0.0	0.274980256656	It would not necessitate us raising any taxes.
0.0	0.255377713313	Friends of mine are ordering Kamatsu (ph) tractors now because they've de-valued the yen to such an extent that you can't buy a Caterpillar tractor.
1.0	0.990611007894	You used to say that you were in favor of birthright citizenship, now you say that you are against it.
0.0	0.520950027099	I am very proud, if my memory is not correct -- I think I am -- that I have a lifetime -- and I've been in Congress a few years -- a lifetime 100 percent pro-choice voting record.
0.0	0.249691928059	Two quick responses.
0.0	0.062151389363	It's not only a problem here.
0.0	0.404806968227	A lot has happened in nine months.
0.0	0.149662108686	And kind of -- that's what I see our campaign is about right now.
0.0	0.40862008801	The time to turn the page is now.
0.0	0.187091157053	This is the only time I've had a chance, let me finish.
0.0	0.0467331569073	Thank you.
0.0	0.164449217795	(inaudible), the great majority of Republicans and Americans believe in a hopeful future.
0.0	0.183140277542	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.916120548002	I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years, and by the way, one of the members of that committee was Senator Strom Thurmond from South Carolina.
0.0	0.153905477771	Let people play, who cares?
0.0	0.769339239784	The reality is four times as many blacks get arrested for marijuana.
0.0	0.404494947563	Well, Senator, look, I think we're in vigorous agreement here.
0.0	0.20102485431	This is why, fundamentally, we have to take our government back.
0.0	0.227673381878	I'm the only person on this stage who's done that and we will get it done as President of the United States.
1.0	0.904088893315	Later that year, in 2004, John Kerry ran for president missing close to 60 to 70 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.35499845986	The biggest tax increase happened under the watch of Barack Obama, and spending's gone up.
0.0	0.338471216697	We're against your policies.
0.0	0.176225651217	And as president of the United States, it's all about communication, folks.
1.0	0.797632655551	You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don't agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements.
0.0	0.274997960053	And I'll tell you what, Donald, you -- you very kindly just a moment ago offered me the V.P.
0.0	0.124205394895	Wait a minute, who in their 16th month?
0.0	0.170011867452	That's why I've entered this race, and I think I have the experience to do it.
0.0	0.245644272799	No one is a socialist.
0.0	0.70191753987	I stood yesterday with 75 construction workers.
0.0	0.108999980828	We have to get back into looking at what's causing it.
0.0	0.223592312575	You gotta be patient.
0.0	0.26073186614	We need to make sure that we do everything across all kinds of energy: natural gas, oil, absolutely.
0.0	0.127684713448	They shouldn't be going to Europe.
0.0	0.149271362687	(LAUGHTER) I'll tell you what.
0.0	0.202643632172	You want to fix Medicare?
0.0	0.167875705284	It's not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.139877465005	If I could just respond.
0.0	0.27637425395	It goes away.
0.0	0.156279415905	We'll go to the Congress.
0.0	0.173106048827	I'm going to go to the commanders and say give me a plan to win.
0.0	0.291486241109	Let me tell you, Donald Trump would be a president every day of the week and twice on Sunday, rather than Hillary.
0.0	0.111036760844	You are working at McDonald's?
0.0	0.30942393155	If you looking at what happened with Boeing and if you look at what happened with so many companies that deal -- so we don't have an equal playing field.
0.0	0.57040239784	We have to obey the laws.
0.0	0.374071809375	We came back from the dead.
0.0	0.100391494785	And that's really a theme of a lot of the things that I'm talking about.
0.0	0.219291138529	Why didn't they turn those two people in so that you wouldn't have had all the death?
0.0	0.261099920085	They look around for gun-free zones.
0.0	0.0327049686998	And we got to fight like crazy so people can think the American dream still exists, because it does, with rising wages, with full employment and with everybody in America -- and I mean everybody in America -- having an opportunity to realize the American dream of having a better life than their mother and their father.
0.0	0.312524982315	My name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.508167258873	And it is difficult to in any way argue with the goal that we both share.

0.0	0.234182490977	We need to reform Social Security.

0.0	0.189262713604	... first of all, let me just tell you something -- and you know, because you just saw the numbers yourself -- NBC Wall Street Journal just came out with a poll -- headline: Trump way up, Cruz going down.
0.0	0.84900879854	Marco's top tax rate is 35 percent.

0.0	0.407717613728	But I do hope that in years to come, just as occurred with Cuba, 10, 20 years ago, people would say, reach normalized relations with Cuba.
0.0	0.270054203774	There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies.
0.0	0.311815335118	(APPLAUSE) This is not a cage match.
0.0	0.533103318903	One principle, for example, we've got to embrace is on immigration.
0.0	0.378333782861	What I did in New York was bring people together, an overwhelmingly Democratic state.
0.0	0.350244292799	I mean, you have great constitutional lawyers that say you can't run.
0.0	0.446413809309	And when it comes to the issues that are really on the front lines as to whether we're going to have equal pay, paid family leave, some opportunity for, you know, women to go as far as their hard work and talent take them, I think that we still have some barriers to knock down, which is why that's at the core of my campaign.
0.0	0.09983278842	There are lids on people's aspirations.
0.0	0.111045550663	But they can't get along.
0.0	0.615499868234	We now have a 73,000-page tax code.
0.0	0.292051290055	So I have nothing at all critical of him.
0.0	0.279565972813	That's what he is.
0.0	0.0457321759966	And I think when you give low-income kids -- African-American, white, Latino kids -- the opportunities to get their lives together, they are not going to end up in jail.
0.0	0.18987351386	is exactly the leadership we need in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.423926957083	Regulations in this country are out of control, especially the Employment Prevention Agency, the EPA, and all of the rules they continue to impose on our economy and hurting us.
0.0	0.139258440794	But the idea that you can't -- that you're just gonna grow your way out of this -- I have a plan to grow the economy at 4 percent, but you're gonna have to make adjustments for both Medicare and Social Security.
0.0	0.128282477649	Let me conclude by just saying this.
0.0	0.0633771557222	Japan, the same thing.
0.0	0.0215397746127	Whether it's welfare reform and getting something back for the hard-earned taxpayers; whether it's engaging in Pentagon reform and taking on the big contractors that were charging thousands of dollars for hammers and screw drivers and ripping us off; or whether it's taking on the special interests in the nursing home industry in Ohio, so that mom and dad can have the ability to stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.
0.0	0.580002634029	I'm the only one on this stage who has a plan that's actually reduced -- actually going to reduce immigration.
0.0	0.517324262329	The first speech I gave in this campaign back in April was about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration.
0.0	0.186908940206	So, we are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we have to root out in our society.
0.0	0.650556192769	We took a loan against our assets to invest it in that campaign to defend ourselves against those attacks.
0.0	0.14602183985	This is an interesting point when you talk about immigration.
0.0	0.100267238273	It's "give me options on how I can make it harder for law-abiding people to buy guns."
0.0	0.53995312775	If we elect Hillary Clinton, the next four years will be worse than the last eight, and our children will be the first Americans ever to inherit a diminished country.
0.0	0.596889499967	Yes, I thought about running four years ago.
0.0	0.338944143537	Give Bernie Sanders credit.
0.0	0.0777297368243	It should be what are your substantive positions...
0.0	0.473054998585	Your prosecute criminals.
0.0	0.232217482594	But then his poll numbers tanked.
0.0	0.237857012411	I want to ask you: Are you fed up with how Washington taxes you?
0.0	0.65707659685	If you saw that blimp that got cut loose from Maryland today, it's a perfect example of government.
0.0	0.176240940695	Look, we are fighting for every vote that we can get from women, from men, straight, gay, African-Americans, Latinos, Asian-Americans.
0.0	0.263550586269	That debate reflected a debate between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks.
0.0	0.280226289684	I didn't find it offensive at all.
0.0	0.15550281607	Thank you for that question.
0.0	0.246715114495	And based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don't add up, and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now.
0.0	0.0994388657971	If you're a Washington lobbyist, if you make your money in and around Washington, things are doing great.
0.0	0.225759118896	No.
0.0	0.117116425896	Well, I am going to answer your question, Neil.
0.0	0.111684743289	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.432342279769	It puts us on a level, even playing field, which brings jobs here at home...
0.0	0.154729882816	Come with me to Iraq and Afghanistan, folks.
0.0	0.361722440299	No, I oppose it because you're taking money from the entitlement and then spending it immediately on other items.
0.0	0.726783693029	You find me a Democrat -- you find me a Democrat that will cut spending ten dollars?
0.0	0.121869824015	You know, that's so simple.
0.0	0.0284718829026	In my case, whether it's health care, or getting us to debt-free tuition, or moving us toward paid family leave, I have been very specific about where I would raise the money, how much it would cost, and how I would move this agenda forward.
0.0	0.426269581401	This isn't the governments money.
0.0	0.0671226230897	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.116650039071	Look, here is the reality, folks.
0.0	0.0466548219615	Our next president...
0.0	0.108844652016	I applaud Secretary Kerry and the president for trying to put together this agreement.
0.0	0.305550020834	I think it was a mistake to expand Medicaid everywhere in Ohio and across the country.
0.0	0.145674151786	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.1459842484	But let me go back to something that's very important.
0.0	0.639337809786	However, we saved 80,000 jobs and we went on to grow to 160,000 jobs, and scores of technology companies literally went out of business -- like Gateway -- taking all their jobs with them.
0.0	0.00637311187185	And Mexico's going to pay for the wall because Mexico -- I love the Mexican people; I respect the Mexican leaders -- but the leaders are much sharper, smarter and more cunning than our leaders.
0.0	0.165303169149	But the issue for us is to have a Congress that stands up and says not only no, but "Hell no" to this money going to a regime that is going to use it for terror, Susan Rice has said that, and we need to stand up and strongly and clearly tell the ayatollah that -- whoever the next president of the United States is going to be, and I'll promise you, if it's me, the first thing that I will do is tear up that agreement with Iran.
0.0	0.192143898205	I believe I can get the money that I need by taxing the wealthy, by closing loopholes, the things that we are way overdue for doing.
0.0	0.281953259571	Because we can't just save the American Dream, we can expand it to reach more people, and change more lives than ever before.
0.0	0.047711825284	Or, are you going to deal with the problem by saying, I'm going to give people who've done well in this country less benefit on the backend.
0.0	0.14612167131	They're taking money from Social Security and they're going to spend it on the military and they're going to spend it on domestic spending.
0.0	0.20910037765	It's poor people and middle class.
0.0	0.243216019247	We have a serious problem with, as you know, with radical Islam.
0.0	0.345426453532	That is not protected religious belief.
0.0	0.188250910673	This is a remarkable and horrifying fact.
0.0	0.125375145423	Listen, I want to just comment.
0.0	0.937282170133	We used to have 16 workers for one retiree, now you have three workers for one retiree.
0.0	0.394789060321	... in addition to that, we go ahead and we take the oil from them, their source of revenue.
0.0	0.525531718778	So you know, I had to report results every 90 days in excruciating detail.
1.0	0.991805656354	They don't want to pay 35 percent tax on the way back.
0.0	0.626665840325	I agree, however, it doesn't go far enough, because what it focuses on are the big banks, which Senator Sanders has talked about a lot, for good reason.
1.0	0.902291693443	It is a simple flat tax where for individuals, a family of four pays nothing on the first $36,000.
0.0	0.399258319281	They have a sophisticated understanding of our legal immigration system and we now have an obligation to ensure that they are not able to use that system against us.
0.0	0.240702373792	That was not, as I understand it, the secretary's position.
0.0	0.0898212492162	And I'm going to tell you, that it -- I'm going to suggest to you here tonight, that you can't do on the job training.
0.0	0.24892585276	We don't need to raise taxes to get this done.
0.0	0.263942677515	You know, every election we hear a lot of talk.
0.0	0.551340947201	Under my plan, no business, big or small, will pay more than 25 percent flat rate on their business income.
0.0	0.2886673871	Remember, we have 645 federal agencies and sub-agencies.
0.0	0.144623513869	And the idea that this negotiation -- I will tell you one thing.
0.0	0.252911995048	I am, but people are upset, and they're upset for a reason about the future of this country.
0.0	0.400225374512	The student loan problem has been created by government.
0.0	0.125212940292	And what I have concluded is that the best policy is to get rid of all government subsidies, and get the government out of our lives, and let people rise and fall based on how good they are.
0.0	0.217512189577	Let me tell you, everybody, when they say they want to give it to you for free, keep your hands on your wallets because they're coming to you to pay for it.
0.0	0.360170396557	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.221156343959	I will do so in a way that will bring people together.
0.0	0.428006566217	in particular.
0.0	0.452406572476	We have to eliminate the sequester, rebuild our military in a way that makes it clear that we're back in the game.
0.0	0.451225270189	... that he tried to take credit for four years later.
0.0	0.192016628197	He is a good man.
0.0	0.0964357950054	And I think together we will make progress.
0.0	0.444034275238	Last I heard we lived in a democratic society.
0.0	0.579321208455	We have a country of laws.
0.0	0.0880575962795	And secondly, when you talk about me being on the board of Lehman Brothers, I wasn't on the board of Lehman Brothers.
0.0	0.483834360301	They worked hard to provide us the chance at a better life.
0.0	0.303702049047	And if you're going to leave this to Hillary Clinton, the person who gave us this foreign policy, the architect of it, and you're going to give her another four years, that's why I'm speaking out as strongly as I am about that.
0.0	0.0663346555728	And Lehman Brothers started it all.
0.0	0.22869326744	When you look at raising the debt limit, it should be leverage to try to reform government.
0.0	0.365499368365	You know, that's what the PC culture is all about, and it's destroying this nation.
0.0	0.317992334503	I think that is the real key here.
0.0	0.0690058977576	But, we can't rest.
0.0	0.162336328864	We would still have LGBT people who get married on Saturday and get fired on Monday.
1.0	0.400773369387	They cite Obamacare.
0.0	0.100298654995	But, let me tell you who not to blame.
0.0	0.302507385377	I would say that I would and I have a permit, which is very unusual in New York -- a permit to carry.
0.0	0.627056884921	We owned a liquor store, restaurant, bar and we lived in the back.
0.0	0.427492391085	That the Ayatollah is a radical jihadist who really means it when he chants, "Death to America, death to Israel."
1.0	0.715422270438	And we'll save a trillion dollars over the next 10 years.
0.0	0.131853771469	I can govern by bringing people together.
0.0	0.23958164558	But this is nothing new.
0.0	0.122973847964	When I'm president of the United States we are getting rid of Obamacare and we are rebuilding our military.
0.0	0.110660902086	They are devaluing -- it's so impossible for -- you look at Caterpillar Tractor and what's happening with Caterpillar and Kamatsu (ph).
0.0	0.282019688851	We hear actually a lot of good intentions.
0.0	0.237930415301	It was.
0.0	0.0314346109978	It would bring the money back into the United States to help build jobs by American companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about.
1.0	0.978590749547	Ronald Regan opposed the value tax because he said it was a way to blindfold the people, so the true cost of government was not there there for them.
0.0	0.29714610914	It's not the evil rich people.
0.0	0.135064340157	Both Donald and Jeb have good points, and there is a middle ground.
0.0	0.214642479888	Now, on that tariff -- here's what I'm saying, China -- they send their goods and we don't tax it -- they do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.157867811184	My state is doing great across the board.
0.0	0.462032141824	That's not the role of the government.
0.0	0.133987187873	It turns out some dot wasn't connected, and so the first thing we have to do is make sure that everyone and every responsible agency is attuned to all of these possibilities and symptoms.
0.0	0.22233537493	When I am president of the United States, I'm going to side with Ronald Regan on this and not Nancy Pelosi and we are not having a vat tax.
0.0	0.124270610693	Right there, right next to the plant.
0.0	0.0668159586638	But we have a serious problem.
0.0	0.0592946147099	I think we need to be very careful with tariffs, and here's why.
0.0	0.0930455139094	But I like to be unpredictable so that people don't know exactly... (LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.174696877669	Well, you know, I think, from a historical point of view, somebody with my background, somebody with my views, somebody who has spent his entire life taking on the big money interests, I think a Sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment, as well.
0.0	0.155378518588	I like that.
0.0	0.868785222232	I have a proven record of success, 32 years in business, and 8 years as Governor of the state of Florida.
0.0	0.106463623351	And for good cause.
0.0	0.050870256032	What a president of the United States has got to do -- and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility -- is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe, that we work with allies around the world to protect...
0.0	0.351068555206	I will continue to have tremendous admiration and respect for Governor Bush.
0.0	0.302286075832	Now Maria, listen.
0.0	0.0467331569073	Thank you.
0.0	0.259645044241	About Medicare?
0.0	0.06093055924	I think it's -- yeah, I think it's a one-two punch.
0.0	0.613921869427	Everybody said it was going to be three hours, three and a half, including them, and in about two minutes I renegotiated it so we can get the hell out of here.
0.0	0.454522556159	Lots of people will say lots of different things about me in this campaign and others, but the one thing they've never said about me is that I'm misunderstood.
0.0	0.169931000352	I like it.
0.0	0.544442820303	There is no money in the Medicare account.
0.0	0.28095529738	Like rich kids, they deserve to get a free education.
0.0	0.177876223726	I would hold a Camp David summit with our Arab allies, not to talk them into this lousy deal with Iran, but to say to them, "what is it that you need to defeat ISIL?"
0.0	0.10490439926	Alright.
0.0	0.397957870121	I have no clue whether the federal government is the proper place, my instinct is to say, hell no, just about everything about the federal government.
0.0	0.350159211018	Could I -- could I bring something up here, because I'm a constituent of the senator and I helped him and I expected that he would do constituent service, which means that he shows up to work.
0.0	0.487984528057	When I was 21, my mom died.
0.0	0.679898986254	This debate needs to be about the men and women across this country that are struggling on a daily basis to provide for their families the better future that we've always said this country is all about.
0.0	0.186347526596	I will tell you that.
0.0	0.152654914086	We're nowhere close to a balanced budget or fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.0498499580593	Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well.
0.0	0.0928753616829	And you talk so much that nobody can ever keep up with what you're saying is accurate or not.
0.0	0.095520761522	I'd like to just mention something about my tax plan, and how it relates to the discussion...
0.0	0.311698722094	She wouldn't just be a disaster, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being commander in chief of the United States.
0.0	0.287661981193	The better way of dealing with this -- the better way of dealing with this is recognizing that there are people in, you know, the -- Islamic terrorists inside, embedded in refugee populations.
0.0	0.337265240709	That is our government today.
0.0	0.145623552834	Do we still have values and principles?
0.0	0.0528923081361	Do you remember when he ran for president of the United States, and he was a candidate, and he went and said, "These Americans with traditional values, they are bitter people, and they cling to their guns and to their religion."
0.0	0.820834647309	We're going to combine all commercial activity in business into one place in the tax code and charge it 15 percent, which is going to suddenly make us competitive with the rest of the world.
1.0	0.971010307339	Americans haven't had a raise in 15 years.
0.0	0.293546487771	And if I am president and we get our hands on him, he is standing trial for treason.
0.0	0.0299366596161	Divisive and with no vision.
0.0	0.289502897069	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.0427989250174	And so that was his explanation.
0.0	0.465727274189	That's 13,000 miles.
0.0	0.156209303172	But getting back to Martha's question about how we end dependency, do we have to have a cultural change?
0.0	0.489080666914	No, they don't like he beats the rest of the field, because they want me.
0.0	0.25348889183	I'm running for president because there is no way we can elect Hillary Clinton to continue the policies of Barack Obama.
0.0	0.615249744974	But, the real issue, I think, that the Senator is injecting into this is that if you had a Super PAC, like President Obama has, which now says it wants to support me.
0.0	0.190030675823	I hope you will make a decision soon on this.
0.0	0.533938226281	This is money that people have confiscated out of their paychecks.
0.0	0.634779339819	We own a home four blocks away from the place that I grew up in.
0.0	0.0472021108374	That is important.
0.0	0.261817583108	Well, this is going to be a show me, don't tell me election.
0.0	0.142919953733	We need to come together as a country because we have to realize that America is great, not from the top-down.
0.0	0.574637931567	I would note, just for a historic aside, somebody told me earlier today we've had like 200 presidential primary debates, and this is the first time there have been a majority of women on the stage.
0.0	0.146929023303	I know we have a president who wants to do whatever he wants to do, and take his pen and his phone and just tell everybody what he thinks is best.
0.0	0.16642256448	So he had to leave the Situation Room after hearing from the small group advising him and he had to make that decision.
0.0	0.169517071316	Why?
0.0	0.260323378168	Well, I'm glad you asked that, Maria.
0.0	0.625990829136	But Maria, radical Islamic terrorism was not invented 24 months ago; 24 months ago, we had Al Qaida.
0.0	0.256052315335	The president of the United States admitting that he's weakening our government's position, our foreign policy standing, because he can't control spending in D.C..
0.0	0.183906290207	Why is that?
0.0	0.233570939545	This guy is a petulant child.
0.0	0.215099076439	Well, if the law would change, yeah.
0.0	0.112997614616	I'm asking people to support me because I think I'm the most qualified, experienced, and ready person to be the president and the commander- in-chief.
0.0	0.12052579232	So you should go out, get a declaratory judgment, let the courts decide.
0.0	0.10181449209	I can see why people are angry and scared, because this president has created a condition where our national security has weakened dramatically.
0.0	0.129350304687	It's not fear and terror, it's reality.
1.0	0.999988046367	Who denies that African-American youth unemployment, real, is over 50 percent.
0.0	0.0495932868121	There is no other description of it.
0.0	0.172342048414	Not everybody remembers that.
0.0	0.559414624372	It is time for Republicans in D.C. to fight.
0.0	0.110624480366	That's the difference.
0.0	0.365795383051	Enough on fantasy football.
0.0	0.092075076704	And you know what?
0.0	0.4603105151	Yeah, I would go, first of all, one step further in this description of Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.238774396957	We don't win.
0.0	0.299780420609	Now, let me just be clear, John.
0.0	0.247903236456	You know, in our country, there are a lot of people who feel as though they just don't have the power.
0.0	0.26974688136	But realistically, even if they do, the money is flowing.
0.0	0.167828335253	And I do carry on occasion, sometimes a lot.
0.0	0.50569178151	I did it as the chairman of the Budget Committee, working with Senator Domenici.
0.0	0.673763756696	Martha, we got a lot of politicians that will kiss babies, cut ribbons, do whatever it takes to be popular.
0.0	0.646249323479	Have been ever since I was in the Senate.
0.0	0.869128018696	Marco stood today, standing on this stage Marco supports legalization and citizenship for 12 million illegals.
0.0	0.198134394023	We're going dark when it comes to detecting the next attack.
0.0	0.50713428997	First of all, John got lucky with a thing called fracking, OK?
0.0	0.208931442844	And the fact of the matter is if we give them a mission and we don't tie their hands behind their back, they can get it accomplished.
0.0	0.108550263965	But also where it's affordable, solar, wind in Iowa has become very affordable and it makes sense.
0.0	0.659831267593	We will use those proceeds, a hundred billion a year, to invest in rebuilding our infrastructure.
0.0	0.251965930616	Yes, I'm going to do away with that.
0.0	0.11498234935	... replacing dependency with opportunity.
0.0	0.105639885527	You just want to...
0.0	0.28760727546	He is -- this president is undermining the constitutional basis of this government.
0.0	0.297709596478	Well, yes, indeed.
0.0	0.184068576182	Here's the deal, Chris is totally right.
0.0	0.207406492945	And when you have insider information, which apparently has been the case, where people use that information and use big data to try to take advantage of it, there has to be some regulation.
0.0	0.0465245329377	With all the candidates, why me?
0.0	0.165623728144	We need a leader who will lead the resurgence of this great nation and unlock its potential once again.
0.0	0.256967971722	And also, I've been tested in a way no one else has.
0.0	0.236812642468	So I believe as president I will look very carefully about unintended consequences.
0.0	0.310388505379	So, yes, I do believe that when we talk about public education in America, today, in a rapidly changing world, we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities.
0.0	0.207689325038	And I just want to say, you know, last week we released our tax plan.
0.0	0.285717177965	And the Obama-Clinton economy has left behind the working men and women of this country.
0.0	0.14660505179	He was the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan.
0.0	0.263053345103	People have worked their entire lives.
0.0	0.353686487182	... believe me the world is peanuts by comparison.
0.0	0.385431685832	Part of the reason why it hasn't risen because sometimes we're not giving people the skills they need.
0.0	0.339213433232	They come from another country and they're immediately sent out.
0.0	0.871292330264	If a person lives in a seven room house, does the government get to say you don't need seven rooms, we're going to take two of them away?
0.0	0.300310337155	The wages that high school graduates receive today are significantly less, whether you are white or black, than they used to be.
0.0	0.629170066415	Yeah, again, as I said, we're raising a family in the 21st century and it's one of the reasons why my tax plan is a pro- family tax plan.
0.0	0.555877975401	Well, Secretary Clinton, you're not in the White House yet.
0.0	0.564108605094	I've heard them talk about deporting 10 or 11 -- people here from this country out of this country, splitting families.
0.0	0.197470582448	You can't do that to the party.
1.0	0.540506586043	Now, on the floor of the Congress, the Washington establishment from both parties puts forward a bill that will explode the deficit.
0.0	0.360170396557	I said temporarily.
0.0	0.425837066272	My point is this: I won two landslide elections, I made big changes.
0.0	0.0511088940865	And, for those of us who are serious enough to run for president, think long and hard why we're here, and hopefully you'll know we're not here for ourselves.
0.0	0.409782590137	I will show you what they do to women.
0.0	0.0808759924414	Yeah.
0.0	0.232435939755	My father used to say, "Johnny, we never -- we don't hate the rich.
0.0	0.258530217028	Not keeping the government open.
0.0	0.313495186085	My name was mentioned.
0.0	0.440727111929	She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video.
0.0	0.330739905828	Is there an area for a safety net?
0.0	0.158604431686	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.293956471109	And she and I looked at the same evidence coming from the Bush administration regarding Iraq.
0.0	0.175181546177	Everybody knows that.
0.0	0.303143032744	Everyone up here tonight that's talking about reforms, I think and I know for myself I speak to this, we're all talking about reforms for future generations.
0.0	0.0143841648915	If you're worried about the world being on fire, you're worried about how we're going to use our military, you're worried about strengthening our military and you're worried most of all about keeping your homes and your families safe and secure, you cannot give Hillary Clinton a third term of Barack Obama's leadership.
0.0	0.657279246955	Focus on the diseases that are costing us the trillions of dollars.
0.0	0.317299397772	Yes, they have to stop being the main state sponsor of terrorism.
1.0	0.965893745462	1.5 million jobs created during the worst economic time this country has had since the Great Depression while the rest of the country lost 400,000 jobs.
0.0	0.20057047562	I'm looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.960840128164	I built a net worth of way over $10 billion, and I have done it four times out of hundreds.
0.0	0.201147568525	Unintended consequences.
0.0	0.315011731779	We have to work with NATO to protect Eastern Europe against any kind of Russian aggression.
0.0	0.335492377873	If you're running for president of the United States and you do not understand that we cannot defend this nation without more of our soldiers over there, you are not ready for this job.
0.0	0.138362231685	So...
0.0	0.532564906544	But view is those trade policies have enabled corporate America to shut down in this country, throw millions of people out on the street.
0.0	0.105083001282	(inaudible).
0.0	0.106443532309	And when we live by those laws and we treat everybody equally under the law, that's when people feel good about being Americans.
0.0	0.291579071122	I believe we are on the path to doing that.
1.0	0.785628154959	And Iranian wise guys having guns to their heads.
0.0	0.471588698008	She actually ran against one of my friends and our head of public safety.
0.0	0.704790027316	I'm the only one on this stage that has a plan that would create jobs, cut taxes, balance the budget and can get it done because I'm realistic.
0.0	0.229447073357	The problem is we never get it done.
0.0	0.262409831997	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.158904290115	There are other racial discrepancies.
0.0	0.427475879228	King Abdullah of Jordan, a man I've known for a long time, has been asking for bombs and materiel.
0.0	0.271570084661	They're going to end up in the productive economy, which is where we want them.

0.0	0.0391554365526	Think about that.
0.0	0.47677988471	Look, the -- the simple fact is that my plan actually gives the middle class the greatest break: $2,000 per family.
0.0	0.722565505807	Well, and specifically to Medicare, Becky, because 85 percent of the cost of Medicare is chronic disease.

0.0	0.118260766123	It's the only way to level the playing field between big and powerful and small and powerless.
0.0	0.367712227509	They are much more than that.

0.0	0.169329962278	We have ISIS and al Qaeda attacking us.
0.0	0.118817256466	... with what Marco is saying is that it takes too long, they're sucking us dry and it takes too long.
0.0	0.378820475561	We took it away from the NSA, it was a bad decision by the president.
0.0	0.390093456637	The rest of the world is moving away from us towards other alliances because we are weak.

0.0	0.300873069291	On the issue of Barack Obama, Barack Obama does not believe that America is a great global power.

0.0	0.260381156831	You're welcome.
0.0	0.344334759204	John Harwood, there's a bigger issue here.
0.0	0.173918847639	And I want to just suggest to you.
0.0	0.604427380209	These folks, CNBC, they had it down at three, three and a half hours.
0.0	0.0834463173966	Or how about Boeing right here within a mile?
0.0	0.0790256388554	A lot of interesting issues have come together.
0.0	0.291851678688	I know what it's like to owe that money, and we've worked hard.
0.0	0.227526730089	We will work with our Sunni allies.

0.0	0.640757658546	We've saved billions of dollars.

0.0	0.409230766364	If there's an act of violence in America, his immediate answer before he even knows the facts is gun control.
0.0	0.168562266585	I have yet to see a proposal that you're describing that the -- raising the cap would apply to passive income.
0.0	0.71400651988	That's what they do, whether it's the San Bernardino attack or if it's these tragedies that take place, I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is.
0.0	0.60183635289	If a soldier has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.923187737096	I just read today in the New York Times, $250,000 for a 30 second ad.
0.0	0.294974011595	And worse -- worse yet, to be honest with you, Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster.
0.0	0.0561483550998	And here in Wisconsin, I want to reiterate: We've got to stand up for unions and working people who have done it before...
0.0	0.582366683721	They want a political revolution in which millions of Americans stand up, come together, not let the Trumps of the world divide us, and say, you know what, in this great country, we need a government that represents all of us, not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.
0.0	0.0737355716911	What we have to do is end over-policing in African- American neighborhoods.
0.0	0.253573261339	Not trustworthy.

0.0	0.1730051652	Well, Neil, I'm glad we're focusing on the important topics of the evening.
0.0	0.679931275309	Got 70 votes in the United States Senate.
0.0	0.396001420055	That is very different than talking about specific action for regime change, which I did not support.
0.0	0.415392267126	It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are.
0.0	0.318248143016	At least he's honest enough to call himself a socialist.
0.0	0.366870293361	We cannot be the world's policeman.
1.0	0.853998907554	And I've done it when I was in Washington when we had a balanced budget; had four years of balanced budgets; paid down a half-trillion of debt.
0.0	0.247568427883	... that, having been in the trenches fighting for this, I believe strongly we have to guarantee health care.
1.0	0.897522639394	Everybody voted for it wanting to see Libya move toward democracy, of course we all wanted to do that.
0.0	0.330855991854	We need to get back in the game as it relates to our Arab nations.
0.0	0.517993836167	Hillary Clinton lies about Benghazi, she lies about e- mails.
0.0	0.132859608488	I've watched to see people say that we should dismantle Medicare and Medicaid and leave the senior citizens out -- out in the -- in the cold.
0.0	0.404511712329	Yes, does Wall Street and big financial interests, along with drug companies, insurance companies, big oil, all of it, have too much influence?
0.0	0.289982791968	Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, they're no better.
1.0	0.0464592571113	Believe me, that is why Ohio is doing well.
1.0	0.929881061428	I would note that Art Laffer, Ronald Reagan's chief economic adviser, has written publicly, that my simple flat tax is the best tax plan of any of the individuals on this stage cause it produces economic growth, it raises wages and it helps everyone from the very poorest to the very richest.
0.0	0.145805665003	And when America does not lead, the world is a dangerous and a tragic place.
0.0	0.233919954583	And the world's financial system is on the verge of collapse.
0.0	0.147504641453	Because when government gets big and powerful, the big feel like they need to get even bigger to deal with all that power, and meanwhile, the small and the powerless -- in this case, 1,590 community banks -- go out of business.
0.0	0.250015732257	And we are going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fall.
0.0	0.115574361957	I would hope that we could all agree that we are sick and tired of seeing videos on television of unarmed people, often African-Americans, shot by police officers.
0.0	0.219379126493	And the last piece is this.
0.0	0.68955954719	Now, I find it rather amazing, because I happen to believe that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country.
0.0	0.378790322318	I've set forth very specific plans about how to get costs down, especially prescription drug costs.
0.0	0.28496895265	Terrorism is on the run, China, Russia is advancing their agenda at warp speed, and we pull back.
0.0	0.229946321199	This is a bad deal.
0.0	0.133341447296	But in terms of shutting down the government, I don't think President Obama should choose to shut down the government simply to send taxpayer dollars to this group that has been caught, I believe, breaking the law, but also offending our values and our ethics.
0.0	0.285782619301	And his explanation -- he said, "look, I'm from New York, that's what we believe in New York.
0.0	0.106236537087	You gotta be -- stick with it, and all that.
0.0	0.0467331569073	Thank you.
0.0	0.446751045409	John?
0.0	0.258265816965	The only way we're going to defund Planned Parenthood is have a pro-life president.

0.0	0.113891955562	The Koch Brothers have a very clear political agenda.
0.0	0.5	Bill, I defeated Mario Cuomo.
0.0	0.255141310297	But here's the real key.
0.0	0.199400392888	It's not that hard.
0.0	0.0795370108083	And, you know, we have a whole variety of things that they can do and they can do these things simultaneously.
0.0	0.342681720569	If we were to expand Medicaid, for every uninsured person we would cover, we'd kick more than one person out of private insurance or remove their opportunity to get private insurance.
0.0	0.21768183318	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you better get rid of the SuperPacs because they causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that have been made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.409002193359	We have to provide the NATO support to back up the mission that is going on.

0.0	0.578209736837	I opposed and oppose legalization and citizenship.
0.0	0.242129260295	First and foremost, this issue has to be now more than anything else about keeping America safe.
0.0	0.26535550458	I'm aware of that.
0.0	0.341346376905	And you better get rid of them because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.152698110549	He does great.

0.0	0.031872351119	Creativity.
0.0	0.0624195376239	We will rebuild the military to make sure that it is a solid force, not to be the world's policeman, but to make sure that in a peaceful world, people know that the United States is there to take care of our own national interests and take care of our allies.
0.0	0.129944551419	Let me tell you, if we don't get this election right, there may be no turning back for America.
0.0	0.341963484573	Well, this is one of the reasons why Tom Perkins and I had disagreements in the boardroom, Becky.

0.0	0.112930952363	Good question, but I want to tell you, my great concern is that we are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job.
0.0	0.47244167128	Donald Trump actually seized on it when he talked about immigration.

0.0	0.766545633393	Well, first of all, I didn't say that the rate would be 10 percent.
0.0	0.125962218603	And I said, "Didn't you resent America for not letting you be with your father in those formative and very threatening years?"
0.0	0.442866339595	We're running surpluses.
0.0	0.294141430239	In fact, frankly, he's complaining about the fact that we're losing some of the most talented people.

0.0	0.508361426674	But if you want someone who has a proven, effective leadership, that was a governor of a state, that transformed the culture there, elect me so I can fight for the American people and change the culture in Washington, D.C.

0.0	0.219203150205	I got that.
0.0	0.715007347827	I was the chairman of the National Commission on Homeland Security and Terrorism for the United States for five years.
0.0	0.327877456563	What we have got to do is make it clear that any police officer who breaks the law will, in fact, be held accountable.
0.0	0.169408549742	In addition to that...
0.0	0.090903613725	I'm asking folks not just to join my campaign, but join a cause.
0.0	0.17683203083	Number -- and that is important for you to know.
0.0	0.225749483276	First of all, I'd like to recognize Governor Haley for her incredible leadership in the aftermath of the --
0.0	0.268995840085	They lost a lot of money, everybody said it couldn't be done.
0.0	0.318257296994	And you combine that with a plan to make manufacturing -- this country number one in manufacturing, you've got someone who's going to help revitalize and give hope to America, the place -- the place is that is the most hopeless today.
0.0	0.112404694123	That is not what America is supposed to be about.
0.0	0.148649797871	He doesn't meet -- here's the difference.
0.0	0.133081357274	The American people have rejected your agenda and now you're trying to go around it.
0.0	0.241935180546	I cannot tell you how much our nation is threatened and how we need a commander in chief who understands the threats to this nation.
0.0	0.119751099615	And I give you my word, if I am elected president, no service man or service woman will be forced to be on their knees, and any nation that captures our fighting men will feel the full force and fury of the United States of America.
0.0	0.249426523438	This is what's going on.
0.0	0.617829964502	Because only if it's about three pages are you leveling the playing field between the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected who can hire the armies of lawyers and accountants and, yes, lobbyists to help them navigate their way through 73,000 pages.
0.0	0.169327830361	It will never happen because they'll let their currency go up.

0.0	0.119231649919	And, thank you everybody.
0.0	0.206646079479	When you became president, you had a Democratic Congress and a filibuster-proof Democratic Senate.
0.0	0.308204833233	We even had warnings about the Boston Marathon bombers, and yet the dots weren't connected.
0.0	0.353090896214	Secretary Clinton, I do have a disagreement here.
0.0	0.428232683199	I've got a track record.
0.0	0.328636571441	Now, when it mattered, he stood up and took on Wall Street.
0.0	0.172949346103	Under -- under Barack Obama and the proposals of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and others, they've tried it their way, and it has failed miserably.
0.0	0.708472078211	I didn't get a phone call from Bill Clinton before I jumped in the race.
0.0	0.464543640955	And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.
0.0	0.430475409049	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.284689062463	We just can't do it any longer.
0.0	0.210590021519	That is what I could do for the country.
0.0	0.725403247802	We're up 347,000 jobs.
0.0	0.0588073530929	Such a nasty -- such a nasty question, but thank you, Governor.
1.0	0.97499804364	Very few children.
0.0	0.27117640859	I have many friends that deal with China.
0.0	0.0467331569073	Thank you.
0.0	0.355702954751	I don't agree that we're going to occupy and spend another decade or a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.83571464411	In that State of the Union, President Obama didn't so much as mention the 10 sailors that had been captured by Iran.
0.0	0.223221102588	But I recall when Secretary Clinton ran against then-Senator Obama, she was critical of him for suggesting that maybe you want to talk to Iran, that you want to talk to our enemies.
0.0	0.593708867908	If we had guns in California on the other side where the bullets went in the different direction, you wouldn't have 14 or 15 people dead right now.
0.0	0.109528271977	And I will assure you, as the governor of the state of Texas, and as those last four years have shown me, the preparation to be ready to stand on this stage and talk about those monetary policies, those domestic policies, and those foreign policies, Americans are going to see that I am ready to be that individual.
0.0	0.411965780982	We've got to stop this culture of government dependence.
0.0	0.238076430766	We're going to cut Social Security to help you.
0.0	0.372726595345	Do you think that the Chinese, if they had a 45 percent tariff imposed on all their imports wouldn't retaliate and start buying Airbus?
0.0	0.242649442699	You will begin to see jobs created in a robust economy.
0.0	0.369751904681	They are a sophisticated purveyor of propaganda, a celebrator of violence, an instigator of attacks using their online presence.
0.0	0.699585332768	I am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of Vermont from very significant majorities of women.
0.0	0.122948037703	And why?
0.0	0.190580802943	No their not.
0.0	0.137871937353	Well, there is no evidence that they can fix anything in Washington, D.C.
1.0	0.843256643967	If you look at a single mom buying groceries, she sees hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent.
0.0	0.174994432643	It was a back sacrifice, and I have to hand it to Ben.
0.0	0.139098040311	Well, let's just -- let's just follow up on this, because, you know, I've made it very clear that no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail, and because of Dodd-Frank, we now have in law a process that the president, the Federal Reserve, and others can use if any bank poses a systemic risk.
0.0	0.0611329557917	So if we want to pick and choose -- and I certainly do -- people I listen to, people I don't listen to, people I listen to for certain areas, then I think we have to be fair and look at the entire world, because it's a big, complicated world out there.
0.0	0.258073942886	We need a fighter for this country again.
0.0	0.131891837031	...The only way we're going to be morale, the only way we're going to keep our promise to seniors is start by following the first rule we should all follow, which is to look at them, treat them like adults, and tell them the truth.
0.0	0.152071651254	If somebody's already stolen money from you, are you going to give them more?
0.0	0.231587112142	Let me be clear.
0.0	0.321876265755	That's all I'm saying.
0.0	0.229135290023	I know this, I certainly am.
0.0	0.827067457969	President Obama's preparing to send $100 billion or more to the Ayatollah Khamenei.
1.0	0.783536801728	It enabled him -- the president to certify them en masse without mandating meaningful background checks.
0.0	0.0857285156489	That's what we need.
0.0	0.0863546449342	We're going to save Social Security, and we're going to save Medicare.
0.0	0.341512759658	Look, I am deeply concerned about what's happening in every community in America, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths.
0.0	0.109351255305	There was nothing to this birther issue.
0.0	0.304626804184	I will deliver for the American people if I have the privilege of leading this country.
0.0	0.254858808543	Yes, it's very simple.
0.0	0.257587274122	I'm not fighting that.
0.0	0.059804984117	And finally, on health care, why don't we start treating -- keep giving...
0.0	0.716913218696	And I think that the record of the governor of the last 14 years of the 12th largest economy in the world is just the medicine America is looking for.
0.0	0.13207232754	Hardworking immigrant families living in fear, who should be brought out of the shadows so they and their children can have a better future.
0.0	0.317262504908	I'm a Catholic, I believe life begins at conception.
0.0	0.733707252284	And the net result is the middle class has $2,300 less in their pockets than the day that Barack Obama got elected president.
0.0	0.291753217674	The last thing we need is to throw our country into a contentious debate about health care again.
0.0	0.0610400446938	And some of them, I will say, not all, have called me and said, "Donald, thank you very much; you're exposing an unbelievable problem and we have to get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.169356222154	But I -- the struggle of single moms is extraordinary.
0.0	0.263678382763	The government is not supposed to be in every part of our lives, and that is what is causing the problem.
0.0	0.0377128902561	I think we should do both.
0.0	0.668148328608	As you know, he came to Vermont to campaign for me when he was a senator.
0.0	0.514955364118	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.179074969123	But the good news is the next commander-in-chief is standing on this stage.
0.0	0.691642049407	One thing I like to remind people is, back in 2007, Rudy Giuliani was leading the polls for almost a year.
0.0	0.343012599706	I looked at the intelligence.
0.0	0.400005960588	But let me also tell you, one of the issues has got to be the integration of both community and police.
0.0	0.485066133451	People can promise you something, I delivered in the blue state of New York.
1.0	0.940705538882	You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.
0.0	0.368373622065	...is the lowest personal rate any candidate up here has, and what it would also enable us to do is for every citizen to fill out their taxes on a postcard so we can eliminate the IRS.
0.0	0.0598960627622	I am a conservative because I know our values, our principles and our policies --
1.0	0.96179431199	It looked like very few women.
0.0	0.218042406351	We need to re-establish the relationships with the Sunnis.
0.0	0.473599298031	Our legal immigration system from now on has to be merit-based.
0.0	0.0401381129287	That is like shouting "fire" in a crowded theater, and that is illegal, and I would do everything in our power not just to go after those who are here who we know who are here, before they can radicalize other Americans to carry out attacks, and it's not just the ones they've arrested.
0.0	0.890293746727	And I'm the only one up on this stage who back in April put forward a detailed entitlement reform plan that will save over $1 trillion, save Social Security, save Medicare, and avoid this -- avoid what Hillary Rodham Clinton will do to you.
0.0	0.61299203021	And therefore, they don't get the income tax break, but their prices are going to be higher, because the vat tax is embedded in both the prices that business that are charging and in the wages they pay their employees.
1.0	0.876493060277	But I want to -- I want to follow up on something having to do with leadership, because, you know, today Senator Sanders said that President Obama failed the presidential leadership test.
0.0	0.11831483664	You can't have a question.
0.0	0.575980646428	I'm the only person on this stage that actually was involved in the chief architect of balancing the Federal Budget.
0.0	0.0785982318557	So there's a lot of balanced interests.
0.0	0.472090574793	I never said that.
0.0	0.0589040153513	Our friends no longer think we have their back and our enemies no longer fear us, and we're in a much difficult -- we're in a much different position than we should be.
0.0	0.3937770086	In terms of Saudi Arabia, look, my biggest problem with them is they're funding radical clerics through their madrasses.
0.0	0.301564353246	I have talked to some of the young kids with tears rolling down their cheeks, are scared to death that today they may or their parents may be deported.
0.0	0.181355538088	That makes no sense to everybody.
0.0	0.195083098148	You've got to keep asking because this is a hugely important issue.
0.0	0.232421966978	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.0807296011953	And you shouldn't have mentioned the polls because I would have been much...
0.0	0.0853637557127	I think that would have been right, as well.
0.0	0.0667011845246	The Democrats' answer to everything is more government control over wages, and more empowering trial lawyers to file lawsuits.
0.0	0.235065063653	I have a bill to fix Medicare.
1.0	0.81623415998	And by the way, when I left, there were over 1 million fewer people on welfare in New York state than when I took office...
0.0	0.238854580311	Because they're recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees.
0.0	0.13890100509	...
0.0	0.185854794955	That tells you right away where he was headed on all of this.
0.0	0.381592144833	You know, you go to the internet, you start reading an article and you go to the comments section -- you cannot go five comments down before people are calling each all manner of names.
0.0	0.129152898997	In fact, we need to -- wait a minute -- we need vigilance.
0.0	0.199666868463	But the key thing that we're seeing now is serious challenges to this country that must change, the direction of this nation must change.
0.0	0.0717115055911	Yes, I might feel more comfortable.
0.0	0.258471947599	So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States.

0.0	0.427021416059	That's not true.
1.0	0.982804962633	I think under President Obama we have seen a lot of advances, the Affordable Care Act has helped more African Americans than any other group to get insurance, to be taken care of, but we also know a lot more than we did.

0.0	0.0173206054328	They are more likely to know what's happening in their families and their communities, and they need to feel not just invited, but welcomed within the American society.
0.0	0.748564760606	In fact, I was all for you until you started doing that, because that's a misrepresentation, number one.
0.0	0.190930772963	I may not be your dream candidate just yet, but I can assure you I am Hillary Clinton's worst nightmare.
0.0	0.251858106789	Well, let us level with the American people.
0.0	0.203457655394	America was worth the wait.
0.0	0.356801315303	And in that meeting, I suggested we had a problem with technology, and that I wanted to take people from Silicon Valley into the Pentagon to solve our most significant problems.
0.0	0.286670175336	I came as a reformer.
0.0	0.13492244504	But in the interim, in the absence of that, what's happening is some of these tech companies are taking those -- those centers (ph) to Canada because they can get people to go over there instead of here.

0.0	0.263299078199	Maria, let me clear something up here.
0.0	0.368773877931	Well, I was a conservative governor of Virginia, I governed that way, and that's my track record.
0.0	0.267861181428	We had a decision to make early on, do we do a Super PAC?
0.0	0.527201569172	And I went to one of these Turkish refugee camps right on the border of Syria.
0.0	0.418573529251	Let me say first that it is disturbing that every time one of these home-grown terrorist attacks occurs, and, as your question points out, they are occurring with far too great frequency, it turns out we had warning signals.
0.0	0.536917454454	And for 30 years, the issue of immigration has been about someone who's in this country, maybe they're here illegally, but they're looking for a job.
0.0	0.204784331513	No, not at all, absolutely not.
0.0	0.251147973581	This is the fantasy...
0.0	0.202380671077	So many companies are going to leave our country.
0.0	0.430475409049	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.406544247091	You get the Congress, you get the Senate, you get together, you do legislation.
0.0	0.164985784324	So -- you know, you shouldn't misrepresent how well you're doing with the polls.
0.0	0.36192463254	It's time for real substance and real experience.
0.0	0.533585147782	They're absolutely false.

0.0	0.0812038264307	You can have him.

0.0	0.116738197186	This is extraordinary.
0.0	0.560766753393	I find it very, very hard to forgive people that deceived me.
0.0	0.477047472198	Nobody wants to watch three and a half, or three hours.
0.0	0.198686319183	I'm going to get a response to that, Neil.
0.0	0.451553521858	And what a sad sight that was: Men, women, children forced out of their homes.
0.0	0.278274486423	You know why three?
0.0	0.445779235042	Doesn't hurt rich people if their bar of soap goes up ten cents, but it hurts the poor and the middle class.
0.0	0.0835405286811	No, I think the idea was that president -- then-Senator Obama was wrong for suggesting that it is a good idea to talk to your opponents.
0.0	0.387157202008	Because, I've got to tell you the truth, even in New Jersey what you're doing is called rude.
0.0	0.0542303038269	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.24555168823	They can solve the problem of North Korea if they wanted to but they taunt us.
0.0	0.918326727821	Three million women have fallen into poverty under this administration.
1.0	0.812153924495	The blurb said that the next president of the United States has got to be aggressive in bringing people into the political process.
0.0	0.700531919243	So when they -- be found against that country that's selling products in here lower than the cost of what it takes to produce them, then what do we tell the worker?
0.0	0.0560260383878	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.0763422482021	But I'm not worried about my finances, I'm worried about the finances of everyday Americans who today are struggling in an economy that is not producing good paying jobs while everything else costs more.
0.0	0.284119918772	I saw them come down.
0.0	0.408476863401	We've already got a great talker in the White House.
0.0	0.416642846977	It's tax-free -- a huge advantage for our farmers and ranchers and manufacturers -- and every import pays the 16 percent business flat tax.
0.0	0.309448035779	You know, they feel like if they don't have a lobbyist, if they're not wealthy, that somehow they don't get to play.
0.0	0.314468252906	And yes, it was a very difficult time.
0.0	0.110602021286	That's right.
0.0	0.304764417743	You know, before it was called Obamacare, it was called Hillarycare.
0.0	0.171593601001	I've tried to be as specific to answer questions so that my proposals can be vetted, because I feel like we have to level with people for the very reason, Gwen, that you are mentioning.
0.0	0.568050708289	I voted yes to suspend that.
0.0	0.34814709415	And as Reagan demonstrated, if we cut taxes, we can bring back growth.
0.0	0.216500192091	And if we want to try to rebuild the coalition, as Governor Kasich was saying before, then what we better do is to get to the Arab countries that believe that ISIS is a threat, not only to them, but to us and to world peace, and bring them together.
0.0	0.220966118187	We cannot elect somebody that doesn't know how to do the job.
0.0	0.643355364183	You've seen middle-class wages go backwards $3,700 during the Obama administration.
0.0	0.567912876834	I believe this is still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.102105182948	Can we stop?
0.0	0.315621724752	We lose on trade.
0.0	0.202095248707	But it is a general economic issue.
0.0	0.447314391862	And we just got to make sure that every American has the tools, in K-through-12 and in vocational education, in higher education.
0.0	0.107702539768	They are the ones who should respond to any questions.
0.0	0.292828962336	We should be relying upon the leadership of the Congress to pass the laws.
0.0	0.348496428274	But we allowed people to keep health care.
0.0	0.0911638578591	And here's why.
0.0	0.233193200976	And believe me, Assad is not worth it.
0.0	0.508658558431	It was a company that had grown into a bloated, inept bureaucracy that cost too much and delivered too little to customers and shareholders.
0.0	0.0783095380667	Why should we let their people be sitting there smoking their cigars, sitting in their comfortable chairs in Raqqa?
0.0	0.114934937255	So I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.216500434798	Let's quit making it a problem for them.
0.0	0.34406825754	There is a radical jihadist group that is manipulating our immigration system.
0.0	0.234524147309	I was down there, and I've never seen anything like it.
0.0	0.295206234411	Our rights come from God.
0.0	0.0826757834169	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.172613064976	How are we going to do this?
0.0	0.406554206534	I'll tell them that we're going to grow the economy so that we can give people better opportunities so they don't have to rely exclusively on benefit types of programs.
0.0	0.0372070829123	That's absurd, and I think people who don't want to fix it, really, or unwilling to take the chance to say, "something has to change," are missing the boat here.
0.0	0.0530168678851	...No, sir...
0.0	0.320622611541	So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.244976928962	The time to act is now.
0.0	0.0687856770389	If we do not know who you are, and we do not know why you are coming when I am president, you are not getting into the United States of America.
0.0	0.335576675835	If you're not willing to do that, nobody wants to do it, but if you're not willing to gradually raise the age, you're not serious about fixing either one of them.
0.0	0.541927782498	So it's not just the government -- the private sector companies, it's also our own government that needs to raise the level of our game.
0.0	0.305217925723	I'll suggest a part of that was his celebrity.
0.0	0.660198225609	No, it's your record.
0.0	0.182253835454	And the people who are getting hammered are small businesses, it's single moms, it's Hispanics.
0.0	0.263229005407	We need to have some coalitions in that part of the world to go after ISIS, but we also need to send a clear message.
0.0	0.607479966386	The B-52 is still operational as the long range bomber; it was inaugurated in the age of Harry Truman.
0.0	0.169251192411	But everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro- gay-marriage, focus around money and the media.
0.0	0.895545037355	I have a concrete plan to do just that, which allows people to keep HSAs to encourage savings, it allows for people that are retiring with Social Security to be able to get a minimum of 125 percent of the poverty level so that there is a baseline that in this generous country of ours no one goes below.
0.0	0.390906467398	I think it's a wonderful that that businesses start a 401(k).
0.0	0.338090675001	I went out and said, it's ridiculous.
0.0	0.194343834983	If I am president of the United States, we're going to send soldiers back to Iraq, back to Syria, to keep us from being attacked here and keep soldiers in Afghanistan because we must.
0.0	0.338820932717	If we're willing to do what it takes now, the 21st century is going to be the new American century, greater than any other era we've had in the history of this great nation.
0.0	0.485156109871	Well, that just wasn't -- that just wasn't the fact, Senator.
0.0	0.101405316181	And it's especially significant that they are working with both Turkey and Greece in order to do this.
0.0	0.128867298584	I was on morning Joe at a town hall and a young student stood up and said, "Can I still be idealistic?"
0.0	0.22190345003	... you're not going to have peace in Syria with Assad in charge.
0.0	0.344286776719	Companies should, if they want to attract the best workers, provide a good set of benefits.
0.0	0.0467331569073	Thank you.
0.0	0.0900411824263	That's not right.
0.0	0.157210391744	We need to rebuild our military, and this president has let it diminish to a point where tinpot dictators like the mullahs in Iran are taking our Navy ships.
1.0	0.831002812868	Well, Marco has been floating this attack for a few weeks now, but the problem is, the business flat tax in my proposal is not a vat.
0.0	0.342189853305	This is about more than replacing a D with an R. We need a leader who will help us take our government back.
0.0	0.168532731874	And I would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country.
0.0	0.128258338108	They're off to China.
0.0	0.143764884008	So we have work to do.
0.0	0.49028588266	We need to begin by undoing -- I would begin by undoing a whole set of things that President Obama has done, whether it's illegal amnesty or this latest round of EPA regulations.
0.0	0.0648698971903	But I know who the pessimist is.
1.0	0.999989492117	You used to support a 500 percent increase in the number of guest workers, now you say that you're against it.
0.0	0.486149584531	Last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee.
0.0	0.576485813844	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the free enterprise system.
0.0	0.437656703766	This president allows lawlessness throughout this country.
0.0	0.333658945174	What are the rules on who gets to follow up.
0.0	0.212422235586	Here is the one thing I'm not going to do.
0.0	0.736629005496	This is a group of people that enslaves women and sells them, sells them as brides.
0.0	0.24223066762	...in the world for people...
0.0	0.838255783071	There have been more than 4,000 changes to the tax plan since 2001 alone.
0.0	0.0997325843685	But...
0.0	0.0951014710108	You also have to get rid of all the deductions and all the loopholes.
0.0	0.208768421962	If you make your president, I'm going to put the country ahead of the party.
0.0	0.214915853238	It could be people that are going to do great, great destruction.
0.0	0.736651400961	And it costs, with dynamic scoring, less than a trillion dollars.
1.0	0.422824555601	He has called him a disappointment.
0.0	0.0308731229045	Why aren't we talking about -- instead of cutting benefits for old people, cutting benefits for sick people -- why don't we say, "let's cure the four big cost-driving diseases...
0.0	0.167156375447	A person who, in fact, has a long experience in foreign-policy issues, which is different from many of the other governors and prospective governors who are running.
0.0	0.76320250882	It increases the per child tax credit, because I didn't read about this in a book.
0.0	0.119226408664	You see, because if you really want to get to a balanced budget, you need to reduce your expenses and you need to grow your economy.
0.0	0.0648431140677	And that's why I've offered a specific program to the people of America tonight to address the fundamental problem of getting our country growing again, getting our economy growing, wages up, opportunities for people.
0.0	0.0593108791922	If you want someone who's not going to divide Washington, but gets things done, then you should make me your president.
0.0	0.382974757289	We would still have sexism preventing women from getting equal pay.
0.0	0.123616249415	That's a dictatorship.
0.0	0.158809467131	And recognizing that it's so important, this election, because we're talking about America for the people versus America for the government.
0.0	0.12913350471	While there are lots of good ideas for reform, we have never tackled the basics.
0.0	0.708080398547	I have been a strong ally with him on virtually every issue.
0.0	0.225759118896	No.
0.0	0.543930067233	Everybody on this stage is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.399450541283	Watching this broadcast tonight are millions of people that are living paycheck to paycheck.
0.0	0.196971544729	... no, you already had your chance, Marco, and you blew it.
0.0	0.0780512232245	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.975654016734	When you have three out of the four largest financial institutions in this country bigger today than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have six financial institutions having assets equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of America, while issuing two-thirds of the credit cards and a third of the mortgages, look, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, that great trust-buster would have said break them up.
0.0	0.0838333439576	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.5	Every penny we needed from -- every penny we got from Social Security, because my sister was a minor, we needed.
0.0	0.725915506829	The rate -- the rate -- the rate is gonna be much closer to 15 percent.
0.0	0.10160690056	We need to stop that.
0.0	0.182546071702	I think the American people are look for real leadership.
0.0	0.381136161256	I know every one.
0.0	0.192561907596	They're devaluing their currency and they're killing our companies.
0.0	0.803383303359	As a result, eight credit upgrades; as a result, a top ten state for private sector job creation.

0.0	0.191476374034	And what I have said is I will not throw us further into debt.
0.0	0.268342571225	So yeah, someone who makes more money...
0.0	0.824721597335	I've said I'm looking at a couple of different ways, one which you mentioned, Senator, but also trying to expand the existing tax to passive income that wealthy people have so that we do get more revenue into the Social Security Trust Fund.
0.0	0.621186266456	The deployments are too high for the military personnel.
0.0	0.462853855205	And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, because I've been a leader on these issues.
0.0	0.092075076704	But you know what?
0.0	0.253123707294	So I have voiced criticisms.
0.0	0.137529912479	And that's what I intend to do.
0.0	0.547597733823	Today, I'm 60, I'm not married, I don't have any kids.
0.0	0.398828661579	We have to shut down their internet capability.
0.0	0.307020397334	Government trying to level the playing field between Internet and brick-and-mortar creates a problem.
1.0	0.981471630938	I have long supported the proposition that we should lift the cap on taxable income coming into the Social Security Trust Fund, starting at $250,000.
1.0	0.882343076843	But more importantly, in terms of this Libya resolution that you have noted before, this was a virtually unanimous consent.
0.0	0.408647996699	We need to be on the side that keeps Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.0974518090536	We're not -- the American people -- forget about anything else, they've already been lied to and stolen from.
0.0	0.604974413641	Because criminals don't buy their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.149634327683	ON the other side, you have so many Republicans, and what do they care about?
0.0	0.139887361702	We need to be focusing on what fixes this country.
0.0	0.251139736896	Over the last few weeks, I've listened to Jeb as he walked around the country and said that you're modeling your campaign after John McCain, that you're going to launch a furious comeback the way he did, by fighting hard in New Hampshire and places like that, carrying your own bag at the airport.
0.0	0.113419534895	That is why there is massive despair all over this country.
0.0	0.151825579842	And we will be strong again.
0.0	0.146933006273	And right now, I will be putting up a tremendous -- so far, I've put up less than anybody and I have the best results.
0.0	0.0732761512662	So you know what needs to happen, it's a very simple equation, and it's going to happen when I'm president.
0.0	0.571813517445	I can tell you, after spending seven years as a former federal prosecutor, right after 9/11, dealing with this issue.
0.0	0.482491521224	But, here is a pledge I've made throughout this campaign, and it's really not a very radical pledge.
0.0	0.597185084177	I do believe that in the year 2016 we have to look in terms of public education as colleges as part of public education making public colleges and universities tuition free.
0.0	0.133507541581	Take it from your professors...
0.0	0.0724252955224	But she did say there was anger.
0.0	0.333055564855	I've got five grandkids.
0.0	0.19235422185	And second, the international crisis we are facing is most dreadful and most dangerous.
0.0	0.124296391663	For once, let's do that, and stop trying to give them some kind of fantasy that's never going to come true.
0.0	0.527256296561	And, if this government doesn't pay it, than tell me what's different between the government and Bernie Madolf, who sits in prison today for doing less than what the government has done to the people on social security and Medicare in this country.
0.0	0.306352343589	We're going to make a really dynamic economy from what we have right now, which is not at all dynamic.
0.0	0.19776443663	Maria, Neil, thank you for a great debate tonight.
0.0	0.146875687907	And it's important that people really look hard at what the threats and dangers we face are, and who is best prepared for dealing with them.
0.0	0.145674151786	And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.
0.0	0.0689201731579	And -- and -- and the last piece of this, Maria, is this.
0.0	0.18486136509	That we do all that we can to create a world of peace and prosperity.
0.0	0.305193209818	Since he brought me up, do I not get to respond?
0.0	0.130108192822	And then the Government steps in to try and solve the problem and we get a little further down to that progressive vision that Hillary Clinton is talking about.
0.0	0.300746804365	We have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9/11, and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks, yet we see the terrible attack in San Bernardino and know that we haven't done enough.
0.0	0.319324547657	You know, I think most people know exactly what New York values are.
0.0	0.297991953815	At the end of the day, the legal issue is quite straightforward, but I would note that the birther theories that Donald has been relying on -- some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on U.S. soil, but have two parents born on U.S. soil.
0.0	0.410440701996	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.125831920178	And the way we've done it properly through regulatory action, not buy signing unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.382583374291	When you're a governor, you're held accountable for everything you do.
0.0	0.351841894845	Guaranteeing that women's work finally gets the pay, the equal pay that we deserve.
0.0	0.434421553181	You have to deal with entitlements, you have to be in a position to control discretionary spending.
0.0	0.117878214557	But if we elect the right person -- if you elect me -- we will turn this country around, we will reclaim the American dream and this nation will be stronger and greater than it has ever been.
0.0	0.114858045227	You know, I see a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist.
0.0	0.108998554156	And that's just not acceptable.
0.0	0.687204648821	A flat tax for everybody -- no exemptions, no deductions, no shelters, because some people have a better capability of taking advantage of those than others.
0.0	0.342299106304	And that's what you'll hear from Hillary Clinton -- and I've already heard from her -- is that, send more money in Social Security, send more money in Medicare taxes, send more money for Medicaid, and that's gonna solve the problem.
0.0	0.0851001720928	And clearly, what we need to do is get a group of experts together, including people from other countries, some of our friends from Israel, who have had experience screening these people and come up with new guidelines for immigration, and for visas, for people who are coming into this country.
0.0	0.112046231327	I get to respond, right?
0.0	0.202889913327	Thank you all very much.
0.0	0.154613828607	That will never happen when I am president of the United States.
0.0	0.0675844859805	I think that's a mistake.
0.0	0.328104052127	It took -- it took an arm and a leg to be able to set up a 401(k).
0.0	0.331751100109	And by those standards, we're not doing particularly well.
0.0	0.279829526925	I think to be commander in chief in the 21st century requires someone who understands how the economy works, someone who understands how the world works and who's in it; I know more world leaders on the stage today than anyone running, with the possible exception of Hillary Clinton; understands bureaucracies, how to cut them down to size and hold them accountable; and understands technology, which is a tool, but it's also a weapon that's being used against us.
0.0	0.894415651644	You're looking at the -- at the man who introduced and fought on the floor as a freshman senator and passed the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 over two President Clinton vetoes.
0.0	0.0684158524946	Do we have answer for that?
0.0	0.0553434296677	OK?
0.0	0.381025966642	They don't provide any abortions in Louisiana.
0.0	0.14755154655	I'm going to do it for America.
0.0	0.249259379535	We need to make sure that we keep the country safe.
0.0	0.0820873848047	And that is wrong.
0.0	0.263646475748	And this deal is giving him a pathway to a bomb, a missile to deliver it, and money to pay for it all.
0.0	0.407216553225	Well, if that's the case, we're going to win every state, if Bernie Sanders is the nominee.
0.0	0.216884056589	That's was hard work.
0.0	0.114933860091	How can we beat an enemy if our commander-in-chief doesn't have the moral honesty and clarity to say that Islam has a problem, and that problem is radical Islam, to say they've got to condemn not generic acts of violence, but the individual murderers who are committing these acts of violence.
0.0	0.309098249111	For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses closing than starting.
0.0	0.0809955076816	And I will go back to Washington with my plan.
0.0	0.173329138306	I don't think you expand entitlements when so many people are dependent on government and when the money the federal government is offering is going to be taken away from you after just a couple of years.
0.0	0.0605807688106	When you head back to airport tonight, go check and see what the...
0.0	0.612551124787	On day one in the Oval Office, I would make two phone calls.
0.0	0.188712610232	Too often, they give up, they negotiate with themselves.
0.0	0.406858628765	Probably in terms of the applying for the job of president, a weakness would be not really seeing myself in that position until hundreds of thousands of people began to tell me that I needed to do it.
0.0	0.31907313038	I said, absolutely, you can still change the world.
0.0	0.294338325222	This country is changing.
0.0	0.44779208766	We put in place child care support.
0.0	0.285101698898	I think America is just a few good decisions and a leadership change at the top away from the best years we've ever had.
0.0	0.282887561344	It was the AFL-CIO.
0.0	0.192180540023	We could overthrow Assad tomorrow if we wanted to.
1.0	0.5	It allows President Obama to borrow unlimited amounts of money.
0.0	0.0913426137552	I think he is right.
0.0	0.114622643526	We need a unifier, not a cynical divider in chief, and that's exactly what I will do.
1.0	0.854988609287	He wrote a forward for a book that basically argued voters should have buyers' remorse when it comes to President Obama's leadership and legacy.
0.0	0.476406227796	I would take the fight to these guys, whatever it took, as long as it took.
0.0	0.139924126247	The American people are never going to trust Washington, D.C., and for good reason.
0.0	0.316099327339	Today a male African-American baby born today stands a one-in-four chance of ending up in jail.
1.0	0.876244371621	In the past he has called him weak.
0.0	0.343727232124	You know, I have two sons.
0.0	0.591152611894	Well, first off, let's face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
0.0	0.123493282576	... his answer -- you name it.
0.0	0.00847090294399	... the fact is, Neil, let's think about -- let's think about -- and I want to maybe -- I hope the president is watching tonight, because here's what I'd like to tell him.
0.0	0.0835272762099	But I want to go further.
0.0	0.297463930447	Let me, you know, again, respectfully disagree with Secretary Clinton here.
0.0	0.249004544659	I've had my issues with Donald Trump.
0.0	0.176381440899	We can do a wall.
0.0	0.489546025891	And they don't buy their guns from a gun store.
0.0	0.240440932203	And if you really want to believe that you can get your voice back, I will tell you, as I have all my career, I will continue to fight for you, because you're the ones that built this country, and will carry it into the future.
0.0	0.0804891574151	But bottom line is: The president is right.
0.0	0.354174613163	I believe in government, but I believe in efficient government, not wasteful government.
0.0	0.195137593648	Well, let me tell you this.
0.0	0.127287882185	But to destroy ISIS, it is necessary.
0.0	0.147474222559	They haven't done that.
0.0	0.916405710353	So the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced: a simple flat tax, 10 percent for individuals, and a 16 percent business flat tax, you abolish the IRS...
0.0	0.0891859585021	... and as president, I'm going to fight for the working men and women.
0.0	0.267323940171	This is not some small scale group.
0.0	0.291145427493	And now they see Hillary Clinton proposing a third term of economic policy for our country.
0.0	0.351580594862	If you do that, you don't just change the economy, you transform the lives of millions of hurting Americans.
0.0	0.395223729887	Here is where we are with public education.
0.0	0.243302730891	Well, I'm just not sure I agree completely with that assessment.
0.0	0.436076320061	I was a person who has dealt extensively with these homeland security issues.
0.0	0.697266011267	Businesses will now have to pay 16 percent on the money they make.
0.0	0.414960533671	You know, I completely agree with Senator Sanders.
0.0	0.450229232978	So what we do, though, is, if there is somebody who is price- gouging, we have laws for prosecutors to take that on.
0.0	0.675072258188	And she is just one or two more poll drops down from even moving further left than she's moved already to get to the left of Bernie on this.
0.0	0.227999190437	But you know what, you can make a middle class wage, you have decent health care, decent benefits.
0.0	0.359254070344	And, yes, people we may disagree with on a number of things may have some insight, may have some relationships that are important for the president to understand in order to best protect the United States.
0.0	0.365873368047	Well, there's no question that ISIS is a very serious problem, and I don't believe that this administration recognizes how serious it is.
0.0	0.571653035473	Any connection to the fact that not one Republican candidate for president thinks and agrees with the scientific community that climate change is real and that we have got to transform our energy system?
0.0	0.272599814753	We just, earlier this week, kicked them out of Medicaid in Louisiana as well, canceled their provider contract.
0.0	0.44642914015	I have the opportunity not just to run, but to win in the deep blue state of New York three times.
0.0	0.480782104281	The issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24 months ago.
0.0	0.732535069018	Unfortunately, Governor Christie has endorsed many of the ideas that Barack Obama supports, whether it is Common Core or gun control or the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor or the donation he made to Planned Parenthood.
1.0	0.836586521054	And the reason I said that is because the FBI director told the American people, told Congress, that he could not guarantee he could vet them and it would be safe.
0.0	0.207304156026	Can I just add one very quick thing?
0.0	0.875787322165	... of $50 billion...
0.0	0.0503515513135	We should be deporting criminals, not hardworking immigrant families who do the very best they can and often are keeping economies going in many places in our country.
0.0	0.0946592603228	The president doesn't understand -- and by the way, neither does Secretary Clinton -- and here's my warning to everybody out in the audience tonight.
0.0	0.0911216899173	Right.
0.0	0.190432342006	What we need to do is destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.422907245963	There's no way he launches 11 attack --
0.0	0.225759118896	No.
0.0	0.420049023152	So that is not by any stretch a pie in the sky.
0.0	0.352978683264	Senator Cruz is precisely right.
0.0	0.0668361877587	But I think they will see a very good option here.
0.0	0.295017442117	One thing I want to be clear about tonight.
0.0	0.103998375506	Well, a couple of things.
0.0	0.36326924788	Almost every hotel in Atlantic City has either been in bankruptcy or will be in bankruptcy -- the biggest.
0.0	0.418258358837	The fact of the matter is he doesn't realize that we now live in the 21st century, and that war is very different than it used to be before.
0.0	0.175022709562	Secretary Clinton has been going around the country saying Bernie Sanders wants to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, people are going to lose their MedicAid, they're going to lose their CHIP program.
0.0	0.156034627156	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.240624616874	That's not why I ran for office.
0.0	0.0292989199331	And what is that proposal?
0.0	0.0832345908945	You know, you look at what's going on, you see all the divisiveness and the hatred that goes on in our society.
0.0	0.155032840787	Well, first of all, let's understand why we are even having this debate and why Donald tapped in to some of that anger that's out there about this whole issue.
0.0	0.455586389487	Let me concur with the secretary, no question women's rights are under fierce attack all over this country.
0.0	0.392129530783	If I have a weakness, it's that I try to live by the rules.
0.0	0.133823287219	And I'm glad that I have a chance to answer this question.
0.0	0.164062333944	It's good to be with you.
0.0	0.58592491708	If I'm the nominee, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.424054616706	All over this country we have Republican candidates for president saying we hate the government.
0.0	0.123564470631	He's wrong.
0.0	0.521223162173	In all due respect, Secretary Clinton, a lot of the progressive groups, the online groups have really asked you a simple question.
0.0	0.353266880968	What we are talking about in reality is a corrupt campaign finance system, that's what we're talking about.
0.0	0.235201737544	It never happens.
0.0	0.0671226230897	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.577216750559	Fred Thompson was the other one, a man who had spent a lot of time on that screen.
0.0	0.289551716381	They're sick of politics as usual.
0.0	0.223907566741	He just writes out an order, executive order.
0.0	0.24576804943	I think it's a good product.
0.0	0.114562476068	And, let me now on Social Security because we were getting into a good substantive exchange, and I want to say I think both Chris, and Mike are right.
0.0	0.225122442699	It was a hard choice.
0.0	0.169485595026	Say again?
0.0	0.711097089905	Today, we have a legal immigration system for permanent residency that is largely based on whether or not you have a relative living here.
0.0	0.320750086244	I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would.
0.0	0.11119694515	The fact is, the reason why...
0.0	0.206126211836	That's what I'm working towards.
0.0	0.249003052465	And women have been disadvantaged ever since.
0.0	0.209800276067	Our wages are growing faster than the national average, and I've cut taxes more than any sitting governor in this state -- $5 billion, including no taxes on small business and killing the death tax.
0.0	0.298848486082	If we don't stop them over there, they are coming here just as sure as I stand here in front of you.
0.0	0.509713280201	I've learned from him that what we need to achieve is peace through strength, which means we need to rebuild the military.
0.0	0.422664090614	This election has to be about reversing all of that damage.
0.0	0.208669695245	So, also, we can stimulate the economy.
0.0	0.25756404773	In my family, my dad fled oppression in Cuba to come to America.
0.0	0.8123305137	We have a budget closer to $3.5 trillion.
0.0	0.64605580302	I also believe that marriage is between one man and one woman.
0.0	0.931554363295	Back in 2004, one of my predecessors to the Senate by the name of Bob Graham, a Democrat, ran for president missing over 30 percent of his votes.
0.0	0.128237087835	We need to be very well aware of the fact that China and Russia are using technology to attack us, just as ISIS is using technology to recruit those who would murder American citizens.
0.0	0.180841173425	And I say that to Nikki.
0.0	0.149162411407	These...
0.0	0.285634534522	And we need to do that throughout the country.
0.0	0.157583266063	And he was a managing general partner.
0.0	0.336248437137	Now that he is, he's changed his tune.
0.0	0.159460694559	I would begin by saying that I'm not sure it's a weakness, but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for America's future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people.
0.0	0.835081100647	So when you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration -- which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother -- clearly, we are looking at institutional racism.
0.0	0.302347567606	I ask for your support to build, together, a safer and stronger America.
0.0	0.275648036149	So I'm going to come up with the best way forward.
0.0	0.00381721520538	... an agreement with the...
0.0	0.387860455467	If you take donations from Wall Street, you can't be independent.
0.0	0.228985854628	That is the appropriate approach in order to get the results that you are seeking.
0.0	0.115030706916	Big and powerful use big and powerful government to their advantage.
0.0	0.492158637269	I'm a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.809586827108	One of them is a statewide use of deadly force.
0.0	0.369998579311	What I believe is the United States, in fact, should join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee healthcare to all people.
0.0	0.196428133411	And that's why Ronald Reagan said that it was a blindfold.
0.0	0.578444319436	We have talked about tax reform in every single election for decades.
0.0	0.0617461069755	It's like them getting mugged, and then us saying, well, we're going to mug you some more.
0.0	0.201675885718	And you combine that with reforms of our welfare system.
0.0	0.1052606646	See, in Ohio, we've had some controversial decisions.
0.0	0.268158978509	I'm going to prioritize those recipients who need the most help first.
0.0	0.416433243073	We can reform those entitlements, we can change that corporate tax code and lower it.
0.0	0.091163082012	We bailed them out.
0.0	0.431818056527	2016 is going to be a fight between conservatism, and a Democrat party that is undermining the very character of this nation.
0.0	0.435829070265	I think they made the Second Amendment the second amendment because they thought it was just that important.
0.0	0.217203239111	That's why I've been leading the fight to stop it.
0.0	0.702830814708	The the truth of the matter is, big government benefits the wealthy, it benefits the lobbyists, it benefits the giant corporations.
0.0	0.143016716615	He's penalized -- and doesn't understand.
0.0	0.261898484681	They're a scam.
0.0	0.18923007089	They understand that there's a national security risk.
0.0	0.179236412299	We don't need Hillary Clinton's price controls for -- again, does anybody out there think that giving Washington, D.C., the opportunity to run the pharmaceutical industry is a good idea, given how well they have done running the government?
0.0	0.406289696162	And it is a -- the kind of criticism that we've heard from Senator Sanders about our president I expect from Republicans.
0.0	0.059781744317	But I would add this.
0.0	0.243342680797	Because the damage he has done to America is extraordinary.
0.0	0.237675795981	You have to lead.
0.0	0.562176804066	CLINTON: Judy, I think that the best analysis that I've seen based on Senator Sanders plans is that it would probably increase the size of the federal government by about 40%, but what is most concerning to me is that in looking at the plans -- let's take healthcare for example.
0.0	0.136923892555	The fact is that there was a great effort made by the Obama administration and others to really send a clear message, because we knew that so many of these children were being abused, being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border.
0.0	0.0481242591595	We are all frustrated with what China is doing.
0.0	0.493650852044	Marco leaves the IRS code in with all of the complexity.
0.0	0.0502971844891	I will do that in Washington.
0.0	0.221760006421	And in your heart of hearts, you cannot wait to see a debate between Hillary Clinton and Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.196814719352	I know some people like to say, "well, this is free money."
0.0	0.121625080184	Edward Snowden is a traitor.
0.0	0.343586186691	And God only knows Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator.
0.0	0.141603849046	We don't need that.
0.0	0.25850728918	He is the party's frontrunner right now, and good for him.
0.0	0.448675800054	You'll see me on the floor of the Senate tomorrow filibustering this and saying enough is enough, no more debt.
0.0	0.294018496296	You know, I have said -- I have said many times, you know, I'm not asking people to support me because I'm a woman.
0.0	0.698024623595	And one more point, one more point.
0.0	0.316738971638	Thirdly, we need to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to send a serious signal that we're back in the game with Israel --
0.0	0.0793272580097	I can.
0.0	0.689323563566	We're borrowing a million dollars a minute.
0.0	0.518370977486	The truth is I had to make some tough calls in some tough times.
0.0	0.241952762745	We know (ph) to go ahead and shut off the supply routes, and send in our special ops at 2:00 a.m. and attack them everywhere they go.
0.0	0.186735994559	I have seen him appoint people to our courts not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.0823436201031	So, let's stop fooling around about this, let's tell people the truth.
0.0	0.0582586565356	... and I'll tell you why.
0.0	0.248972719696	I would choose Nelson Mandela for his generosity of heart, his understanding of the need for reconciliation.
0.0	0.920898664181	My 750,000 donors have contributed more than a million and a half donations.
0.0	0.187445286801	I'm worried about bankrupting the American people.
0.0	0.406391653028	That could be the great Trojan Horse.
0.0	0.0972325272669	China and Russia have never been on our side of the table.
0.0	0.367118017927	You know, you had Herbert Hoover before that saying, no, we got to only worry about the deficit.
0.0	0.0505812293862	But a great nation like ours should not be in a position where elderly people are cutting their pills in half, where they don't have decent nutrition, where they can't heat their homes in the wintertime.
0.0	0.114808256898	And I believe people need a leader who is prepared to make tough calls in tough times and stand up...
0.0	0.411148753622	Here's my promise, at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country.
0.0	0.415006055557	Let me tell you what I would do immediately, day two in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.173947202748	And if you can't use the term, you're never going to solve the problem.
0.0	0.129121284628	In my administration, we will help to make sure we bring people together in the Middle East, and we will fight ISIS and defeat them.
0.0	0.143724608057	But also, I can't fake anger.
0.0	0.221656169573	OK, just so you understand -- I know so much about trading about with China.
0.0	0.226625271928	It's not fair trade.
0.0	0.0959569579951	According to the FBI and the director of national intelligence, Syria's becoming a perfect platform to strike our nation.
0.0	0.342640937756	We both have a lot of small donors.
0.0	0.0997325843685	And...
0.0	0.341452402625	My mom who's here today, was a single mom when my father left us when I was 3 years old.
0.0	0.490265438998	He's a major Hillary Clinton supporter.
0.0	0.10387212306	We have to stand with them.
0.0	0.104160151775	CRUZL But I will say --
0.0	0.196582608442	Because we work with the private sector to make solar energy affordable and available to businesses and individuals in our state.
0.0	0.400450665933	I've spent a lifetime in politics fighting the Clinton machine.
0.0	0.164896947972	And they will work with me to get comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.0716237335214	I understand.
0.0	0.125157336352	And there's a reason why Hillary's supporters are echoing Donald's attacks on me, because Hillary...
0.0	0.210731595791	I far prefer that and the chances we have to be successful there than trying to start all over again, gridlocking our system, and trying to get from zero to 100 percent.
0.0	0.230588919379	You do.
0.0	0.1250315391	And what I think all of us are saying is, our monetary policy, our tax policy, regulatory policy needs to be radically changed so we can create high sustained growth for income to rise.
0.0	0.186614226596	You're right.
0.0	0.221357364503	They are -- they're in a position where they're smothering people.
0.0	0.3186685791	Last week, Secretary Carter announced that the Navy's going to be cut again.
0.0	0.207809443663	Obamacare, we're going to repeal it and replace it.
0.0	0.09617716449	You looking at me?
0.0	0.201412233746	Never been done before, never been done since.
1.0	0.987125106507	And what that's led to over $2 trillion of American companies' monies that are being kept offshore, because they don't want to pay the second tax.
0.0	0.0761092221861	And I'm not blaming these folks -- well, I guess I could.
0.0	0.128208860316	The way to take that away from them is to talk to our military officials and ask them, "what do you need in order to accomplish this goal?"
0.0	0.0306461733425	I was the architect.
0.0	0.225278255246	Yes.
0.0	0.344398934146	Are you serious about this election?
0.0	0.396120966719	We need to have stronger families.
0.0	0.215594987262	And if you become the nominee, who the hell knows if you can even serve in office?
0.0	0.124382155591	We have to shut down, whether or not they're in prisons preaching or on -- in mosques preaching.
0.0	0.342602621633	In fact, it's the chief argument by democrats against many of the different flat tax proposals.
0.0	0.22599257901	Young people for whom getting involved in politics is as, you know, it's like going to the moon.
0.0	0.390516206592	In all due respect...
0.0	0.147836500757	Credibility counts.
0.0	0.679563401873	He used chemical weapons, he's killed, now, over a quarter of a million of his own people, and this president has done nothing.
0.0	0.223104200694	Let me (inaudible).
0.0	0.0913957826211	But what happens if, God forbid, the next Barack Obama takes over, and the next Nancy Pelosi, and the next Harry Reid...
0.0	0.0809374578133	You know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money.
0.0	0.45839128019	Somebody who, yes, votes right, but much more than that, leads the efforts to protect the hard-fought gains that women have made, that, make no mistake about it, are under tremendous attack, not just by the Republican presidential candidates but by a whole national effort to try to set back women's rights.
0.0	0.571572660107	The Republican Party is blessed to have 11 good candidates, (inaudible) 10 good candidates.
0.0	0.25657836394	That was before he was running against me.
0.0	0.187242951927	I win.
0.0	0.41213725338	The government has tried it their way.
0.0	0.160229540986	That will change everything.
0.0	0.254995988936	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.26357110773	We need sound money.
0.0	0.313510916768	Of course you are right.
0.0	0.312496912424	Well, when you look at the celebrity of Donald Trump, then I think that says a lot about it.
0.0	0.246159468243	I ran for office to make the generational changes in Louisiana.
0.0	0.464515885405	This president has gone to Congress and said give me a three-year deadline, give me a ban on ground troops.
1.0	0.133162311701	I was not at all critical of him.
0.0	0.0874852548443	I'm the only guy on this stage -- you know, everybody has an "only guy" -- "I'm the only guy this; I'm the only guy that."
0.0	0.210283751853	And the reason is simple: because in 2008, we elected as president someone who wasn't interested in fixing America.
0.0	0.39214624762	But if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in Flint.
0.0	0.219798215457	I strongly support the president's executive actions.
0.0	0.188092568864	If she gets elected, her first 100 days, instead of setting an agenda, she might be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse.
0.0	0.0998619265131	But the greatest gains, percentage-wise, for people, are gonna be at the lower end of our plan, and here's why: because in addition to a general personal exemption, we are increasing the per-child tax credit for working families.
0.0	0.180364517488	John, I'll tell you something.
0.0	0.228339887269	But that's not an accurate description of the plan.
0.0	0.251526761699	In my view, it doesn't go anywhere near far enough.
0.0	0.222425579912	So I know Secretary Kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease-fire up as quickly as possible.
0.0	0.261530958096	The planes are older than the pilots.
0.0	0.249866560135	This president has failed, and when I'm in the Oval Office, police officers will know that they will have the support of the president of the Untied States.
1.0	0.945469389643	As I understand it, the African-American community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse.
0.0	0.290266822019	Today, many of us picked up our newspapers, and we were horrified to see the sight of 10 American sailors on their knees, with their hands on their heads.
0.0	0.594987991729	And by the way, it's not just on immigration, you used to support TPA, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.673067244822	...The other thing I'd like to make about our plan, one more point, it is the most pro growth tax plan that I can imagine because it doesn't tax investments at all.
0.0	0.130812346235	You know that.
0.0	0.378336213015	It's the only way you fix Medicare, the only way you fix Social Security.
0.0	0.226190207642	Neil, Neil -- can I say one thing about this.
0.0	0.162551220749	I'm ready.
0.0	0.237620095136	So the answer is no and what Jeb said is absolutely correct.
0.0	0.20633835228	It is a unique nation in all of human history and on the face of the planet, because here, our founders believed that everyone has a right to fulfill their potential and that that right --they called it life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness -- comes from God and cannot be taken away by government.
0.0	0.1601318691	You've got to keep asking.
0.0	0.224778427618	The other Arab countries have a role to play in this.
0.0	0.176476627579	And then in addition to that, the American people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.565781766685	Now in terms of their really stunning hit piece, what they mentioned is when I was running for senate -- unlike Hillary Clinton, I don't have masses of money in the bank, hundreds of millions of dollars.
0.0	0.127995021402	Because now he's going a little bit better.
0.0	0.246343663221	Before this, I was a very successful person as a developer and as a businessman.
0.0	0.0381136098637	You find me...
0.0	0.186423894389	Actually, I'd love to get you to build a wall.
0.0	0.440727111929	She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video.
0.0	0.0595886229348	It needs to be repealed and replaced.
0.0	0.570763562052	I lead the opposition against it.
0.0	0.108432045744	You can't do nothing.
0.0	0.721506913422	It's a private-sector solution that believes in freedom, not Obamacare that believes in government control.
0.0	0.249887712513	Well, first off, what we don't do is do what Hillary Clinton and John Kerry and Barack Obama want us to do, which is their solution for everything, put more taxes on it, give more money to Washington, D.C., and then they will fix it.
0.0	0.122613756705	And that's an economy where ordinary Americans are working longer hours for low wagers.
0.0	0.291868760965	That's wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country.
0.0	0.281574003005	You have to ban radical Islamic jihadists.
0.0	0.466800567902	I promise.
0.0	0.097851482387	That expertise needs to spread all across the government and there needs to be much more cooperation with our private sector.
0.0	0.0667704923554	We're not going to solve this problem with traditional politics.
0.0	0.339369824855	Not just the hacking of OPM, but that is -- that is just shameful.
0.0	0.188511041261	That's not the way the game is supposed to be played.
0.0	0.451479303426	No, the Federal Government should not play a larger role.
1.0	0.861559565024	Six million more people living in poverty than the day that Barack Obama got elected president, and the left just wants more of the same.
0.0	0.176898718583	I'm deadly serious about doing this job the right way.
0.0	0.328724914226	But we can give people better health care.
0.0	0.18605169896	But for that Texas police officer, we could have had a mass murder.
0.0	0.617096874307	And by the way, the police are the most mistreated people in this country.
0.0	0.0494223373038	And God bless America.
0.0	0.602052230252	I have Ryan Tannehill, Marco, as my quarterback, he was 18 for 19 last week.
0.0	0.136051895332	But on this point, if I may add something on this point.
0.0	0.10382624628	And our economy was growing like crazy.
0.0	0.0754687506835	I can do that.
0.0	0.225950543745	Absolutely, they should fight to fund -- defund Planned Parenthood, and I don't think the president should shut down the government simply to send our taxpayer dollars to this group.
0.0	0.30997441164	...This is a matter not of math, this is a matter of morality.
0.0	0.331317970473	If I become President because we'll have a Constitutional Amendment to require a federally balanced budget so they will do their job.
0.0	0.111529901426	Just want to get that out there, just saying.
0.0	0.123254161001	This is a humanitarian catastrophe.
0.0	0.306482175069	And yet the man who led my firing, Tom Perkins, an icon of Silicon Valley, has come out publicly and said, "you know what?
0.0	0.60984319535	And I can do it regardless of what the makeup of Congress is because I did it in New York state.
0.0	0.470425269746	Well, that has not been a part of most of the proposals that I've seen.
0.0	0.233498141909	... so you don't actually want to hear the answer, John?
0.0	0.670806054666	So we have no disagreement about the need to buttress Social Security, get more revenue into the program.
0.0	0.485799575039	And you put me on that stage against her next September, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.0637305030517	And together, we can solve these problems that hurt us and heal America.
0.0	0.532212211545	Iran sanctions -- the Iran sanctions that brought them to the table, those are sanctions that we put in place when I was in the United States Senate, and a whole host of other things that put me in a position of saying, I not only have a great vision, but I can govern effectively in Washington.
0.0	0.190365408839	I am not a single- issue candidate, and I do not believe we live in a single-issue country.
0.0	0.600249324849	Madam Secretary, that is a low blow.
0.0	0.172788185867	And let's not let the secular progressives drive that out of us.
0.0	0.233864950279	They don't want them made here.
0.0	0.0999990762753	I can tell you, there wouldn't have been much damage.
0.0	0.212222046374	... on the issue -- on the issue of citizenship, Donald...
0.0	0.225759118896	No.
0.0	0.559382093756	It always seems to be the private marketplace does a better job.
0.0	0.24677484336	If you'll answer the (inaudible) core question.
0.0	0.25791369697	Why don't we just give a chicken in every pot, while we're, you know, coming up -- coming up with these fantasy tax schemes.
0.0	0.697937680373	You know, when you go into the store and buy a box of laundry detergent, and the price has up -- you know, 50 cents because of regulations, a poor person notices that.
0.0	0.0450783395255	Caesar's -- excuse me -- Caesar's, the Rolls-Royce, as you know, is in bankruptcy.
0.0	0.205176899281	I was invoked in that question, so let me just say -- in that answer -- let me say, the real question here, I hate to interrupt this episode of Court TV.
0.0	0.0618944815888	I'll talk to them.
0.0	0.148128976132	That makes the world less peaceful, less safe.
0.0	0.271952157745	And I would note the other individuals on this stage were nowhere to be found in that fight.
0.0	0.508709937618	Which is what we're gonna get if we elect a big government liberal like Hillary Clinton to the White House.
1.0	0.707849212461	Our military is a disaster.
0.0	0.608489384264	She voted for it.
0.0	0.148987100262	I want to go back to what we were talking about earlier, this budget deal in Washington.
0.0	0.251753001939	There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government to be setting minimum wages...
0.0	0.150003137342	Freedom is personal for me, and I will always keep my word and fight for freedom.
0.0	0.256161590286	How about Obamacare, a certified job killer?
0.0	0.15942776503	And just thirdly, he was so nice.
0.0	0.171487662423	This is about people's lives, and we should level with the American people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare.
0.0	0.147213128661	What we know is we're living longer.
0.0	0.096705043945	Or would you rather take less later on?
0.0	0.199289961386	But, by the way, when it comes to a woman having to make a very personal choice, ah, in that case, my Republican colleagues love the government and want the government to make that choice for every woman in America.
0.0	0.097704471216	You know why?
0.0	0.286166598577	The question always is, what works better, the private marketplace or government?
0.0	0.797092350107	Well, they're the ones not listening to the scientists today, because doctors say that at 20 weeks that is a viable life inside the womb.
0.0	0.58072801765	And I'll tell you what Hillary Clinton has said: Hillary Clinton says she agrees with the dissenters -- the Supreme Court dissenters in the Heller case.
0.0	0.386774727221	That is the way to deal with China at the end of the day.
0.0	0.954552691489	One of the great challenges that we have, $150 billion is fixing to go to a country that killed our Marines in Lebanon, that used their weapons to kill our young men in Iran.
0.0	0.128096503237	So, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities.
0.0	0.424026370099	We now have some good models about how better to provide employment, housing and education.
0.0	0.134685981928	But you know, here's the real issue, is this America anymore?
0.0	0.0707952032732	They should be running all the time, then they won't have time to plan attacks against us.
0.0	0.392806740387	That's how you make peace in the world.
0.0	0.22968321958	He was overthrown by British and American interests because he threatened oil interests of the British.
0.0	0.25026311693	We elected someone as president who wants to change America, who wants to make it more like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.235091377589	So what I will tell you about our incentives -- our incentives are tight, and at the end of the day we make sure that we gain more from the creation of jobs than what we lose.
0.0	0.0750871501568	I do, however, believe in Reagan's 11th commandment, and will not be engaging in awful things about my compatriots here.
0.0	0.408061221442	You see, you have one side, the Democrats, and with immigration, all they care about is votes.
0.0	0.148719655219	And I mean, are you kidding me?
0.0	0.375448516509	We don't have a health care crisis in America, we have a health crisis.
0.0	0.126788258192	And in fact I would go further.
0.0	0.144542217502	And at that point, it's a life that we have the right to protect, and I think we should protect.
0.0	0.377460336898	Look, it takes three things basically to grow jobs.
0.0	0.203787211655	And that doesn't have to be true.
0.0	0.560219540151	And I used it to pay off my loans.
0.0	0.203752961758	They believe some are smarter than others, some are better than others, so some are going to need to take care of others.
1.0	0.932736100172	Someone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander in chief and someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi can never be president of the United States.
0.0	0.0110017423939	SuperPacs are a disaster.
0.0	0.0948201822027	I think there is constitutional and legal authority for the president to have done what he did.
0.0	0.53292662245	Mine actually cuts the payroll tax, and I think it would spread the tax cut across all socioeconomic levels, and would allow then it to be something that would be broadly supported by the public in an election.
0.0	0.0467331569073	Thank you.
0.0	0.268940200906	Well, it's not a matter of what the first executive order would be, Bill.
0.0	0.261144576588	It's the people that pull the trigger and we have to find out what is going on.
0.0	0.0819071089823	So we need to get on a different mindset.
0.0	0.317166486657	Let me translate that for you.
0.0	0.450718559528	It was a terrible sight.
0.0	0.179056370403	As we speak, there are new problems on the horizon.
0.0	0.247125933406	I was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came.
0.0	0.142389925618	And we should back up the recent donors conference to make sure we have made our contribution to try to deal with the enormous cost that these refugees are posing to Turkey and to members of the E.U.
0.0	0.429247651266	Now, you can support one now that's very low.
0.0	0.0336900940873	That is not what America should be about.
0.0	0.21472376516	It is time to believe in America again.
0.0	0.245774580669	America is back in the leadership business.
0.0	0.285172887039	The business flat tax, they already impose their taxes on us, so there's no reciprocal...
0.0	0.162420746635	They didn't do that either.
0.0	0.480096577232	And with respect to the 2007 bill, this was Ted Kennedy's bill.
1.0	0.9930688862	You used to support legalizing people that were here illegally, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.458193876943	About every two weeks, he holds a press conference talking about how he can't wait to restrict people's access to guns.
0.0	0.159349552386	Gosh, I'd love for us to talk about something like that.
0.0	0.347688771815	But I will tell you this, Atlantic City, you're using that, hundreds of companies that I have opened have thrived.
0.0	0.317506202592	Do I take the product?
0.0	0.191171037894	Imagine a country where the middle class can get rising income again.
0.0	0.238442777694	But I think it is really unfair to suggest that I have not been supportive of the president.
0.0	0.262387707171	It's you see the health insurance companies getting together.
0.0	0.085124067761	Let's listen to them and let's not listen to our politicians.
0.0	0.188445625497	We have a tremendous problem.
0.0	0.207849657315	I think that's a major accomplishment.
0.0	0.36001908183	We honest to god are here to get this country back on track.
0.0	0.536237444436	You find a Democrat that's for cutting taxes -- cutting spending ten dollars, I'll give them a warm kiss.
0.0	0.307995226585	Well, I don't know if it's a blind trust if Ivanka, Don and Eric run it.
0.0	0.992673747763	Now, Secretary Clinton's Super PAC, as I understand it, received $25 million dollars last reporting period, $15 million dollars from Wall Street.
0.0	0.41027395227	It's Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.179644745103	Finally, we'll take off the political handcuffs.
0.0	0.0886023187816	I think I'm going to win fair and square (inaudible) to win this way.
0.0	0.0597126407147	I think he would have been right.
0.0	0.0838333439576	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.120223304881	But I guess I'm supposed to come out great.
0.0	0.296717779252	I will change the culture in Washington, just as I changed the culture in Tallahassee.
0.0	0.160206389444	And that's why we must make sure we continue to frack.
1.0	0.508107848143	Becky, it is the height of hypocrisy for Mrs. Clinton to talk about being the first woman President, when every single policy she espouses, and every single policy of President Obama has been demonstrably bad for women.
0.0	0.09137155177	And as president, I will rebuild the military and keep this country safe.
0.0	0.188609197029	We're going to be tough at the border, we're going to be tough on all of the illegal immigrants that everybody else in this field -- we're going to be different.
0.0	0.202308933715	The more the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected are advantaged.
0.0	0.130477963978	I'll check for you.
0.0	0.252296005698	Well, first of all, if a company gets caught doing that, they should never be able to use the program again.
0.0	0.253543231996	We didn't spend any.
0.0	0.266467464236	You know, I know to a lot of people in the media, this is just a great big game, and we're the players.
0.0	0.119125190847	Secondly, a policy on recruiting and hiring, and then more resources for -- for training.
0.0	0.148685041064	But if you want someone to drive you home, I will get the job done and I will get you home.
0.0	0.239659332615	If you elect me president of the United States, I will secure that southern border.
0.0	0.831661115699	Well, first of all, we're running a $2 billion dollar surplus, we're not having a revenue problem right now.
0.0	0.0341691668789	And I think the focus ought to be on making sure that we leave this nomination process, as wild and woolly as it's going to be -- this is not being bad.
0.0	0.1563925455	But I'm going to tell you the truth.
0.0	0.146812368214	Here is the case, they both agree, they can't make a deal.
0.0	0.628341737513	At the core of that resolution is an agreement I negotiated in June of 2012 in Geneva, which set forth a cease-fire and moving toward a political resolution, trying to bring the parties at stake in Syria together.
0.0	0.227521133655	The other issue is mental health.
0.0	0.257634679846	It's kind of basic.
0.0	0.143643670899	I think we should be for free trade but I think fair trade.
0.0	0.190074652616	Neil, my name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.188922701334	Absolutely.
0.0	0.484428673876	So, I'm proud of Senator Sanders, and his supporters.
0.0	0.208292015325	And remember this -- I'm credible on this for this reason: Americans for Tax Reform says that I've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history.
0.0	0.160309587762	That sounds like people are afraid the president's going to take their guns away.
0.0	0.281675011388	On welfare.
0.0	0.00573492597669	But let's be clear: Russia's aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO -- correctly, I believe -- are saying, you know what, we're going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action.
1.0	0.947516600568	Well, the average small manufacturer, whatever they're manufacturing, drugs or anything, if they have less than 50 employees, the average cost in terms of regulations is $34,000 per employee.
0.0	0.319269974696	That is the way we deal with global warming, climate change, or any of those problems, not through government intervention, not through government taxes, and for God's sake, don't send Washington another dime until they stop wasting the money they're already sending there.
0.0	0.243307754658	But the facts and the law here are really quite clear.
0.0	0.127943402223	And there's a bunch of things my tax plan does to help them.
0.0	0.355215962708	And so much of what we did -- to force competition, to use technology, to stand down the special interest groups -- can you imagine taking Medicaid from 10 to 2.5 percent?
0.0	0.30440076991	But in 2008, we elected a president that didn't want to fix America.
0.0	0.27005542442	It's extraordinarily wrong.
0.0	0.168791987203	You want to talk about what we're going to be up against next year?
0.0	0.178821041777	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
0.0	0.119419851655	So look, corporations ought to exercise some responsibility.
0.0	0.0490882265736	When -- when we put all the facts down, you'll be able to see that it's not true, it works out very well.
0.0	0.258385934241	We have Dodd-Frank.
0.0	0.0274749600073	That's how you solve the problem.
0.0	0.26323989697	I want to take care of women.
0.0	0.693998050107	Number one, you have people in this country that...
0.0	0.252409786705	We need to make sure that people understand, as Jeb said before, that if you've done extraordinarily well in this country, do you want them to take more out of your taxes now and think they're gonna give it back to you later?
0.0	0.109377502164	I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.225073253558	Let's let a Justice Department -- and I will make an attorney general who will enforce the law and make justice more than just a word.
0.0	0.0942708638936	There's something going on and it's bad.
0.0	0.101501961924	-- the issue is who is going to get it done.
0.0	0.215207279945	I think he would have said bring back a 21st-century Glass-Steagall legislation.
0.0	0.0253296932602	So I'm going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of Americans fulfilling their potential, because I don't think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single American to live up to theirs.
0.0	0.225880236292	I had to work my way through school.
0.0	0.300227757736	And we have to take on ISIS online.
0.0	0.114293726935	And listen, there is a real difference between Marco's tax plan and mine.
0.0	0.380809325659	... they don't like the Wall Street Journal.
0.0	0.212846423587	Well, let's go with three.
0.0	0.16103073966	We sent our Texas ranger recon teams.
0.0	0.464859344418	I've got the backbone, I've got the band width, I've got the experience to get us through this.
0.0	0.00902119090003	And -- you know, all of this too big to fail stuff and picking and choosing winners and losers -- this is a bunch of crap, and it is really causing a great deal of -- great deal of problems for our society right now.
0.0	0.353073950913	Eleven points, to be exact.
0.0	0.904160524138	If it's Medicare for all, then you no longer have the Affordable Care Act, because the Affordable Care Act, as you know very well, is based on the insurance system, based on exchanges, based on a subsidy system.
0.0	0.125502662502	But, I would also add this.
0.0	0.313002457346	And I would not support those.
0.0	0.139644928987	Here's the truth.
0.0	0.178821041777	She sees her cost of electricity going up.
1.0	0.256363040795	The government stole it, and spent it a long time ago...
0.0	0.408887331655	Yesterday, the president stunningly admitted this.
0.0	0.734807536241	Every single time that there has been a Defense bill in the Senate, three people team up to vote against it.
0.0	0.139865967559	We're going to let people in, but they're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.280050750034	We need fundamental police reform, clearly, clearly, when we talk about a criminal justice system.
0.0	0.277947577703	And make sure you enhance savings in the private market.
0.0	0.640958706857	Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.
0.0	0.0902582662218	And, you look at the questions -- "Donald Trump, are you a comic-book villain?"
0.0	0.347024304739	Yes, our allies are not perfect.
0.0	0.0809380510112	...Or, even some famous Colorado brownies.
0.0	0.839985729455	I started the Gang of Seven, and it led to the overtaking of the 40-year Democratic rule of Congress, because I didn't -- I stood up to the old-boy network in Washington, D.C. because I believed that Washington was not the solution, that Washington was the problem, just like Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.0473873276069	So, we're going to enforce the law, we're going to change policing practices, we're going to change incarceration practices, but we're also going to emphasize education, jobs, and housing.
0.0	0.111185331573	But I was born here.
0.0	0.12929598456	It is a constitutional right of every American to be able to protect themselves and their families.
0.0	0.225842384494	You know, I find it really quite fascinating some of the president's proclamations.
0.0	0.448323583161	So, we're talking about -- we're talking about reform for people like me and people like Senator Cruz, as he talked about earlier, who are years away from retirement that have a way to plan for these changes, and way that's very reasonable.
0.0	0.247919584877	You cannot make rash statements and expect the rest of the world to respond as though, well, it's just politics.
0.0	0.15328913609	We had Iran putting operatives in South America and Central America.
0.0	0.366634102803	If they don't treat us fairly, hey, their whole trade is tariffed.
0.0	0.620261006248	But Jeb is also right that, if we just impose a tariff, they'll put reciprocal tariffs, which will hurt Iowa farmers and South Carolina producers and 20 percent of the American jobs that depend on exports.
0.0	0.528441771595	They attacked us in San Bernardino two weeks ago.
0.0	0.494851136397	Number two, this isn't me saying it.
0.0	0.311235846381	Gronkowski is still going strong.
0.0	0.46331782051	When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York.
0.0	0.169142208702	In this particular moment of serious crises, saying to the American people don't give up on the political process.
0.0	0.137360005037	I think if it doesn't...
0.0	0.309953811433	I deployed the National Guard after I stood on the ramp in Dallas, Texas and looked the president of the United States in the eye and said, "Mr. President, if you won't secure the border, Texas will," and that's exactly what we did.
0.0	0.291147848407	I've got a proven record fighting to defend the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.465788361225	So the indignation that you carry on, some of the stuff, you have to also own then.
0.0	0.0826757834169	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.319257898347	Yes, they've got to get out of Syria.
0.0	0.123355326752	And there is no reason that you can't be perfectly fair to the gay community.
0.0	0.341131636534	Well, I was pleased that NATO announced just this week that they're going to start doing patrols in the Mediterranean, in the Aegean, to try to interdict the smugglers, to try to prevent the kind of tragedies that we have seen all too often, also to try to prevent more refugees from coming to the European Union.
0.0	0.291359577369	And that's why 2016 is a turning point in our history.
0.0	0.80303358276	Well, to put that in a context, Judy, I think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top one-tenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled.
0.0	0.511987833629	It's actually evidence of the bias that exists in the American media today.
0.0	0.18859202828	The worker's out of a job.
0.0	0.736510636447	I know that we are at greater risk today than at any time since then of another attack.
0.0	0.0985147334148	We are mixing apples and oranges.
0.0	0.139484199725	The Europeans have moved on.
0.0	0.0728573644983	But we need to understand that American Muslims are on the front line of our defense.
0.0	0.131325154893	We need security.
0.0	0.847943225396	And by the way, the attack he keeps throwing out on the military budget, Marco knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion.
0.0	0.241643461292	Well, you just -- you just listed a litany of discredited attacks from Democrats and my political opponents, and I'm not gonna waste 60 seconds detailing them all.
0.0	0.400277014956	OK. You know, you judge a nation not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how you treat, we treat, the most vulnerable and fragile people in our nation.
0.0	0.564472784444	We're talking about a state that moved graduation rates forward from 27th in the nation to second-highest.
0.0	0.683294469824	Number one, we have to create better paying jobs.
0.0	0.206392806418	And I recognize -- I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa.
0.0	0.198591635344	I understand both of these issues, how to build the economy and doing that as a governor who'd built jobs, had cut taxes and also a governor who understands foreign-policy, and that's why I entered this race.
0.0	0.0705454671946	Get it done, because our -- our children and grandchildren are counting on us to get it done.
0.0	0.0210706443164	And, I also just want to thank the audience for being attentive, and noticing the questions, and the noticing the answers.
0.0	0.097076987164	I'd sign that executive order.
0.0	0.398420209832	I have gone time and time again to take on the vested interests who would keep women's health care decisions the province of the government instead of women ourselves.
0.0	0.538200756277	That cost gets passed on to the people.
0.0	0.700381922188	And Senator Sanders's plan really rests on making sure that governors like Scott Walker contribute $23 billion on the first day to make college free.
0.0	0.140595390305	With respect to the United States, I think our role in NATO, our support for the E.U., as well as our willingness to take refugees so long as they are thoroughly vetted and that we have confidence from intelligence and other sources that they can come to our country, we should be doing our part.
0.0	0.815439122521	Republican leadership joined with every single Democrat, add $80 trillion to our debt to do nothing to fix the problems.
0.0	0.967536919239	I started as a secretary and became ultimately the chief executive of the largest technology company in the world, almost $90 billion in over 150 countries.
0.0	0.330633105865	I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators -- back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.
0.0	0.472090574793	I never said that.
0.0	0.680746876056	Health savings accounts are something that we introduced.
0.0	0.062284198284	And we will join the rest of the other -- the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families.
0.0	0.281830294273	They recognize that people's actions don't always match their words.
0.0	0.12995974812	Why weren't they vigilant?
0.0	0.292785010946	But I think to suggest that I have voiced criticism, this blurb that you talk about, you know what the blurb said?
0.0	0.429985521875	He appointed Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, someone who has been a radical against the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.
0.0	0.282245366406	It isn't "I put money in, I'm getting it back."
0.0	0.26736796659	The entire system of legal immigration must now be reexamined for security first and foremost, with an eye on ISIS.
0.0	0.587737605854	Washington gets bigger, taxes get higher, and the American people feel more distance from our government.
0.0	0.296654884528	There's a reason the NRA gave me their Carter Knight Freedom Fund award...
0.0	0.149615560996	Well, the deal was done.
0.0	0.226035467493	For the people who say we can't do it, I say hell no, we can do it together.
0.0	0.664125321753	He pushed through, and he passed the Dodd-Frank regulation, the toughest regulations since the 1930's.
0.0	0.0553434296677	OK?
0.0	0.284001087305	They know that this country is not respected around the world anymore.
0.0	0.461295656065	And that's why they have it in Europe, because it is a way to blindfolded the people, that's what Ronald Reagan said.
0.0	0.269741209361	Because what she will do is come in and she will raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.550476521659	I'm against the kind of inhumane treatment that is now being visited upon families, waking them up in the middle of the night, rounding them up.
0.0	0.08847916971	I think you're --
0.0	0.601082546747	The simple fact is one of the ways, Maria, to solve the problem you described is narrow the number of people coming by family petitioning to what every other country has so that we have the best and the brightest that come to our country.
0.0	0.0652423884009	There'll be people here that will talk about what they're going to do.
0.0	0.143625466286	And if we capture any of them alive, they are getting a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know.
0.0	0.708498748272	Two of them were among the most highly decorated -- they weren't allowed on a military base to have guns.
0.0	0.349496949429	There is a great deal of skepticism about the federal government.
0.0	0.237418732058	His family certainly believes that.
0.0	0.0771349786967	It ain't going to happen.
0.0	0.274811598516	And Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will say it's those evil rich people.
0.0	0.340793278325	This is the same old stuff since I left.
0.0	0.0423445516473	Think about it.
0.0	0.514955364118	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.0292363245771	We need to solve problems, we need to rebuild our military so we can stand up to radical Islam, we need to get our economy growing much faster by throwing out the corrupt tax code and lowering the rates.
0.0	0.257753417095	And, we have a government and leaders in government that are completely out of touch, and that's why I'm running for president.
0.0	0.615817287035	Where I see the weakness is in those three people that are left on the Democratic stage.
0.0	0.426505655909	And if I misrepresented those results or those projections in any way, I was held criminally liable.
0.0	0.5	I stood on the stage and watched Marco in rather indignantly, look at Governor Bush and say, someone told you that because we're running for the same office, that criticizing me will get you to that office.
0.0	0.748634541342	We warned about the 9/11 attack before the 9/11 attack occurred.
0.0	0.279327900331	So we do as the United States have to support our friends, our allies in Europe.
0.0	0.378743264248	Let's allow companies to immediately expense.
0.0	0.730803977739	I put together the coalition that imposed the sanctions on Iran that got us to the negotiating table to put a lid on their nuclear weapons program.
0.0	0.0726463193901	But here's the best solution of all.
0.0	0.268760908178	It will end on January 2017.
0.0	0.0601942626862	But my wife is down here in the front, and I'm sure, if you'd like to talk to her later, she can give you more than you'll ever be able to take care of.
0.0	0.790703652961	Truth is that far more blacks get stopped for traffic violations.
1.0	0.9999928301	We do what the American people want, to expand Social Security by $1,300 a year for people under $16,000, and we extend the life of Social Security for 58 years.
0.0	0.453846819146	Because I think we have to get to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.43181188641	Well, Maria, I'm glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what's going on in the world.
0.0	0.314398154059	You know, back in September, my friend Donald said that he had had his lawyers look at this from every which way, and there was no issue there.
0.0	0.153993343262	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.447981670831	What kind of signal does that send to the rest of the world that the United States is a serious player in creating peace and security?
0.0	0.701199786879	Roads, bridges, water systems, wastewater plants, who denies that?
0.0	0.0753586006335	And we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid.
0.0	0.477686072059	What he said, and he said it in the last debate, it's simply not true.
0.0	0.0467331569073	Thank you.
0.0	0.171072997729	And until we deal with the health of Americans and do what we did with polio -- when I was a little kid, we eradicated it.
0.0	0.249315653614	That is the fight we have to have, and we have to undo a whole set of things that President Obama has done that get at the heart of his disrespect and disregard for too many Americans.
0.0	0.529809771319	You know, I won two record elections.
0.0	0.26215661848	But let me say one more thing.
0.0	0.575894414862	What we have to do right now is bring our people together and understand that we must provide a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people.
0.0	0.230928533009	The agreement on a cease-fire, though, is something that has to be implemented more quickly than the schedule that the Russians agreed to.
0.0	0.113223585546	Republicans and Democrats alike believe this.
0.0	0.092075076704	And you know what?
0.0	0.26357110773	We need sound money.
0.0	0.124595271883	They know.
0.0	0.0812731736685	And people said "you can't win, you can't change the culture."
0.0	0.309219015124	So if you're having Medicare for all, single-payer, you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing.
0.0	0.315928110946	I like Chris Christie, but we can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports Common Core.
0.0	0.235699308486	I would give up some Social Security to save a system that Americans are going to depend on now and in the future.
0.0	0.0944824334154	I'll tell you how optimistic I am about America.
0.0	0.269082995898	That's why George Romney, Mitt's dad, was eligible to run for president, even though he was born in Mexico.
0.0	0.491197097261	They see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on Wall Street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all.
0.0	0.220290551527	In other words, the very rich are getting richer, almost everybody is going -- getting poorer.
0.0	0.230965719468	It'll be a pretty busy day, but that Iran negotiation is going to be torn up on day one.
0.0	0.230474008354	Well, you know what?
0.0	0.167673332865	Are you fed up with how Washington wastes your money?
0.0	0.222292903118	I am against the raids.
0.0	0.200361322486	And you're not serious about destroying ISIL.
0.0	0.348190896545	... on the issue of citizenship, Donald, I'm not going to use your mother's birth against you.
0.0	0.0206736082275	But I look at this country today, and I look at how divided we are, I look at how politicians are always posturing and issuing sound bites but never solving problems.
0.0	0.328103663716	I just want to remind you, people paid their money.
0.0	0.0772909831793	And listen, there are many, many wonderful, wonderful working men and women in the state of New York.
0.0	0.0824712748253	It's not constitutional.
0.0	0.285087134701	Of course, they would.
0.0	0.39334846616	What have you got now?
0.0	0.546653210191	We're on the verge of being the first generation of Americans that leave our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.843882526366	It's a 20 percent flat rate tax, it'll take a blowtorch to the -- to the IRS.
0.0	0.153794123062	It's why you see the pharmaceuticals getting together.
0.0	0.559725375978	Since I was attacked too.
0.0	0.169441516966	We have to be prepared to defend the American people, prepare them for a long war, stand up for the defense of this country, and stand up for the values of this country...
0.0	0.21869690247	If elected president, I will do everything I can to expand Social Security benefits, not just for seniors, but for disabled veterans, as well.
0.0	0.205064512925	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.377775792144	You just see the recent deal announced today or yesterday, more spending, more tax increasing, more regulation.
0.0	0.196934795764	I want to find out -- many people saw pipe bombs and all sorts of things all over their apartment.
0.0	0.320716738254	But those kinds of personal assessments and charges are ones that I find particularly troubling.
0.0	0.577607889152	I think it's great that Senator Sanders, President Obama and I have more donors than any three people who have every run, certainly on the Democratic side.
0.0	0.0404677209948	That's a blessing.
0.0	0.179223271786	But -- if for some reason, Neil, he beats the rest of the field, I already know the Democrats are going to be bringing a suit.
0.0	0.317931744895	This stuff is fantasy.
0.0	0.225759118896	No.
0.0	0.330665621548	And multiple reputable journals, including The Wall Street Journal, said ours is the best.
0.0	0.143092531264	Their family is waiting for them.
0.0	0.0706494043521	Good luck making something out of this mess."
