0.0	0.0553502706597	You know, you look at what's going on, you see all the divisiveness and the hatred that goes on in our society.
0.0	0.062525192234	... the fact is, Neil, let's think about -- let's think about -- and I want to maybe -- I hope the president is watching tonight, because here's what I'd like to tell him.
0.0	0.0639646536782	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.0656185393917	And guess what?
0.0	0.0676882369051	We need to know who our neighbors are.
0.0	0.067740882399	See when you're a senator, what you get to do is just talk and talk and talk.
0.0	0.0744679395869	And when you do that, you will be amazed at how much progress you can make, and how much healing we can have.
0.0	0.0801117697677	Caesar's -- excuse me -- Caesar's, the Rolls-Royce, as you know, is in bankruptcy.
0.0	0.081115831568	Good luck making something out of this mess."
0.0	0.0817393173676	It feels different.
0.0	0.0841193437517	I agree with them.
0.0	0.0873107271577	And who can blame them?
0.0	0.0905099532304	And I say, look, it's not Republicans' fault, it's not Democrats' fault, it's your grandparents' fault for having too many damn kids.
0.0	0.0921353912229	We need a unifier, not a cynical divider in chief, and that's exactly what I will do.
0.0	0.096758753684	I will continue to have tremendous admiration and respect for Governor Bush.
0.0	0.097613838375	...No, sir...
0.0	0.100746282551	So, we have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.103157591529	I think America can only live up to its potential when we make sure that every American has a chance to live up to his or her potential.
0.0	0.103543763689	And I'm not blaming these folks -- but I guess I could.
0.0	0.103783079069	I will not shock anybody to suggest that in politics there is occasionally a little bit of hypocrisy.
0.0	0.103958277542	And, thank you everybody.
0.0	0.104822160311	Gosh, I'd love for us to talk about something like that.
0.0	0.106342808925	How do we decide on who gets to follow up?
0.0	0.106385643356	I know we have a president who wants to do whatever he wants to do, and take his pen and his phone and just tell everybody what he thinks is best.
0.0	0.106467791001	But furthermore, what we have got to do, I'm sorry, yes, I do believe that we have got to do everything that we can, and it will not happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.106640944723	Not everybody remembers that.
0.0	0.107329309386	Oh yeah, we want to elect a good president, but America is great from the bottom-up, and the bottom-up is us in our families, in our communities, in our neighborhoods.
0.0	0.107643987297	Next, we have to talk to our adversaries, and we have to make sure they understand the limits of our patience.
0.0	0.107846283877	The truth is this, the big problem, we need a leader in Washington who understands how to get something done, not to talk about it, not to propose it, to get it done.
0.0	0.108613795724	He undermines it.
0.0	0.108904264834	And that's why we have to use Carl (ph) and we have to use our great businesspeople and not political hacks to negotiate with these guys.
0.0	0.111209017701	I want to use that same up here, whatever it may be to make America rich again and to make America great again.
0.0	0.112075727641	The Koch Brothers have a very clear political agenda.
0.0	0.112199065313	Now, Bill, he loves to criticize America, apologize for us, criticize medieval Christians.
0.0	0.112298356704	And that's really a theme of a lot of the things that I'm talking about.
0.0	0.113799138159	We need to elect someone who will stand with the American people, who understands its greatness, who understands what an open economy and freedom is all about, but at the same time, has a record of being able to get things done in Washington like we've never seen before.
0.0	0.11438778873	And how do I know it?
0.0	0.114408512169	And that's why I think these ideas up here are great, and that's what we should have is have more discussions like this and less gotcha.
0.0	0.114719015086	Oh, I'll talk about that, too.
0.0	0.115677709578	... stirs up the demagoguery against American Muslims, that hurts us at home.
0.0	0.115915951804	Do you remember that, everybody?
0.0	0.117517752377	... and I'll tell you why.
0.0	0.118412603798	But we need to understand that American Muslims are on the front line of our defense.
0.0	0.118537975009	I frankly don't think there will be much change because I think what's going to happen is you're going to get more of the same.
0.0	0.11900854414	So we've got some real work to do, and let's try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the Russians.
0.0	0.119050760259	Nevertheless, one of the things that I think people don't always understand is how accountable a CEO actually is.
0.0	0.11905899613	So I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.119631993905	That's what I think we need to do.
0.0	0.119840713742	We're going to fight it as hard as we can, and we're going to fight whoever the Republicans nominate who will depend on the Koch Brothers, and others.
0.0	0.119969207577	So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives.
0.0	0.120366359271	And -- and I just want to take this opportunity to say, you know, in the 2012 election, you know, we -- and when I say we, Republicans -- tore themselves apart.
0.0	0.120875863248	And Mexico's going to pay for the wall because Mexico -- I love the Mexican people; I respect the Mexican leaders -- but the leaders are much sharper, smarter and more cunning than our leaders.
0.0	0.121093003323	That's what they do, whether it's the San Bernardino attack or if it's these tragedies that take place, I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is.
0.0	0.123017757151	I'm aware of that.
0.0	0.12334888498	You know, we've got a lot of great talkers running for president.
0.0	0.124136769837	But, let me tell you who not to blame.
0.0	0.125428098596	And I think together we will make progress.
0.0	0.125535380353	I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.125745192977	Such a nasty -- such a nasty question, but thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.126294421682	So I'm going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of Americans fulfilling their potential, because I don't think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single American to live up to theirs.
0.0	0.126842178889	How great is that?
0.0	0.129544331531	I love the Chinese people but they laugh themselves, they can't believe how stupid the American leadership is.
0.0	0.130091960201	And I could say, oh, I'm not angry.
0.0	0.130453441907	But if you want someone to drive you home, I will get the job done and I will get you home.
0.0	0.133612170185	When -- when we put all the facts down, you'll be able to see that it's not true, it works out very well.
0.0	0.133902808454	I understand.
0.0	0.134051624158	America's at a crossroads.
0.0	0.134104693157	And, for those of us who are serious enough to run for president, think long and hard why we're here, and hopefully you'll know we're not here for ourselves.
0.0	0.134663134406	Well, first of all, let's understand why we are even having this debate and why Donald tapped in to some of that anger that's out there about this whole issue.
0.0	0.135731826464	And I'll tell you what a weakness is of this country: there are a lot of people who are sick and tired because Washington does not play by the same rules that the American people have to play by.
0.0	0.136710791689	But she did say there was anger.
0.0	0.136956703643	You know I understand why Donald made the comments he did and I understand why Americans are feeling frustrated and scared and angry when we have a president who refuses to acknowledge the threat we face and even worse, who acts as an apologist for radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.138128867849	But here's the point I want to make tonight.
0.0	0.138511280512	I think that's a mistake.
0.0	0.139030207968	I would like to take a hard look at every part of the federal government and really do the kind of analysis that would rebuild some confidence in people that we're taking a hard look about what we have, you know, and what we don't need anymore.
0.0	0.139035254846	HEMMER: Wow.
0.0	0.139051347558	Get it done, because our -- our children and grandchildren are counting on us to get it done.
0.0	0.140575655626	Let people play, who cares?
0.0	0.140790257742	I'm happy to have him tonight...
0.0	0.140979734916	And if you become the nominee, who the hell knows if you can even serve in office?
0.0	0.141044579089	I'll talk to them.
0.0	0.14206084169	And I will tell you something that really galls me.
0.0	0.142339961929	Larry Kudlow is an example, who I have a lot of respect for, who loves my tax plan.
0.0	0.142492248074	And I'm not blaming these folks -- well, I guess I could.
0.0	0.142531886362	So, yes, we can talk about it as a racial issue.
0.0	0.143357344185	And guess what, in 2011, I got a deal...
0.0	0.143399039402	And just thirdly, he was so nice.
0.0	0.144540784303	In all due respect...
0.0	0.145377173783	We need to come together as a country because we have to realize that America is great, not from the top-down.
0.0	0.145491061853	When I think about the folks who are out there at home tonight watching, and I think about what they had to watch this week -- the spectacle they had to watch on the floor of the House of Representatives, with the president of the United States, who talked a fantasy land about the way they're feeling.
0.0	0.14620062257	We have the Russians and the Iranians working together, not to fight ISIS, but to prop up Assad.
0.0	0.146780112424	I'll tell you, in my family there are a lot of single moms in my family.
0.0	0.147086188728	The contrast with the Democratic debate, where every fawning question from the media was, "Which of you is more handsome and why?"
0.0	0.148234322163	...we need to honor our promises...
0.0	0.148554435635	-- the issue is who is going to get it done.
0.0	0.148585211551	And we do need China -- Donald's right about North Korea.
0.0	0.148863088105	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.14898191364	And they must be part of our coalition to destroy ISIS and I believe we can get that done.
1.0	0.149542178926	I'll tell you what else they're upset about: you're 50 or 51 years old, and some kid walks in and tells you you're out of work, and you don't know where to go and where to turn.
0.0	0.149650718963	And I mean, are you kidding me?
0.0	0.150137307574	I absolutely would call on them to collaborate and cooperate, yes.
0.0	0.150303207206	You know, they feel like if they don't have a lobbyist, if they're not wealthy, that somehow they don't get to play.
0.0	0.151032649794	Yes, I might feel more comfortable.
0.0	0.151571796421	And I want to just suggest to you.
0.0	0.151592585438	And, that will get to the nub of opportunity for our children, and an ability to see wages rise.
0.0	0.151726153987	And we're talking about fantasy football?
0.0	0.152114326851	Divide that out.
0.0	0.152303146804	I want to take off from that point and argue the same thing.
0.0	0.152622675519	How do I know this?
0.0	0.153077674037	We ought to have politicians who not only have government experience but know how the CEOs and the job creators work.
0.0	0.153099529342	I'm tired of the hyphenated Americans and the division.
0.0	0.153323999405	But, by the way, when it comes to a woman having to make a very personal choice, ah, in that case, my Republican colleagues love the government and want the government to make that choice for every woman in America.
0.0	0.153506898881	In fact, we need to -- wait a minute -- we need vigilance.
0.0	0.153517589283	But the issue for us is to have a Congress that stands up and says not only no, but "Hell no" to this money going to a regime that is going to use it for terror, Susan Rice has said that, and we need to stand up and strongly and clearly tell the ayatollah that -- whoever the next president of the United States is going to be, and I'll promise you, if it's me, the first thing that I will do is tear up that agreement with Iran.
0.0	0.153941555727	So I just truly, with all my heart belief, I like everybody on the stage.
0.0	0.154137639496	Everybody knows that.
0.0	0.154153562118	I don't see a lot of weakness on this stage, quite frankly.
0.0	0.154323174889	And just so -- if I could, because he insulted a lot of people.
0.0	0.154852817289	I mean, I ask that with all due respect.
0.0	0.15494668606	And, I also just want to thank the audience for being attentive, and noticing the questions, and the noticing the answers.
0.0	0.155002764476	I think he means somebody who hasn't been a career politician, and who's been out of office for awhile.
0.0	0.155266362042	I think we need to be very careful with tariffs, and here's why.
0.0	0.155716461742	If we do not know who you are, and we do not know why you are coming when I am president, you are not getting into the United States of America.
0.0	0.156154006249	So we need to get on a different mindset.
0.0	0.156488655178	Bencarson.com -- we will heal, inspire and revive America for our children.
0.0	0.156537915585	I think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether it's poison in the water of the children of Flint, or whether it's the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the LGBT community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, that's what I want to take on.
0.0	0.156573894338	I've learned from him that what we need to achieve is peace through strength, which means we need to rebuild the military.
0.0	0.156672932864	But like all of our problems, there isn't a single one that can't be solved with common sense if you remove the ego and the politics.
0.0	0.15779163828	Well, John, I don't really have any weaknesses that I can think of.
0.0	0.157967055163	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you had better get rid of the super PACs, because they're causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that are being made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.158353518658	... the American middle class, and who are being attacked by ideologues, by demagogues.
0.0	0.158947048765	I think you do have a humanitarian tragedy there, as I mentioned a moment ago.
0.0	0.159176647387	We hear actually a lot of good intentions.
0.0	0.159301662086	It has to be based on what skills you have, what you can contribute economically, and most important of all, on whether or not you're coming here to become an American, not just live in America, but be an American.
0.0	0.159515202707	But let's be clear: Russia's aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO -- correctly, I believe -- are saying, you know what, we're going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action.
0.0	0.159676222066	And I won't be angry when we fix it, but until we fix it, I'm very, very angry.
0.0	0.160108514425	How can we beat an enemy if our commander-in-chief doesn't have the moral honesty and clarity to say that Islam has a problem, and that problem is radical Islam, to say they've got to condemn not generic acts of violence, but the individual murderers who are committing these acts of violence.
0.0	0.16030849321	We have no borders.
0.0	0.160352669665	I want to speak to all our fighting men and women.
0.0	0.1604586874	But let's not -- but let's not -- let's not insult -- let's not insult the intelligence of the American people.
0.0	0.160529751508	But -- if for some reason, Neil, he beats the rest of the field, I already know the Democrats are going to be bringing a suit.
0.0	0.160629434886	It's not working.
0.0	0.160787898018	That's what I'm working towards.
0.0	0.160958696267	See?
0.0	0.161097785246	I know a lot of Americans are angry about the economy.
0.0	0.161400903394	But I -- the struggle of single moms is extraordinary.
0.0	0.16201270647	They do whatever what they do, OK.
0.0	0.162234602746	Just know where you want to go, stick to your guts.
0.0	0.162472223135	Appreciate it.
0.0	0.162591407118	We need a doer, not a talker.
0.0	0.162961487777	I'm too agreeable, easy going.
0.0	0.163487626704	You know, frankly, I did it in Washington, in Ohio, and I will do it again in Washington, if I'm president, to get this country moving again.
0.0	0.163572941935	... on Larry Tribe.
0.0	0.163695671401	But they need to see leadership, support and resolve from the United States of America, and we can help them defeat ISIS.
0.0	0.163923820873	I do not think we should promise or even look toward normalizing relations because we have a lot of other business to get done with Iran.
0.0	0.164005568225	I know how to do that.
0.0	0.164581329579	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.164671525201	That is total propaganda, and this is what happens in our society.
0.0	0.164680599865	I think what President Obama did was to exemplify the importance of this issue as our first African American president, and to address it both from the President's office, and through his advocacy, such as working with young men, and Mrs. Obama's work with young women.
0.0	0.164715212338	But you know, we don't want to put everybody in the same category.
0.0	0.164866449711	If you want someone who's not going to divide Washington, but gets things done, then you should make me your president.
0.0	0.165249212924	What we need to do is destroy their ability to attack us here over there, and then get out.
0.0	0.165356917266	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.165826998209	For once, let's do that, and stop trying to give them some kind of fantasy that's never going to come true.
0.0	0.165931714348	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.165931714348	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.166137346143	Look, I think we are readier than we used to be, but it's a constant effort that has to be undertaken to make sure we are as ready as we need to be.
0.0	0.166347461758	Here is the case, they both agree, they can't make a deal.
0.0	0.166398733852	But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work.
0.0	0.166454139398	We have to find out what's going on.
0.0	0.166555770885	And they say down as a group trying to make sure that we can begin to heal some of these problems that we see between community and police.
0.0	0.166989210258	If we're going to have a coalition, we're going to have to have a coalition not just of people in the western part of the world, our European allies, but we need the Saudis, we need the Egyptians, we need the Jordanians, we need the Gulf states.
0.0	0.167037913518	And the problem, Maria, is that the military is not ready, either.
0.0	0.167041161959	I want a government so small that the individual has a chance to thrive and prosper.
0.0	0.167544408018	Yeah.
0.0	0.167544408018	Yeah.
0.0	0.167698828128	Because when government gets big and powerful, the big feel like they need to get even bigger to deal with all that power, and meanwhile, the small and the powerless -- in this case, 1,590 community banks -- go out of business.
0.0	0.167885376621	Hey look, he never had a chance.
0.0	0.168122365905	Actually, I'd love to get you to build a wall.
0.0	0.168131543304	And we are not England.
0.0	0.168156078126	I want to be in -- I want America to be the best...
0.0	0.168783048963	We need to tell folks who want to come here, they need to come here legally.
0.0	0.168825829907	But here's the best way that we're going to make America much more exceptional: it is to make sure we put someone on that stage in September who will fight Hillary Clinton and make sure she never, ever gets in the White House again.
0.0	0.169212850346	See, here's the thing.
0.0	0.169323102164	And I have many great Muslim friends.
0.0	0.169695822454	Because now he's going a little bit better.
0.0	0.170071580713	And, folks, we will.
0.0	0.170294421199	I've lived my whole life fighting -- fighting for things that I believe in, fighting for justice and to protect people from crime and terrorism, fighting to stand up for folks who have not had enough and need an opportunity to get more, and to stand up and fight against the special interests.
0.0	0.170320874645	But the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, it's to understand what happens the day after.
0.0	0.170568369025	So there's a lot of balanced interests.
0.0	0.170905174095	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.170981041903	They need to learn English, adopt our values, roll up their sleeves and get to work.
0.0	0.171495504818	See, they don't like that.
0.0	0.171614506506	John, do you want me to answer or do you want to answer?
0.0	0.171704619546	And that's what this economy needs to -- that's what this debate needs to be about.
0.0	0.171955999867	...Thank you.
0.0	0.172773682565	And that's why, as president, I will look at communities that need special help and try to deliver that.
0.0	0.173183775393	Everybody is really doing some bad fact...
0.0	0.173217651909	By the way, unlike our country where we're totally predictable and the enemy, whether it's ISIS or anybody else, they know exactly what we're doing because we have the wrong leadership.
0.0	0.173484278074	And together, we can solve these problems that hurt us and heal America.
0.0	0.173744363713	... an agreement with the...
0.0	0.173883785984	We need a president who can solve our problems, bring us together.
0.0	0.173898216906	And the politicians always say it is so complicated, nobody but a politician can figure it out.
0.0	0.174257391256	Think about it.
0.0	0.174257391256	Think about it.
0.0	0.174485447461	Edward Snowden is a traitor.
0.0	0.174551616634	They are more likely to know what's happening in their families and their communities, and they need to feel not just invited, but welcomed within the American society.
0.0	0.174634659338	Now, what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next.
0.0	0.174749280642	I don't know where you...
0.0	0.174766713185	The government ought to wear a striped shirt and just make sure the game...
0.0	0.174817754979	And when I look at Washington today, we need to bring us together.
0.0	0.175078518731	You know why?
0.0	0.175078518731	You know why?
0.0	0.175114924947	Let's hope that it holds.
0.0	0.175214942224	So let's start -- let's start with immigration.
0.0	0.175740520603	But it is absolutely fair and necessary for Americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average American family?
0.0	0.176210741055	And wherever you are sitting Nikki, I'm a friend.
0.0	0.176324681597	This is the only time I've had a chance, let me finish.
0.0	0.176548041335	... and sign an agreement that makes sure that the world knows that they will have technological superiority.
0.0	0.176560165744	There's -- look, there's --
0.0	0.177412742168	Their family is waiting for them.
0.0	0.177449807836	My sister was a single mom, both of my aunts who were a single moms.
0.0	0.177962751812	We need to make sure that people understand, as Jeb said before, that if you've done extraordinarily well in this country, do you want them to take more out of your taxes now and think they're gonna give it back to you later?
0.0	0.178027835054	I like that.
0.0	0.17809609616	How about we get the government to do what they're supposed to be doing, secure our borders, protect our people, and support American values and American families.
0.0	0.178312116408	Look, we have to stop with political correctness.
0.0	0.178680227256	And if you really want to believe that you can get your voice back, I will tell you, as I have all my career, I will continue to fight for you, because you're the ones that built this country, and will carry it into the future.
0.0	0.178781395071	And, when I hear people talking about means testing, let's just remember what that means.
0.0	0.178848572562	We need a president that doesn't just talk a game, but a president that's got real results.
0.0	0.178880482544	We hear a lot of good plans.
0.0	0.179248583198	We are all frustrated with what China is doing.
0.0	0.179356224698	But I like to be unpredictable so that people don't know exactly... (LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.17937364293	But I think it is really unfair to suggest that I have not been supportive of the president.
0.0	0.179388932086	And here in Wisconsin, I want to reiterate: We've got to stand up for unions and working people who have done it before...
0.0	0.179439785554	I win.
0.0	0.179526923555	And it's important that people really look hard at what the threats and dangers we face are, and who is best prepared for dealing with them.
0.0	0.179778872774	I'll say this.
0.0	0.179787997356	And the same goes for overseas, where we have to put together a coalition of Muslim nations.
0.0	0.180037837221	Wait for what?
0.0	0.180320721068	Well, Maria, I'm glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what's going on in the world.
0.0	0.180341349989	We elected someone as president who wants to change America, who wants to make it more like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.180497214895	Bad by those in the Senate who voted for it and if I'm president, we'll make our intelligence community strong, and won't have to keep everybody out, we're just going to keep the bad folk out and make sure they don't harm us.
0.0	0.180531636184	We need to rebuild our families.
0.0	0.180610717712	I have a debt to America I'll never repay.
0.0	0.180723508465	That's what we need.
0.0	0.18083809939	So let's support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition.
0.0	0.180851206988	But in 2008, we elected a president that didn't want to fix America.
0.0	0.181132201005	We're going to be tough at the border, we're going to be tough on all of the illegal immigrants that everybody else in this field -- we're going to be different.
0.0	0.181277731534	And I'm glad I did it.
0.0	0.181309704438	It's what I've done or not done, or it's war.
0.0	0.181426294492	You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president...
0.0	0.181626048526	They're not my ideas, and I don't necessarily agree with all of them.
0.0	0.181841175029	That's for sure.
0.0	0.181893740174	That's absurd, and I think people who don't want to fix it, really, or unwilling to take the chance to say, "something has to change," are missing the boat here.
0.0	0.181905541726	So I'm doing great.
0.0	0.182395979093	And when they let me down, if they let me down, I never forgive.
0.0	0.183124424434	And that's why we must make sure we continue to frack.
0.0	0.183298623112	And Bernie Sanders will tell them that it's because of the rich.
0.0	0.183730626225	I'm running for president to knock down all the barriers that are holding Americans back, and to rebuild the ladders of opportunity that will give every American a chance to advance, especially those who have been left out and left behind.
0.0	0.183993744738	So you know what needs to happen, it's a very simple equation, and it's going to happen when I'm president.
0.0	0.184374252699	We need to control the border, we need to do all of this in a comprehensive way, not just going back and forth and talking about stuff --
0.0	0.184649116267	And we need to make that very clear to everybody.
0.0	0.18485266428	And here's why.
0.0	0.184974484297	... president of the United States has got to do, and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility, is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe.
0.0	0.184985148666	You find me...
0.0	0.185194671925	Crony capitalism is what happens when government gets so big and so powerful that only the big and the powerful can handle it.
0.0	0.185226495699	I think we should do both.
0.0	0.185413894586	I think it is fair to say, whatever the complaints that you want to make about him are, that with respect to China, one of the most challenging relationships we have, his opening up China and his ongoing relationships with the leaders of China is an incredibly useful relationship for the United States of America.
0.0	0.185457241179	But my wife is down here in the front, and I'm sure, if you'd like to talk to her later, she can give you more than you'll ever be able to take care of.
0.0	0.185615516182	Thank you.
0.0	0.185615516182	Thank you.
0.0	0.185615516182	Thank you.
0.0	0.185615516182	Thank you.
0.0	0.185615516182	Thank you.
0.0	0.185615516182	Thank you.
0.0	0.185615516182	Thank you.
0.0	0.185615516182	Thank you.
0.0	0.185615516182	Thank you.
0.0	0.185615516182	Thank you.
0.0	0.185615516182	Thank you.
0.0	0.185615516182	Thank you.
0.0	0.185615516182	Thank you.
0.0	0.185615516182	Thank you.
0.0	0.185615516182	Thank you.
0.0	0.185615516182	Thank you.
0.0	0.18578213149	And, you know, we have a whole variety of things that they can do and they can do these things simultaneously.
0.0	0.18578782303	And the fact is that that's not a democracy.
0.0	0.186003382906	You've got a bit of experience, I would imagine.
0.0	0.186368547337	And, PBS, thank you.
0.0	0.186650433075	And for the life of me, I have no understanding why the president thinks that everything is going well.
0.0	0.186700732325	There'll be people here that will talk about what they're going to do.
0.0	0.186795688652	But the real -- but I think we have to get back to what this election has to be about.
0.0	0.187007387869	You know, we have to stop this because, you know, if we manage to damage ourselves, and we lose the next election, and a progressive gets in there and they get two or three Supreme Court picks, this nation is over as we know it.
0.0	0.188033066961	Listen, I want to just comment.
0.0	0.188080119867	We're going to create a border.
0.0	0.188176086045	Or somebody else.
0.0	0.188389452802	And I think the focus ought to be on making sure that we leave this nomination process, as wild and woolly as it's going to be -- this is not being bad.
0.0	0.18849271373	They know.
0.0	0.18890013894	... the fact is -- the fact is the reason why that no one wants to answer entitlements up here is because it's hard.
0.0	0.18906132481	And I'm glad that I have a chance to answer this question.
0.0	0.18926342993	So we need new leadership -- yes.
0.0	0.189727363311	In my administration, we will help to make sure we bring people together in the Middle East, and we will fight ISIS and defeat them.
0.0	0.189883289295	It is a complicated relationship.
0.0	0.190004224564	Maria, Neil, thank you for a great debate tonight.
0.0	0.190075154433	CRUZL But I will say --
0.0	0.190209753914	I'm very proud.
0.0	0.190225641132	I think if it doesn't...
0.0	0.190231296791	There have been some good recommendations about what needs to happen.
0.0	0.190295992956	in particular.
0.0	0.190653880609	At the same time, law enforcement understands there are people in the community who not only think that the system doesn't work for them, but works against them.
0.0	0.190864370682	We need a leader who will lead the resurgence of this great nation and unlock its potential once again.
0.0	0.190891955096	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.190891955096	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.190910246244	It is not a suggestion.
0.0	0.191089911894	Yes, they've got to get out of Syria.
0.0	0.191513151267	We need somebody who can lead.
0.0	0.191538669061	That's what I've done in Louisiana, that's what I'll do in America.
0.0	0.191592671565	There's something going on and it's bad.
0.0	0.191768350055	So if we want to pick and choose -- and I certainly do -- people I listen to, people I don't listen to, people I listen to for certain areas, then I think we have to be fair and look at the entire world, because it's a big, complicated world out there.
0.0	0.192232395503	Makes it a whole lot easier for them to want to go somewhere else.
0.0	0.192821947212	I think to be commander in chief in the 21st century requires someone who understands how the economy works, someone who understands how the world works and who's in it; I know more world leaders on the stage today than anyone running, with the possible exception of Hillary Clinton; understands bureaucracies, how to cut them down to size and hold them accountable; and understands technology, which is a tool, but it's also a weapon that's being used against us.
0.0	0.192957299634	Big government favors the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected, and crushes the small and the powerless.
0.0	0.193106224856	You don't want to hear the answer.
0.0	0.19316936401	We don't need to add new rules, we need to make sure the FBI does its job.
0.0	0.19327203865	Our friends no longer think we have their back and our enemies no longer fear us, and we're in a much difficult -- we're in a much different position than we should be.
0.0	0.193513553372	You see, because if you really want to get to a balanced budget, you need to reduce your expenses and you need to grow your economy.
0.0	0.193875331609	He doesn't meet -- here's the difference.
0.0	0.19395293222	But what happens if, God forbid, the next Barack Obama takes over, and the next Nancy Pelosi, and the next Harry Reid...
0.0	0.194172652726	The answer is yes.
0.0	0.194177976898	So we need 1,000.
0.0	0.194216426085	I think that sets us apart from a lot of what's happening right now on the Republican side.
0.0	0.194685620414	But if we elect the right person -- if you elect me -- we will turn this country around, we will reclaim the American dream and this nation will be stronger and greater than it has ever been.
0.0	0.194876815875	It's true.
0.0	0.194888750828	I think you're --
0.0	0.195101729369	They're Muslim.
0.0	0.19527796995	Okay.
0.0	0.195595548471	Thank you for that question.
0.0	0.195898772391	Think about that.
0.0	0.195979635024	Well, I would really appreciate that.
0.0	0.195985105784	Well, to start with, unlike President Obama, I'll actually name the enemy that we confront.
0.0	0.196556940773	So here's this -- the situation, I think, Maria.
0.0	0.196794975034	And if I were the prosecutor, that is exactly where they would be.
0.0	0.196806420973	But I look at this country today, and I look at how divided we are, I look at how politicians are always posturing and issuing sound bites but never solving problems.
0.0	0.196957854797	Anybody who tells me that we need every penny and every one of those is in a fantasy world.
0.0	0.197170392813	This is an interesting point when you talk about immigration.
0.0	0.197194650842	I want to speak to all of those maddened by political correctness, where Hillary Clinton apologizes for saying all lives matter.
0.0	0.197244782318	I know the Democrats have the ultimate SuperPac.
0.0	0.197311879855	Let me translate that for you.
0.0	0.197427206959	We have to get the remaining 10.
0.0	0.197520347563	If you make your president, I'm going to put the country ahead of the party.
0.0	0.197704616439	If I'm president, there won't be stupid deals anymore.
0.0	0.19776426641	Play by the rules.
0.0	0.198329341393	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.198329341393	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.198409304106	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.198580985074	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.198580985074	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.198832187977	Because -- because Donald's mother was born in Scotland.
0.0	0.198912407702	Well, let me -- let me first of all talk a little bit about my experience.
0.0	0.198993822116	That is who I'm fighting for.
0.0	0.19941116	And I think that ought to be worth something.
0.0	0.199432181061	Turns out that the African-American community and the Latino community were hit especially hard.
0.0	0.199436910754	It's not fear and terror, it's reality.
0.0	0.199482562759	And, I'll do that with the country.
0.0	0.199556579498	Well, I want to know, did you win?
0.0	0.199864673782	So I don't know if you would call that a weakness, but my wife said "let up."
0.0	0.199889318116	Neil, I was mentioned too.
0.0	0.199972534087	You know, everyone here talks about the need to take on Washington.
0.0	0.200094002607	And if I am elected president, to every soldier and sailor and airman and marine, and to every police officer and firefighter and first responder who risk their lives to keep us safe, I will have your back.
0.0	0.200199420576	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.200199420576	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.200719703237	I know this, I certainly am.
0.0	0.200727787047	And if we want to try to rebuild the coalition, as Governor Kasich was saying before, then what we better do is to get to the Arab countries that believe that ISIS is a threat, not only to them, but to us and to world peace, and bring them together.
0.0	0.200739904901	I have a feeling it's going to work out, actually.
0.0	0.200787989612	Good question, but I want to tell you, my great concern is that we are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job.
0.0	0.201391469229	I think he's tapped into an anger that people feel.
0.0	0.201779495467	He has got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.202010452314	We need to re-establish the relationships with the Sunnis.
0.0	0.202289941791	You want to talk about what we're going to be up against next year?
0.0	0.202353422691	You know that.
0.0	0.202415564898	So, it's going to be my responsibility to make sure we move forward to solve these problems that are now out in the open.
0.0	0.20249544904	I think we need to do a lot more than we're doing.
0.0	0.202662270437	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.202726682251	Neil...
0.0	0.20278590927	I like it.
0.0	0.202788013035	I think he would have been right.
0.0	0.202821262116	And God bless America.
0.0	0.202845784014	And our adversaries continue to grow stronger.
0.0	0.202917687935	His family certainly believes that.
0.0	0.20334657624	This president and John Kerry and Hillary Clinton all have made it harder for the next president to act, but he must act to confront the ambitions of Iran.
0.0	0.203488572107	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you better get rid of the SuperPacs because they causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that have been made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.203660668745	Well, there's no question that ISIS is a very serious problem, and I don't believe that this administration recognizes how serious it is.
0.0	0.203738302297	You know, we -- we agree that we've got to get unaccountable money out of politics.
0.0	0.20401893391	I think he is right.
0.0	0.204109735453	...Chris...
0.0	0.204109735453	...Chris...
0.0	0.204125463046	But getting back to Martha's question about how we end dependency, do we have to have a cultural change?
0.0	0.204199680021	And -- and I guess I can -- can frame it another way.
0.0	0.20429540926	But let's not kid ourselves.
0.0	0.204364151602	As we speak, there are new problems on the horizon.
0.0	0.204608394269	And so he undermines the Constitution, and he undermines free enterprise by expanding government, and he betrays our allies and cuts deals with our enemies and guts our military.
0.0	0.204959900894	The only reason why you're doing it now is because we're running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.
0.0	0.204995858952	We don't win.
0.0	0.205213750932	But I want to go further.
0.0	0.205229085372	And you know, he's right.
0.0	0.205322391287	Finally, we'll take off the political handcuffs.
0.0	0.205406926518	Maria, I'd just like to say...
0.0	0.205487967708	No, it's true.
0.0	0.205510929885	Well, I'm glad you asked that, Maria.
0.0	0.205532397911	And you can go get it at jeb2016.com.
0.0	0.205539849834	We will rebuild the military to make sure that it is a solid force, not to be the world's policeman, but to make sure that in a peaceful world, people know that the United States is there to take care of our own national interests and take care of our allies.
0.0	0.20570353804	And I want to make this our government.
0.0	0.205900494241	I do, however, believe in Reagan's 11th commandment, and will not be engaging in awful things about my compatriots here.
0.0	0.205982096666	Hardworking immigrant families living in fear, who should be brought out of the shadows so they and their children can have a better future.
0.0	0.206270206015	Do we have answer for that?
0.0	0.206536670857	We have to do something.
0.0	0.206727491725	So we have a disagreement on this.
0.0	0.207097818274	Let's quit making it a problem for them.
0.0	0.207234040133	And you look around, and you see what's happening, and this is not the case when he introduced the doctor -- very nice, everything perfect but that is not representative of what you have in that line of migration.
0.0	0.207258182401	We need to rebuild our military, and this president has let it diminish to a point where tinpot dictators like the mullahs in Iran are taking our Navy ships.
0.0	0.207495918112	So yeah, someone who makes more money...
0.0	0.207588304785	But it doesn't change my view that we need to empower everyone, women and men, to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make.
0.0	0.207684400428	Well, sure.
0.0	0.207724015474	We just want to be the rich."
0.0	0.208147311197	He wants to change America.
0.0	0.208208332424	What are the rules on who gets to follow up.
0.0	0.208441121166	All of those things are important, and all those things would happen in a Christie administration.
0.0	0.208496349238	You get together.
0.0	0.208520032059	If an American missionary has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.208653396215	It never happens.
0.0	0.208653396215	It never happens.
0.0	0.208717382481	If that's not hypocrisy, I don't know what hypocrisy is.
0.0	0.209161708025	Well, Maria, thank you for that question, and let me say thank you to the state of South Carolina for welcoming us.
0.0	0.21017595659	Now, let me ask you a question everybody, and, this is for the guy, you know, who owns a landscaping business out there.
0.0	0.210470447791	What else we can do is that we should believe in science.
0.0	0.210836293978	And, yes, people we may disagree with on a number of things may have some insight, may have some relationships that are important for the president to understand in order to best protect the United States.
0.0	0.210917731744	What we have to start thinking about, as leaders, particularly in government, is what can we do for the average American?
0.0	0.21106513922	Let me start -- I want to get to the substance of the question on jobs, but I want to start with something.
0.0	0.211089312611	The D.C. politicians continue to make things worse.
0.0	0.211134539765	But what he's touching -- talking about, I think has got merit.
0.0	0.21123597942	Make our police officers proud of what they do but more important than that, let them know how proud we are of them."
0.0	0.211480736966	I'll tell you how optimistic I am about America.
0.0	0.211729248008	We're going to make a really dynamic economy from what we have right now, which is not at all dynamic.
0.0	0.211972843076	But look...
0.0	0.2120485652	We have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9/11, and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks, yet we see the terrible attack in San Bernardino and know that we haven't done enough.
0.0	0.21207849135	It's time for us to stand up for what we believe in.
0.0	0.212561286528	And you don't go tell Muslim nations you want them to be part of a coalition when you have a leading candidate for president of the United States who insults their religion.
0.0	0.212824736717	A lot of interesting issues have come together.
0.0	0.212824851517	What we have to do is end over-policing in African- American neighborhoods.
0.0	0.212833030845	But the leaders have come forward to realize that protest is fine, but violence is wrong.
0.0	0.212861298456	It's time for real substance and real experience.
0.0	0.212925727769	... with what Marco is saying is that it takes too long, they're sucking us dry and it takes too long.
0.0	0.212952379023	... and as president, I'm going to fight for the working men and women.
0.0	0.213152942318	Republicans and Democrats alike believe this.
0.0	0.213227415975	The answer is no.
0.0	0.213551516696	But the reason America is a great country, the reason is because our compassion is in our laws.
0.0	0.213625296313	And it's especially significant that they are working with both Turkey and Greece in order to do this.
0.0	0.213736911683	You know, every election we hear a lot of talk.
0.0	0.213852857678	What I said was I don't believe that I would be president of the United States and have the same dysfunction that exists in Washington, D.C. now.
0.0	0.214387079404	And that doesn't have to be true.
0.0	0.214661100743	You know, I -- my -- my mother taught me this.
0.0	0.214840734602	... replacing dependency with opportunity.
0.0	0.214860914231	Our country rise up again, but we need to have a compelling conservative agenda that we present to the American people in a way that doesn't disparage people, that unites us around our common purpose.
0.0	0.215030130523	Well, first of all, recognize it is a substantial problem.
0.0	0.215297534218	We know this for a fact.
0.0	0.21537070011	I mean, Chris will know about that.
0.0	0.215378697228	It is an agenda, in my view, that would do great harm to our country.
0.0	0.215686567185	I say, yes, not only do we give them what they need, but we don't tie their hands behind their backs so that they can go ahead and get the job done.
0.0	0.215762964641	Well, you're talking about -- yeah.
0.0	0.215785617841	It was a coalition made up of Arabs and Americans and westerners and we're going to need it again.
0.0	0.215911201394	Conservatives, I am a conservative because I believe no one of us is any better than any other one of us.
0.0	0.215938075446	Here's my second problem.
0.0	0.215963064479	You didn't see it for a minute.
0.0	0.215979604582	I am a conservative; I can win this job, I can do this job, I need your help, I need your support.
0.0	0.215980815565	Here's the thing that I would ask Donald Trump in all seriousness.
0.0	0.216016811794	That is a bad deal and an evil situation, and presidents have looked the other way.
0.0	0.216095967112	So if you happen to be right, you could get the top job at the end of the day.
0.0	0.216151283111	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.216234587696	They get -- they steal them.
0.0	0.216440526005	I totally get that.
0.0	0.21652002015	For a start, the secretary and I disagree -- and I think the president does not agree with her -- in terms of the concept of a no-fly zone in Syria.
0.0	0.216781588388	Because if you are, you need to elect someone who's deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.216831881071	And they wonder whether somebody is getting something to -- keeping them from getting it.
0.0	0.217208495987	And listen, there are many, many wonderful, wonderful working men and women in the state of New York.
0.0	0.217355747372	He doesn't want to get people together, the old-fashioned way, where you get Congress.
0.0	0.217491694676	Why weren't they vigilant?
0.0	0.21753514005	We're going to start the process of securing that border.
0.0	0.217653853289	And let's not let the secular progressives drive that out of us.
0.0	0.217702473313	QUICK: Governor, thank you.
0.0	0.217899073521	Some do, but many Americans are dying to have an opportunity to grow and to create something inside this economy.
0.0	0.217982085776	I'm going to do it for America.
0.0	0.218130420497	And you know, when you see Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and all the Democrats talking about wanting to address the plight of working women, not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama, 3.7 million women have entered poverty.
0.0	0.218458612194	They can have it anyway you want.
0.0	0.218499357674	He doesn't understand the threat in ISIS.
0.0	0.218762157133	This is what's going on.
0.0	0.21894168095	If people are promising they're going to take on Washington and cronyism, you need to look to who has been doing it.
0.0	0.219378424256	Neil, the problem...
0.0	0.219452037219	If you elect me president of the United States, I will secure that southern border.
0.0	0.219756043364	I mean, just think about a scenario like that.
0.0	0.219781345066	And listen, there is a real difference between Marco's tax plan and mine.
0.0	0.219782143131	What would motivate me and what would be the guiding light for me in terms of immigration reform, Judy, is to bring families together, not divide them up.
0.0	0.220045561864	Liberty thrives when government is small.
0.0	0.220378222637	Big difference.
0.0	0.220491463948	I want to -- before my time runs out I want to get back to this issue of ISIS versus Iran.
0.0	0.220512381975	I think I'm going to win fair and square (inaudible) to win this way.
0.0	0.220547277078	Whatever it takes, as long as it takes, to defeat them.
0.0	0.220876296336	And when it comes to the issues that are really on the front lines as to whether we're going to have equal pay, paid family leave, some opportunity for, you know, women to go as far as their hard work and talent take them, I think that we still have some barriers to knock down, which is why that's at the core of my campaign.
0.0	0.22101302315	We're gutting our military, and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were.
0.0	0.221090499142	Let's listen to them and let's not listen to our politicians.
0.0	0.221291313432	It's not that hard.
0.0	0.221299913923	Well, I don't know if it's a blind trust if Ivanka, Don and Eric run it.
0.0	0.221308593803	Look, here is the reality, folks.
0.0	0.221309918163	And what I have said is I will not throw us further into debt.
0.0	0.221656964222	I love China.
0.0	0.221758317819	It's like a tariff, but here's the difference: if we impose a tariff, China responds.
0.0	0.221804866537	And then what he did is redefine the role of government.
0.0	0.222276042039	And our economy was growing like crazy.
0.0	0.222332502845	And why?
0.0	0.222419812577	And what we want to do is to control this.
0.0	0.222565875033	I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators -- back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.
0.0	0.22281156117	Judy, if I can, there is no question, Secretary Clinton and I are friends, and I have a lot of respect for her, that she has enormous experience in foreign affairs.
0.0	0.222947003597	I look at Washington, and I hear the talk, and I see the promises and it seems nothing ever changes.
0.0	0.223255122879	And I believe people need a leader who is prepared to make tough calls in tough times and stand up...
0.0	0.223402001023	And I just couldn't agree -- disagree more with those kinds of comments.
0.0	0.223504503079	I will do that.
0.0	0.223554922304	When it comes to ISIS, we will not weaken them, we will not degrade them, we will utterly and completely destroy ISIS
0.0	0.223873286132	We didn't spend any.
0.0	0.223992803302	...eliminates the business...
0.0	0.224070808371	People are waking up because it is going to be us who will determine the direction of our country.
0.0	0.224096375287	He does great.
0.0	0.224320236029	And, then we have to go after sentencing, and that's one of the problems here in Wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn't happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level.
0.0	0.22458508914	Get over that one, OK?
0.0	0.224615601937	Maria...
0.0	0.224632534395	Because I've done it.
0.0	0.224741331954	We need someone to fight for the people.
0.0	0.224795554541	One of them being that if you don't have some agreement within the system from states and from families and from students, it's hard to get to where we need to go.
0.0	0.224802794246	If you're not willing to do that, nobody wants to do it, but if you're not willing to gradually raise the age, you're not serious about fixing either one of them.
0.0	0.225064424087	That is not what America should be about.
0.0	0.225212925584	Folks, you want to --
0.0	0.225324636497	But the Democrats are going to bring a lawsuit, and you have to have certainty.
0.0	0.225402816734	Here's the truth.
0.0	0.225500838061	Community has to understand that that police officer wants to get home at night, and not -- not to lose their life.
0.0	0.225552604185	Because, folks, at the end of the day, the country needs healed.
0.0	0.225600177731	I have Ivanka, and Eric and Don sitting there.
0.0	0.225630871722	And you had better get rid of them, because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.22567643853	We're friends.
0.0	0.225796438616	And this big powerful, corrupt bureaucracy works now only for the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected.
0.0	0.226047986095	Alright.
0.0	0.226085832461	I will change the culture in Washington, just as I changed the culture in Tallahassee.
0.0	0.226086618367	Our decision is, then, do we give them what we need.
0.0	0.22638710458	If they don't treat us fairly, hey, their whole trade is tariffed.
0.0	0.226489312963	I do not believe that we need to wholesale destroy every American citizen's privacy in order to go after those that we know are suspect or are -- are already a problem.
0.0	0.22657217738	Now Maria, listen.
0.0	0.226619005604	And there's a reason why Hillary's supporters are echoing Donald's attacks on me, because Hillary...
0.0	0.226807349759	Thank you all very much.
0.0	0.226831173106	We need a nominee who is going to throw every punch, not pull punches, and someone who cannot stumble before he even gets into the ring.
0.0	0.227064818566	Hey, I'm in the United States Senate, and anyone who doesn't think that there is an enormous amount of waste and inefficiency and bureaucracy throughout government would be very, very mistaken.
0.0	0.227341530086	I'm going to do what it takes to defend this nation.
0.0	0.227371336874	They can solve the problem of North Korea if they wanted to but they taunt us.
0.0	0.227687395403	It is undermining American democracy.
0.0	0.2277006346	There is a great deal of skepticism about the federal government.
0.0	0.22772863474	With Saudi Arabia and oil production, first of all, it's so critical for us to be energy independent, and we're getting there because of fracking and we ought to explore because, see, energy independence gives us leverage and flexibility, and secondly, if you want to bring jobs back to the United States of America in industry, low prices make the difference.
0.0	0.227849770409	If i were the president of the United States, I would go and look at every executive order that exists right now and determine which ones want to be voided, because the president shouldn't be legislating: not through that vehicle or any other.
0.0	0.227970224699	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.227970224699	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.228007910094	Eradicate those and you fix Medicare and you've fixed America, its economy and you've made people's lives a heck of a lot better.
0.0	0.228306700283	But I was born here.
0.0	0.228573474994	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.228706735273	(LAUGHTER) I'll tell you what.
0.0	0.229035977743	We will renew America if we work together, and I am totally confident that we will.
0.0	0.229299897785	I'll suggest a part of that was his celebrity.
0.0	0.229306759125	Think back to Garland, Texas.
0.0	0.229344354893	The way to take that away from them is to talk to our military officials and ask them, "what do you need in order to accomplish this goal?"
0.0	0.229403910786	You know, America doesn't owe me anything.
0.0	0.229417443216	You've got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.229529884295	This guy is a petulant child.
0.0	0.229543479731	We have a tremendous problem.
0.0	0.229602069913	I mean, you know...
0.0	0.229760581472	Ohio, one of the best growing places in the country -- I not only did it in Washington, I did it in Ohio, and I'll go back to Washington, and there will be no more silly deals...
0.0	0.22980868682	But you know, here's the real issue, is this America anymore?
0.0	0.229818092682	That's what he talked about, the great threat of China.
0.0	0.230056652882	Why is that?
0.0	0.230152702098	... who got us out of that...
0.0	0.230266381897	That debate reflected a debate between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks.
0.0	0.230270519196	They haven't done that.
0.0	0.230415295354	But we have a serious problem.
0.0	0.230430909417	We hear all this discussion about well, I would do this, or I would do that, when the fact is, the border is still porous.
0.0	0.230477794586	Yeah, he said everybody.
0.0	0.23048822605	And I ask you to join me in truth and honesty and integrity.
0.0	0.230519953875	We need to have stronger families.
0.0	0.230620018912	This is the fantasy that I talked about in the beginning.
0.0	0.230648593128	And this is one of the myths that the left perpetrates on our society, and this is how they frighten people and get people to shut up.
0.0	0.230699319688	... and I know Bernie, and I can promise you he's not going to be president of the United States.
0.0	0.230845860232	And as president of the United States, it's all about communication, folks.
0.0	0.230934174194	It's a joke.
0.0	0.231324956074	Creativity.
0.0	0.231332730308	You want me to answer that question?
0.0	0.231582606441	This is 2016.
0.0	0.231604391546	You just want to...
0.0	0.231686154577	You are working at McDonald's?
0.0	0.231710435076	And that's what we should focus on is the violence in our communities.
0.0	0.231802390496	I'll give you a fact.
0.0	0.231949754448	... so you don't actually want to hear the answer, John?
0.0	0.231985869812	We are trying to bring America together around an agenda that works for working families and the middle class.
0.0	0.232013073223	Because that's what we'd get if it were Jeb -- I tell you what, we don't need that.
0.0	0.232197430737	We have got to make sure that local police departments look like the communities they serve in their diversity.
0.0	0.232346484205	And, we come out here, and we do our thing.
0.0	0.232469322969	You've got to have a clear vision of where you want to go.
0.0	0.232516727763	And on this issue of the Medicare in particular, it's important because they're going to demagogue what we're saying here tonight.
0.0	0.232554248884	We have a -- they say there's no bipartisanship in Washington?
0.0	0.232568381306	It is Iran that's the expansionist power.
0.0	0.23273150273	Now, we're going to blame the people.
0.0	0.232747639471	And let me be clear.
0.0	0.232846590463	And some of them, I will say, not all, have called me and said, "Donald, thank you very much; you're exposing an unbelievable problem and we have to get to the bottom of it."
1.0	0.232954299167	Well, there's not question that we should be able to look at past president whether they're married to somebody who's running for president or not in terms of their past behavior and what it means.
0.0	0.232959014511	Neil, my name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.233312541002	Recognize that the caliphate is what gives them the legitimacy to go out on a jihadist mission, so we need to take that away from them.
0.0	0.233467775406	But I think this is a worldwide -- that the entire world needs to come together to deal with this horrific refugee crisis we're seeing from Syria and Afghanistan, as well.
0.0	0.23362223148	And that's why we're in the trouble that we're in now.
0.0	0.233690369058	China and Russia have never been on our side of the table.
0.0	0.233969433052	I will not do that.
0.0	0.233991085883	Not the change we need at a time we need it.
0.0	0.234311613492	I want to speak to all the moms and dads whose sons and daughters are fighting for this country, and the incredible sense of betrayal when you have a commander-in-chief who will not even speak the name of our enemy, radical Islamic terrorism, when you have a commander-in- chief who sends $150 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, who's responsible for murdering hundreds of our servicemen and women.
0.0	0.234362487098	Well, when you look at the celebrity of Donald Trump, then I think that says a lot about it.
0.0	0.23440543598	The Kurds are our strongest allies.
0.0	0.234561539798	This deal in Washington is an example of why Washington's broken.
0.0	0.234668209842	Take it from Lawrence Tribe.
0.0	0.234777561999	We had Hamas.
0.0	0.234899944809	Let me tell you who Larry Tribe is.
0.0	0.235031734511	John, I'll tell you something.
0.0	0.235033375702	That's the side we need to be on, and that's the side of the bulk of the -- of the Middle East.
0.0	0.235086344585	But I know who the pessimist is.
0.0	0.235100187927	...Or, even some famous Colorado brownies.
0.0	0.235123455307	Well, this is one of the reasons why Tom Perkins and I had disagreements in the boardroom, Becky.
0.0	0.235166783169	But I think they will see a very good option here.
0.0	0.235215212688	And you talk so much that nobody can ever keep up with what you're saying is accurate or not.
0.0	0.235247892089	We have Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view.
0.0	0.235250024641	Number -- and that is important for you to know.
0.0	0.235377122005	And at that point, it's a life that we have the right to protect, and I think we should protect.
0.0	0.235494807332	Carl said, "no, no -- " but he's somebody -- these are the kind of people that we should use to negotiate and not the China people that we have who are political hacks who don't know what they're doing and we have problems like this.
0.0	0.235516431492	I'll check for you.
0.0	0.235636444846	I will do everything I can to make certain that the United States and our brave men and women in the military do not get bogged down in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.
0.0	0.235911260116	I'm tired of seeing what's going on, between the border where the people flow over; people come in; they live; they shoot.
0.0	0.235944801496	It will never happen because they'll let their currency go up.
0.0	0.235988714855	I'm happy to answer the question...
0.0	0.236048420071	When I am president, I will work consistently every single day to keep this country safe, not call Edward Snowden, as you did, a great public servant.
0.0	0.236331930129	... he's really doing some bad...
0.0	0.236345336714	What a president of the United States has got to do -- and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility -- is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe, that we work with allies around the world to protect...
0.0	0.236418104822	And then the Government steps in to try and solve the problem and we get a little further down to that progressive vision that Hillary Clinton is talking about.
0.0	0.236468737228	So you should go out, get a declaratory judgment, let the courts decide.
0.0	0.236519939238	If you're running for president of the United States and you don't understand that we need more American ground forces in Iraq and that America has to be part of a regional ground force that will go into Syria and destroy ISIL in Syria, then you're not ready to be commander in chief.
0.0	0.236818581652	You see, folks, this is how socialism starts.
0.0	0.236841605864	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.236961924921	Someone who's going to stand up, and be very clear with our enemies as to the lines their going to draw and stand with them.
0.0	0.237018019807	I don't like that.
0.0	0.237018019807	They don't like that.
0.0	0.237138832349	It turns out some dot wasn't connected, and so the first thing we have to do is make sure that everyone and every responsible agency is attuned to all of these possibilities and symptoms.
0.0	0.237438047207	Americans are tired of hearing this debate -- want to go to, what are you going to do about illegal immigration?
0.0	0.237692357445	So, you know, we'll take our progress wherever we can find it.
0.0	0.237929345142	They're leaving because of taxes, but they are also leaving because they can't get their money back and everybody agrees, Democrats and Republicans, that is should come back in.
0.0	0.238335898267	As a result of his efforts and the efforts of Joe Biden against unprecedented, I was there in the Senate, unprecedented Republican obstructionism, we have made enormous progress.
0.0	0.238362632012	Well, Gwen and Judy, thank you very much for hosting this event.
0.0	0.238605264859	So listen, this is the difference between being a governor and a senator.
0.0	0.238659678787	And I also want to recognize the people in that church that showed the grace of God and the grace of forgiveness and the mercy that they showed.
0.0	0.238950778776	That is the fight we have to have, and we have to undo a whole set of things that President Obama has done that get at the heart of his disrespect and disregard for too many Americans.
0.0	0.239028125897	I believe that our Constitution protects everybody, regardless of their sexual orientation or any other aspect.
0.0	0.239188004664	They understand the vulnerabilities we have on the southern border.
0.0	0.239194023805	And he stood before the American people and he said, "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself," a profound statement that gave the American people the courage to believe that, yes, we could get out of that terrible depression.
0.0	0.239310939798	Well, let's go with three.
0.0	0.239320676947	So, we are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we have to root out in our society.
0.0	0.239374965881	And that's why 2016 is a turning point in our history.
0.0	0.239386299741	They're protectionist.
0.0	0.240065892488	We need Jordan.
0.0	0.240166237603	And when we -- and when we do that, we don't do what the Republicans want, which is to cut Social Security.
0.0	0.240192062916	The time to act is now.
0.0	0.240305739486	I'm president -- look, I've done it once.
0.0	0.240336365631	You gotta be creative and imaginative.
0.0	0.240344760614	But, you know what we're not telling them?
0.0	0.240357140503	For too long -- no, for too long, what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our people's jobs, and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us.
0.0	0.240444271581	I would hope that you would come onboard and say that this is the simple and straightforward thing to do.
0.0	0.240550118998	Excuse me, John.
0.0	0.240743171262	It is a constitutional right of every American to be able to protect themselves and their families.
0.0	0.240868570228	And if we try to put everybody in the same -- call everybody the same thing, we can't do it.
0.0	0.24088143215	-- the governor's absolutely right.
0.0	0.241080024271	So what if children are going hungry?
0.0	0.241147553625	I agree with my colleagues.
0.0	0.241231495369	He consistently underestimates it but I do not.
0.0	0.24131600144	Well, I don't know.
0.0	0.241425199017	First thing I'd tell the American people, whatever it takes to defend our nation, I would do.
0.0	0.24144527925	But the key thing that we're seeing now is serious challenges to this country that must change, the direction of this nation must change.
0.0	0.241466871409	They know that this country is pushing the middle class, the hardworking taxpayers, backwards, and they saw a president who doesn't understand their pain, and doesn't have any plan for getting away from it.
0.0	0.24155286369	I love Donald Trump.
0.0	0.24163145114	I don't -- look, I don't think anybody should be expanding Medicaid.
0.0	0.241715369207	But if you want someone who has a proven, effective leadership, that was a governor of a state, that transformed the culture there, elect me so I can fight for the American people and change the culture in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.241769633281	It is disgraceful, and in a Christie administration, they would know much, much better than to do that.
0.0	0.24189967453	I get to respond, right?
0.0	0.241919296005	That's how you solve the problem.
0.0	0.241965371707	I'm angry because our country is a mess.
0.0	0.242309060866	But now as I travel the country, people say what I feel.
0.0	0.242699541333	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.242752923678	Yes, in my view, the government of a democratic society has a moral responsibility to play a vital role in making sure all of our people have a decent standard of living.
0.0	0.242956654629	We don't have to have refugees come to our country, but all Muslims, seriously?
0.0	0.24305925888	Let's talk about something that happened this week in the news.
0.0	0.243178241227	And I'll tell you, it was heartbreaking.
0.0	0.243211141322	I've done it.
0.0	0.243464840781	Look, that's who I stand up for.
0.0	0.243472004642	You know, I see a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist.
0.0	0.243484490923	And the idea that this negotiation -- I will tell you one thing.
0.0	0.243713955777	The fact is -- and if for some reason he beats the rest of the field, he beats the rest of the field (inaudible).
0.0	0.244103663886	Divisive and with no vision.
0.0	0.244247694194	And secondly, when you talk about me being on the board of Lehman Brothers, I wasn't on the board of Lehman Brothers.
0.0	0.244287481693	Just want to get that out there, just saying.
0.0	0.244421918565	Most importantly, I think I understand leadership, which sometimes requires a tough call in a tough time.
0.0	0.244492590191	We need to make sure that we do everything across all kinds of energy: natural gas, oil, absolutely.
0.0	0.244515946006	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.24466951134	Everybody's record's going to be scrutinized, and at the end of the day we need to unite behind the winner so we can defeat Hillary Clinton, because she is a disaster.
0.0	0.244971473592	So, let's stop fooling around about this, let's tell people the truth.
0.0	0.244972289648	What should we do?
0.0	0.245062686185	Many businessmen want to endorse me.
0.0	0.245346369067	That's the truth of the matter and you see it every time with this president.
0.0	0.245356912838	I'm not blaming Chris, by the way, but he will know about that.
0.0	0.245565648711	We're going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education.
0.0	0.245664070608	But the president leads in this regard.
1.0	0.245741729641	It isn't there anymore, Mike.
0.0	0.2460886837	We must insist on assimilation -- immigration without assimilation is an invasion.
0.0	0.246113029163	But on this point, if I may add something on this point.
0.0	0.246293536029	You know, let me say something at the outset.
0.0	0.246341476238	I think -- I think it's fair to say we don't have a disagreement.
0.0	0.246494146289	Secondly, as it relates to Iran, we need to confront their ambitions across the board.
0.0	0.246594277485	I believe that it's most important that we unleash the full potential of women and girls in our society.
0.0	0.246687297487	The point I'm making is this, the Federal Government should not be in a lot of things.
0.0	0.246861514924	And with your vote and your support and your prayers, I will lead with the citizens of this great nation the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.247290727365	As an outsider, I tackled H.P.
0.0	0.247347996508	We cannot elect somebody that doesn't know how to do the job.
0.0	0.247432852786	Our job has to be to recognize the conflict between the two.
0.0	0.247500243483	We have a serious problem with, as you know, with radical Islam.
0.0	0.247504912964	You want to talk about moral authority.
0.0	0.247537584323	And we need to bring our debt under control, make our economy stronger.
0.0	0.247560017085	No, they don't like he beats the rest of the field, because they want me.
0.0	0.247608972287	And you combine that with a plan to make manufacturing -- this country number one in manufacturing, you've got someone who's going to help revitalize and give hope to America, the place -- the place is that is the most hopeless today.
0.0	0.247701313389	And let me make a final point on this.
0.0	0.247877810666	I have worked for his re-election.
0.0	0.248173440629	So what we're going to have to start doing instead of, you know, picking on this group or this group, is we're going to have to have a major reduction in the regulatory influence that is going on.
0.0	0.248599924385	But everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro- gay-marriage, focus around money and the media.
0.0	0.248689030629	And when you do that, when you're in a position of managing regulations; when you reduce taxes; and when you have fiscal discipline, you see the job creators begin to get very comfortable with the fact that they can invest.
1.0	0.248793596318	You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don't agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements.
0.0	0.248879435155	It's harder to talk to your enemies.
0.0	0.248898402552	And we need to very, very concerned about that.
0.0	0.249052236229	MACCALLUM: Thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.24919536475	We have a country of borders.
0.0	0.249251906491	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.249425821088	And I believe that the best way to do that is to be aggressive, to be principled, but to have the goal of trying to improve relations.
0.0	0.24947311865	It's not only offensive; it's dangerous.
0.0	0.249477400405	You know why three?
0.0	0.249477400405	You know why three?
0.0	0.249585392696	Why?
0.0	0.249679939747	These are drags on the economy, it's a deliberate drag.
0.0	0.249828614618	We have Arab allies.
0.0	0.249859054853	We don't need that.
0.0	0.25007526873	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.250545405439	Let's let a Justice Department -- and I will make an attorney general who will enforce the law and make justice more than just a word.
0.0	0.250614751971	We need to make sure that we keep the country safe.
0.0	0.251095870599	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.25113681027	That is like shouting "fire" in a crowded theater, and that is illegal, and I would do everything in our power not just to go after those who are here who we know who are here, before they can radicalize other Americans to carry out attacks, and it's not just the ones they've arrested.
0.0	0.251146613775	Look, we are fighting for every vote that we can get from women, from men, straight, gay, African-Americans, Latinos, Asian-Americans.
0.0	0.251376583746	Well I want to comment on this.
0.0	0.251435511072	I would begin by saying that I'm not sure it's a weakness, but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for America's future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people.
0.0	0.251437775217	That we do all that we can to create a world of peace and prosperity.
0.0	0.251486826485	There are a lot of people living paycheck to paycheck in Florida as well, they're looking for a senator that will fight for them each and every day.
0.0	0.251594630334	And...
0.0	0.251594630334	But...
0.0	0.252152281993	But, here is the truth.
0.0	0.252189336021	Look, the truth is that a powerful nation like the United States, certainly working with our allies, we can overthrow dictators all over the world.
0.0	0.252492645589	So whether it's green cards or any other form of entry into America, when I'm president if we do not know who you are or why you are coming, you are not going to get into the United States of America.
0.0	0.252575488884	You're welcome.
0.0	0.252624713475	Also, when you look at these videos, they are horrific and show just a hideous disrespect for life.
0.0	0.25266092458	And yes, I am angry.
0.0	0.25268336878	My Muslim friends, some, said, "thank you very much; we'll get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.252990111449	So let's start by knowing where your money is being spent by the federal government.
0.0	0.253031951051	I'm very angry because our country is being run horribly and I will gladly accept the mantle of anger.
0.0	0.253573488665	If you want someone to grab a beer with, I may not be that guy.
0.0	0.25360696917	They want a political revolution in which millions of Americans stand up, come together, not let the Trumps of the world divide us, and say, you know what, in this great country, we need a government that represents all of us, not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.
0.0	0.253684439842	... his answer -- you name it.
0.0	0.254231610375	You get the Congress.
0.0	0.254290829963	So, I think gun-free zones are a catastrophe.
0.0	0.254375147317	Well, obviously, you don't understand my views on homosexuality.
0.0	0.254445135426	First of all, I'd like to recognize Governor Haley for her incredible leadership in the aftermath of the --
0.0	0.254489854745	I think he has addressed a lot of these issues that have been quite difficult, but he has gone forward.
0.0	0.254654013007	You don't solve it by big talk where you're banning all Muslims and making it harder for us to build the kind of coalition for us to be successful.
0.0	0.254862637884	Can I tell you what?
0.0	0.254871750206	So we have work to do.
0.0	0.255171206486	They have a responsibility, as well.
0.0	0.255341860705	Martha, religious liberty doesn't include encouraging a fellow American to engage in violent jihad and kill an American here.
0.0	0.255616500452	But I think I'll go back to building buildings if it doesn't work out.
0.0	0.255796469215	So yes, you're going to hear a lot of talk about tax reform --
0.0	0.255807564245	That will never happen when I am president of the United States.
0.0	0.255830035553	But I think to suggest that I have voiced criticism, this blurb that you talk about, you know what the blurb said?

0.0	0.255953545474	We need to solve problems, we need to rebuild our military so we can stand up to radical Islam, we need to get our economy growing much faster by throwing out the corrupt tax code and lowering the rates.
0.0	0.256001799723	It is a real horror.
0.0	0.256277260261	OK. You know, you judge a nation not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how you treat, we treat, the most vulnerable and fragile people in our nation.
0.0	0.256296084109	I know every one.
0.0	0.256437468483	And here's what the economic issue is.
0.0	0.25657351672	And I'll allow putting that tariff or whatever he's saying here...
0.0	0.256827472933	That's an interesting question.
0.0	0.256920069054	Now, on to your substantive question.
0.0	0.256938899495	But this is what you're seeing in the Republican debate that you didn't see in that Democrat debate.
0.0	0.25722155329	I will do that in Washington.
0.0	0.257401429564	And -- you know, all of this too big to fail stuff and picking and choosing winners and losers -- this is a bunch of crap, and it is really causing a great deal of -- great deal of problems for our society right now.
0.0	0.258078903746	And when we live by those laws and we treat everybody equally under the law, that's when people feel good about being Americans.
0.0	0.258370543443	We have to be prepared to defend the American people, prepare them for a long war, stand up for the defense of this country, and stand up for the values of this country...
0.0	0.25868342887	It's not the evil rich people.
0.0	0.258767817045	With respect to the United States, I think our role in NATO, our support for the E.U., as well as our willingness to take refugees so long as they are thoroughly vetted and that we have confidence from intelligence and other sources that they can come to our country, we should be doing our part.
0.0	0.258845882645	And unlike President Obama, where he refuses even to use the term of what's going on, he can't use the term for whatever reason.
0.0	0.258891912593	...The only way we're going to be morale, the only way we're going to keep our promise to seniors is start by following the first rule we should all follow, which is to look at them, treat them like adults, and tell them the truth.
0.0	0.258963973933	And I'll tell you, I'm not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump.
0.0	0.259141414335	Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point?
0.0	0.259216923637	But what happened is a political vacuum developed.
0.0	0.259223994479	There are politics in the boardroom as well.
0.0	0.259465578392	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.259664053052	And we got to look at the big picture here.
0.0	0.260065634324	OK.
0.0	0.260065634324	OK.
0.0	0.260065634324	OK?
0.0	0.260065634324	OK?
0.0	0.260065634324	OK?
0.0	0.260065634324	OK?
0.0	0.260638800561	And so when we talk to our allies and we give them our word, in a Christie administration, they know we're going to keep it.
0.0	0.260970022186	(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
0.0	0.261282972177	Because it wouldn't work.
0.0	0.261503386844	It can not be someone that agrees with his agenda.
0.0	0.261739175105	And that's what I hear from some people, "we'll do nothing and it will just be fixed."
0.0	0.261910274626	That's not the role of the government.
0.0	0.262011517005	You know, whatever your issue, your cause, the festering problem you hoped would resolved, the political class has failed you.
0.0	0.262162768168	I think now what I've called for is counsel for every child so that no child has to face any kind of process without someone who speaks and advocates for that child so that the right decision hopefully can be made.
0.0	0.262181505521	And Carl -- Carl, I'm not finished yet.
0.0	0.26219858963	You know, I think, again, both of us share the goal of trying to make college affordable for all young Americans.
0.0	0.26225766248	And I agree about the role that he played both in war and in peace on the economy and defeating fascism around the world.
0.0	0.262381708933	I believe we should be appointing Supreme Court justices who will follow the law and not try to make the law.
0.0	0.262430374564	I got that.
0.0	0.262445221092	That's my view.
0.0	0.262464962376	Because, I've got to tell you the truth, even in New Jersey what you're doing is called rude.
0.0	0.262529707606	They say, " well, we don't really have control."
0.0	0.262601004935	What we ought to do is tighten up our efforts to deal with the entry visa program so that a citizen from Europe, it's harder if they've been traveling to Syria or traveling to these other places where there is Islamic terrorism, make it harder -- make the screening take place.
0.0	0.262806803892	The economy was really booming.
0.0	0.262948027383	So we do as the United States have to support our friends, our allies in Europe.
0.0	0.263036179159	I agree, however, it doesn't go far enough, because what it focuses on are the big banks, which Senator Sanders has talked about a lot, for good reason.
0.0	0.263224112167	I will, with your help and support, lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.263240790249	I understand we can disagree on the path forward.
0.0	0.263309164409	I want to ask you: Are you fed up with how Washington taxes you?
0.0	0.263395013163	That's was hard work.
0.0	0.263399050295	Let me just -- let me respond.
0.0	0.263659296782	It's a hard problem.
0.0	0.26373167051	We're becoming Greece if we don't work together.
0.0	0.263833896664	Every one of us is gifted by God, whether it is those poor babies being picked over or it's someone whose life is tangled up in a web of dependence.
0.0	0.263881947918	OK. You know, the Democrats who have the ultimate super PAC, it's called the mainstream media.
0.0	0.263911525675	We have a lot of work to do with Iran before we ever say that they could move toward normalized relations with us.
0.0	0.263973766385	SuperPacs are a disaster.
0.0	0.264118120626	I will tell you this, I will beat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.264203251898	We are not the world's policeman, but we need to stand up and be ready.
0.0	0.264489492525	All we need to do is protect them, they will be in their own country.
0.0	0.264581419455	And -- and -- and I -- you know, Ben is absolutely right in saying that what we don't need to do is to send more money to Washington, D.C. to fix this problem.
0.0	0.264650542633	Well, that's easy to answer.
0.0	0.264834238235	Because the damage he has done to America is extraordinary.
0.0	0.265045249592	I would hold a Camp David summit with our Arab allies, not to talk them into this lousy deal with Iran, but to say to them, "what is it that you need to defeat ISIL?"
0.0	0.265074438224	They have to have some legal basis and precedence for being able to follow the law instead of making the law up, and my goal is -- in appointing Supreme Court justices, would be to point -- to appoint justices who would follow the law.
0.0	0.265191407459	Let me be clear.
0.0	0.265243405278	My father used to say, "Johnny, we never -- we don't hate the rich.
0.0	0.265339944636	We're going to take the political handcuffs off the military.
0.0	0.265392867954	I'd also go after these sanctuary cities, do everything we can to make sure that we are not -- that we are actually prosecuting and cutting off funding for cities that are harboring illegal aliens, and then finally making sure the IRS is not going after conservative or religious groups.
0.0	0.265804910112	He's penalized -- and doesn't understand.
0.0	0.265912257126	Those three things put together are going to give confidence to job creators and you will begin to see wages rise.
0.0	0.265982458966	I love this country.
0.0	0.266007411778	Well, yes, indeed.
0.0	0.266165421606	What we need to do is destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.266364260363	I would just say this, we've heard a lot of great ideas up here, and I agree with what Senator Rubio said.
0.0	0.266424170836	Here's the deal, Chris is totally right.
0.0	0.266450683002	(inaudible), the great majority of Republicans and Americans believe in a hopeful future.
0.0	0.266624373982	It goes in the right direction.
0.0	0.26677522861	I'm not fighting that.
0.0	0.266931644834	I'm ready.
0.0	0.267011952252	There are ways to retrain the 50 and 51-year-olds, because they've got great value.
0.0	0.267198381375	We need to embed with -- with the Iraqi military.
0.0	0.267239370192	And hopefully -- you know, Senator Graham, I -- I know where he's going to be on this, but we use Congress, and we use Congress to cut this funding.
0.0	0.267341159733	So I would -- I would be willing to do that.
0.0	0.267347822713	I'm going to keep making sure that everything I've done, everything that I stand for is going to be well known.
0.0	0.267399171024	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.267399171024	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.267408815196	Freedom is personal for me, and I will always keep my word and fight for freedom.
0.0	0.267673330575	In fact, what that hurts is hurt hardworking taxpayers.
0.0	0.267918982844	Yes.
0.0	0.267918982844	Yes.
0.0	0.267918982844	Yes.
0.0	0.267918982844	Yes.
0.0	0.268001833292	Folks, we have a problem here with the leadership in Washington, but I'll tell you another problem.
0.0	0.268423797363	And I have the feeling you're going to find a lot of cost overruns there and a lot of waste and duplicative activities.
0.0	0.268442152826	It's not only a problem here.
0.0	0.268530294831	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.268595829612	Somebody says "I'm a fighter."
1.0	0.268629048086	Our military is a disaster.
0.0	0.26863236281	Well, it's an interesting question because I'm very proud of my company.
0.0	0.269100552038	It's the people that pull the trigger and we have to find out what is going on.
0.0	0.269402226161	And wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong.
0.0	0.269409551267	We will win on everything we do.
0.0	0.26949438827	There is a war against ISIS, not just against ISIS but against radical jihadists terrorists, and it is a war that they win or we win.
0.0	0.26952292647	I'd like to just mention something about my tax plan, and how it relates to the discussion...
0.0	0.269587384349	Well, first of all, thank you all for having us.
0.0	0.269648727362	I will tell you that.
0.0	0.269881532353	He's a gifted politician.
0.0	0.269948517807	I like Marco Rubio.
0.0	0.270025704014	And -- and -- and the last piece of this, Maria, is this.
0.0	0.270042249172	And as president, I will rebuild the military and keep this country safe.
1.0	0.270247274951	We stuck to the fact that Americans are tired of Washington corporate interests and Democrats who are interested in just politics and power and they're looking for someone who's going to fight for them; looking for someone who's going to grow manufacturing sector of our economy, so those 74 percent of Americans who don't have a college degree have a chance to rise again.
0.0	0.270385215623	Let me tell you, if we don't get this election right, there may be no turning back for America.
0.0	0.270786575216	I'm going to go to the commanders and say give me a plan to win.
0.0	0.270791025473	We're going to end up in the same place.
0.0	0.270884490421	I'm against anything that's bad for my mother.
0.0	0.270989659312	That's why I ask for your support for president.
0.0	0.271454714113	We had Hezbollah.
0.0	0.271477904358	Right.
0.0	0.271477904358	Right.
0.0	0.271477904358	Right.
0.0	0.271477904358	Right.
0.0	0.271477904358	Right.
0.0	0.271693521675	We haven't done so.
0.0	0.271729364821	We're going to let people in, but they're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.272278441779	Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.272354970784	That's what they're doing.
0.0	0.272546990915	Can we stop?
0.0	0.272750654403	Look, here's the deal, in this particular case, the FBI made a mistake.
0.0	0.272798885575	The talk has got to stop, the action has got to begin.
0.0	0.273102687508	Well, a couple of things.
0.0	0.273213374626	The time to turn the page is now.
0.0	0.273248776717	Well, I am going to answer your question, Neil.
0.0	0.273481511279	We will work with our Sunni allies.
0.0	0.273492678811	And nobody, nobody on either one of these stages has done more than I've done and the people of the State of Texas to deal with securing that border.
0.0	0.273593885229	I think what we need is a commander in chief who is focused like a laser on keeping this country safe and on defeating radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.273646927985	I think that would have been right, as well.
0.0	0.273918821643	You know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money.
0.0	0.274018775616	And sending that signal makes it impossible for us to be serious about taking out ISIS and restoring democracy in Syria.
0.0	0.274442281513	Not my kind of guy.
0.0	0.274452414011	I just want to thank all my colleagues here for being civil, and not falling for the traps.
0.0	0.274459605532	In my family, my dad fled oppression in Cuba to come to America.
0.0	0.274650964716	But I'm going to tell you the truth.
0.0	0.27481280867	This stuff is fantasy.
0.0	0.275051121383	You can call it visas, you can call it work permits, you can call it anything you want.
0.0	0.275053242759	This is one of the great tragedies in our country today.
0.0	0.27528604501	Let me say first that it is disturbing that every time one of these home-grown terrorist attacks occurs, and, as your question points out, they are occurring with far too great frequency, it turns out we had warning signals.
0.0	0.275542395761	Let's start with immigration and have a little bit of clarity.
0.0	0.275566556902	When I'm president, we're going to have a president that acts like it.
0.0	0.275598544614	I can tell you, there wouldn't have been much damage.
0.0	0.275691995077	The entire system of legal immigration must now be reexamined for security first and foremost, with an eye on ISIS.
0.0	0.275817671435	This is the unholy alliance that people need to know about between right and left.
0.0	0.275956853243	We need to stop that.
1.0	0.275994686835	But I will -- but I will tell you this, the socialist says they're going to pay for everything and give you everything for free, except they don't say they're going to raise it through taxes to 90 percent to do it.
0.0	0.276214277855	This is a remarkable and horrifying fact.
0.0	0.276275862082	Maybe you haven't.
0.0	0.276416468672	But I have no argument with anyone making up her mind about who to support.
0.0	0.276451985249	is exactly the leadership we need in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.276544862566	I do not see -- want to see one parent or loved one worrying about getting a call in the middle of the night.
0.0	0.276725080838	I am the man who can bring us together to do that, and I ask for your vote.
0.0	0.276935347445	We will arm and train the Kurds.
0.0	0.277045560952	And Mr. Trump is very focused...
0.0	0.277114043735	You know, in our country, there are a lot of people who feel as though they just don't have the power.
0.0	0.277235393139	The simple fact is one of the ways, Maria, to solve the problem you described is narrow the number of people coming by family petitioning to what every other country has so that we have the best and the brightest that come to our country.
0.0	0.277336388963	But I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost.
0.0	0.277422319823	I didn't find it offensive at all.
0.0	0.277422832159	What I said was that I think that Dr. Carson's ideas are good ideas.
0.0	0.27750389299	That's a dictatorship.
0.0	0.277594372013	You know, after 9/11, one of the efforts that we did in New York was if you see something or hear something suspicious, report it.
0.0	0.277602239962	Wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.277908799049	That's what he is.
0.0	0.278185185359	That is the thing that obviously makes sense, we can do that.
0.0	0.278186034896	First of all, yes, we've stolen.
0.0	0.278291585333	Well, let's just -- let's just follow up on this, because, you know, I've made it very clear that no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail, and because of Dodd-Frank, we now have in law a process that the president, the Federal Reserve, and others can use if any bank poses a systemic risk.
0.0	0.278315548051	We need all of them to be part of exactly what the first George Bush put together in the first Gulf War.
0.0	0.278413622471	And just to finish, people say, how will you get Mexico to pay?
0.0	0.278681097928	Then you have to get rid of Larry Kudlow, who sits on your panel, who's a great guy, who came out the other day and said, I love Trump's tax plan.
0.0	0.278687066223	You can have him.
0.0	0.278821129048	Say again?
0.0	0.279020959836	So I not only had the opportunity to go through the Cold War struggles in Central America, and even after 9/11 to be involved.
0.0	0.279276840468	They are -- they're in a position where they're smothering people.
0.0	0.279421139224	I can agree with you or not, but you can't have a question over your head.
0.0	0.27964495122	We have to find out -- many people knew about what was going on.
0.0	0.279689368493	So when somebody like Donald Trump and others...
0.0	0.279711553181	I have many friends that deal with China.
0.0	0.279921778638	You have got to pick somebody who has experience, somebody that has the know-how, the discipline.
0.0	0.279927064158	This is about people's lives, and we should level with the American people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare.
0.0	0.279985108656	The agreement on humanitarian relief now needs to be implemented, because there are enclaves that are literally filled with starving people throughout Syria.
1.0	0.280051381737	It's not theirs anymore.
0.0	0.280078621462	We've got to stop this culture of government dependence.
0.0	0.280091804633	I would like to start with a basic.
0.0	0.280177753263	That sounds like a long time ago.
0.0	0.280438638991	And if you elect me president, we will bring incredible growth back to this country.
0.0	0.280467219468	Maria, let me clear something up here.
0.0	0.280570223986	We got rid of Gadhafi.
0.0	0.280625464591	That the Ayatollah is a radical jihadist who really means it when he chants, "Death to America, death to Israel."
0.0	0.280705417774	That will change everything.
0.0	0.280719564502	With all the candidates, why me?
0.0	0.280755061878	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.280905838673	That's the difference.
0.0	0.280909940752	Here's the bottom line, and I'll close with this.
0.0	0.280962195839	We're not -- the American people -- forget about anything else, they've already been lied to and stolen from.
0.0	0.281014002117	We'll just clean it up.
0.0	0.28121275107	And, let me now on Social Security because we were getting into a good substantive exchange, and I want to say I think both Chris, and Mike are right.
0.0	0.281507867945	What's crony capitalism?
0.0	0.281589401262	And we got to fight like crazy so people can think the American dream still exists, because it does, with rising wages, with full employment and with everybody in America -- and I mean everybody in America -- having an opportunity to realize the American dream of having a better life than their mother and their father.
0.0	0.281771242813	Well, there is no question that some people go overboard when it comes to trying to make profits, and they don't take into consideration the American people.
0.0	0.281893372754	So I think the better approach, the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against China economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage Barack Obama is doing to this economy.
0.0	0.28211101827	The fact is, the reason why...
0.0	0.282166340077	Listen, in any Republican primary, everyone is going to say they support the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.282250756907	Just a little bit.
0.0	0.282646653928	So I'm going to keep making that case.
0.0	0.282704880123	I was a banker and I was proud of it.
0.0	0.282920813994	I want to talk to the folks at home.
0.0	0.282935954786	You know, I know to a lot of people in the media, this is just a great big game, and we're the players.
0.0	0.283156472381	And I have a road map and a plan right now to get us to balance.
0.0	0.283305813444	...before I go.
0.0	0.283649346266	Here's the way you need to deal with it.
0.0	0.283658030033	You know, I have two sons.
0.0	0.283879800167	She was a great CEO.
0.0	0.283891662417	ON the other side, you have so many Republicans, and what do they care about?
0.0	0.283956425513	Well, first let me address the tax issue because it's related to the entitlement issue and I want to thank you for holding a substantive debates where we can have debates about these key issues on taxes.
0.0	0.284026124465	They're going to end up in the productive economy, which is where we want them.
0.0	0.284248351593	You know, I want to go back for a moment to what we were just talking about.
0.0	0.284307350615	You see what the Saudi's -- deliver them a strong message but at the end of the day we have to keep our cool because most of the time they're going right with us.
0.0	0.28472653972	Well, there is no evidence that they can fix anything in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.284922565919	Well, I'm very happy to get a question this early on.
0.0	0.285142533349	Somebody who, yes, votes right, but much more than that, leads the efforts to protect the hard-fought gains that women have made, that, make no mistake about it, are under tremendous attack, not just by the Republican presidential candidates but by a whole national effort to try to set back women's rights.
0.0	0.285222633479	Well, let me just -- let me just say, once again...
0.0	0.285256974063	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.285256974063	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
1.0	0.285262290639	Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan.
0.0	0.285287902043	OK, good.
0.0	0.285421711442	I believe that we need to cut these taxes down, we need to be on a roadmap to balancing the budget, and we need to send power, money, and influence, the welfare department, the education department, job training, infrastructure, Medicaid, all of that out of Washington back to the states so we can run these programs from where we live to the top, not a one size fits all mentality that they have in Washington.
0.0	0.285499726746	And as far as the Syrians are concerned, Al-Hasakah province, perfect place.
0.0	0.285525474044	And I think the reason he did is because immigration is sort of an example of what's broken and what's wrong in Washington, D..C.
0.0	0.285534283474	I'm prepared.
0.0	0.285551391672	We are not France.
0.0	0.285577088796	That's a serious issue that we could work on.
0.0	0.285580173308	He has got -- that is why he is on the end.
0.0	0.285627799969	Maria, I'd like to interrupt this debate on the floor of the Senate to actually answer the question you asked, which was on entitlements.
0.0	0.285644323022	Today, I'm 60, I'm not married, I don't have any kids.
0.0	0.285824162616	If that's a blind trust, I don't know.
0.0	0.285934902083	And, here's the difference between me and Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.285939022215	If I could just respond.
0.0	0.286046159723	This is a humanitarian catastrophe.
0.0	0.28606580805	They're sick of politics as usual.
0.0	0.286191036551	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.286191036551	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.286191036551	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.286192937991	What we know is we're living longer.
0.0	0.286215841048	They will -- some will follow.
0.0	0.286281050949	Let me say on that...
0.0	0.286561691426	I will do so in a way that will bring people together.
0.0	0.286688958731	That is important.
0.0	0.286968243882	So, let's not in anyway imply here that either President Obama or myself, would in anyway not take on any vested interested, whether it's Wall Street, or drug companies, or insurance companies, or frankly, the gun lobby to stand up to do what's best for the American people.
0.0	0.287044892388	And you know what?
0.0	0.287044892388	And you know what?
0.0	0.287044892388	And you know what?
0.0	0.287044892388	And you know what?
0.0	0.287044892388	And you know what?
0.0	0.287044892388	And you know what?
0.0	0.287044892388	But you know what?
0.0	0.287112034676	(LAUGHTER) And he got nasty.
0.0	0.287137532534	I would put it in a blind trust.
0.0	0.287419813426	I can't speak for the Koch Brothers, you're referring to a Super PAC that we don't coordinate with, that was set up to support President Obama, that has now decided that they want to support me.
0.0	0.287468485695	Target the efforts for people that are committing crimes with guns, and if you do that, and get it right, you're going to be much better off than creating a political argument where there's a big divide.
0.0	0.287535429474	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.287566379177	But let me also tell you, one of the issues has got to be the integration of both community and police.
0.0	0.287837167597	You know, I find it really quite fascinating some of the president's proclamations.
0.0	0.288164756276	We need to bring people together in Washington.
0.0	0.288297369438	Too often, they give up, they negotiate with themselves.
0.0	0.288387215729	You also have to prove that you're going to pay these people more than you would pay someone else, so that you're not undercutting it by bringing in cheap labor.
0.0	0.288525914745	And remember, the Russians have not gone after ISIS or any of the other terrorist groups.
0.0	0.288732544886	But let me go back to something that's very important.
0.0	0.288745541009	I'm never going to change my tune.
0.0	0.288759362216	You're right.
0.0	0.288759362216	You're right.
0.0	0.288856214335	How about this?
0.0	0.289079118132	And I said, "well, if he wanted to play a song, maybe he could play, 'New York, New York'?"
0.0	0.2891026123	It's the evil government that is -- that is putting all these regulations on us so that we can't survive.
0.0	0.289312858054	And he got nasty.
0.0	0.289382031153	don't listen to the Trumps of the world and allowing them to divide us.
0.0	0.289411806407	We could do a whole show on that.
0.0	0.289709964034	Guaranteeing that women's work finally gets the pay, the equal pay that we deserve.
0.0	0.28973305278	I choose him as my vice presidential candidate, and the Democrats sue because we can't take him along for the ride.
0.0	0.289833410164	And you better get rid of them because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.289942023204	I like Chris Christie, but we can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports Common Core.
0.0	0.289994942914	You get the Senate.
0.0	0.290020728927	And it has been a remarkable situation in our state.
0.0	0.290109164881	The millionaires and billionaires are doing great under Obama.
0.0	0.290142149458	Much of the discussion is centered over whether or not the different tax plans help, or affect the middle class.
0.0	0.290168489338	We're running.
0.0	0.29018066838	Are you fed up with how Washington wastes your money?
0.0	0.29018409428	So as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and the like.
0.0	0.290616288728	We have to eliminate the sequester, rebuild our military in a way that makes it clear that we're back in the game.
0.0	0.290626098419	Bipartisan issue.
0.0	0.290857709588	Yeah, they are unhinged.
0.0	0.290876785717	There are lids on people's aspirations.
0.0	0.290885312673	We also want to dominate this from a commercial side.
0.0	0.29105256679	And when we talk about Wall Street, let's talk about Wall Street.
0.0	0.291147168427	Well, I mean right here.
0.0	0.291172212057	They don't like NBC, but I like the poll.
0.0	0.291224736917	And I think Ted Kennedy had a very clear idea about what needed to be done.
0.0	0.291244036254	It has to be dealt with.
0.0	0.291389787008	Nobody can solve it like me.
0.0	0.291448804223	I'm just saying.
0.0	0.291656571502	Carl, are we really talking about getting government involved in fantasy football?
0.0	0.292063113687	Yes, I'm going to do away with that.
0.0	0.292069522025	Oh, well, you know, it just didn't work out for you.
0.0	0.292081839573	She wants to continue down the path of Iran, Benghazi, the Russian reset, Dodd-Frank, all the things that have -- that have gone wrong in this country, she would be a national security mess.
0.0	0.292147913549	I have...
0.0	0.292370432504	And when FDR said, "Yeah, it is," that we're going to use all of the resources that we have to create jobs, to build homes, to feed people, to protect the farmers, we are a nation which if we come together there is nothing that we could not accomplish.
0.0	0.292371671466	If there's an act of violence in America, his immediate answer before he even knows the facts is gun control.
0.0	0.29237615223	But Iran is at the heart of most of the evil that is going on in the Middle East through their proxies.
0.0	0.292410975507	Sometimes you win a war by killing murderous, evil terrorists.
0.0	0.292428756107	It'll be a pretty busy day, but that Iran negotiation is going to be torn up on day one.
0.0	0.292591354552	There's only a promise to pay by the next generation, and the next generation's not big enough to pay it.
0.0	0.292612353283	I just don't believe that this country's days are going to be deeply -- you know, going down.
0.0	0.292620707032	But I would add this.
0.0	0.292880065887	And that is wrong.
0.0	0.292891917636	I'm too trusting.
0.0	0.293045334662	And if we capture any of them alive, they are getting a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know.
0.0	0.293159302496	That is absolutely not right.
0.0	0.293271457932	If you'll answer the (inaudible) core question.
0.0	0.293273587191	I've heard them talk about deporting 10 or 11 -- people here from this country out of this country, splitting families.
0.0	0.293347429375	Suicide, alcoholism, drugs, that's why we need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country, and not just a handful of billionaires who have enormous economic and political power.
0.0	0.293642357192	Governor Huckabee's exactly right, we need to honor the promises made to our seniors, but for younger workers -- look.
1.0	0.293705470943	That's exactly what the Republican establishment says too.
0.0	0.293772820049	Don't vote for me if you want to keep the gridlock in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.293988574139	But the final thing I want to say about this is the following.
0.0	0.294168614939	And it's something that can be done, and I get questioned about that.
0.0	0.294185269357	And for the sake of me, I can't figure out which one is which.
0.0	0.294192116091	My name was mentioned.
0.0	0.29427469568	Let me just -- just say this.
0.0	0.294553710882	This is a bad deal.
0.0	0.294674129723	It works very, very well.
0.0	0.294770253008	Well, I'm just not sure I agree completely with that assessment.
0.0	0.294907283463	And when America does not lead, the world is a dangerous and a tragic place.
0.0	0.295005576264	I can.
0.0	0.295012581474	Or that we're just going to be great?
0.0	0.295127979179	Well, this is what I would say.
0.0	0.29516184029	And -- and -- you know, it goes back to the whole concept of regulations, which are in everything.
0.0	0.295167223557	I've created tens of thousands of jobs, and in all due respect -- and actually some of these folks I really like a lot -- but I'm the only one that can say that.
0.0	0.295336147599	It's never been that way in American politics before.
0.0	0.295450181418	Well, the deal was done.
0.0	0.295694576412	Well, if the law would change, yeah.
0.0	0.295921047707	I think the times are much more serious.
0.0	0.296348034229	And I feel very strongly that I have an agenda, I have a record that really does respond to a lot of the specific needs that the women in our country face.
0.0	0.296569571014	If a soldier has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.296681761227	But, the real issue, I think, that the Senator is injecting into this is that if you had a Super PAC, like President Obama has, which now says it wants to support me.
0.0	0.296857407571	It's the only way to level the playing field between big and powerful and small and powerless.
0.0	0.296911255259	That will be my mission as president.
0.0	0.296996170168	Well, gee, after the last debate, I was told that I didn't smile enough.
0.0	0.297293776337	Look, the -- the deal is already done.
0.0	0.297373913242	I understand both of these issues, how to build the economy and doing that as a governor who'd built jobs, had cut taxes and also a governor who understands foreign-policy, and that's why I entered this race.
0.0	0.297607790455	If you looking at what happened with Boeing and if you look at what happened with so many companies that deal -- so we don't have an equal playing field.
0.0	0.297652301384	Secondly, a policy on recruiting and hiring, and then more resources for -- for training.
0.0	0.297743321635	But, what we did is we said to the working families of this country, look, we know things are tough, but if you want to help us go beyond establishment politics, and establishment economics, send us something.
0.0	0.297793850442	These mythical Arab armies that my friends talk about that are going to protect us don't exist.
0.0	0.297833399158	I will be the Ronald Reagan if I can find a Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.297899523769	It ain't going to happen.
0.0	0.297923126063	Again...
0.0	0.297923126063	So...
0.0	0.298041665576	It is.
0.0	0.298042044036	And this is what we have to -- I -- I've got to tell you, when wages don't rise -- and they haven't for a lot of families for a number of years -- it's very, very difficult for them.
0.0	0.298070536937	I'd say, "General, enforce the law against everyone justly, fairly, and aggressively.
0.0	0.29837875394	We need somebody who can balance budgets, cut taxes...
0.0	0.298787227283	But you ought to acknowledge the government doesn't do a very good job at it.
0.0	0.298822277537	I think President Obama has set a great example.
0.0	0.298841976561	They don't want them made here.
0.0	0.299032354664	The natural next question is who actually has done so.
0.0	0.299157466076	You know, I think my biggest weakness is exactly the opposite.
0.0	0.299216688657	And, you look at the questions -- "Donald Trump, are you a comic-book villain?"
0.0	0.299263983853	Well, I'll tell you something: you can take everything from the top 1 percent, and you apply it to our fiscal gap, and you won't even make a dent in it.
0.0	0.29953462596	Nobody -- I could stand up here all night.
0.0	0.299590672418	Take it from your professors...
0.0	0.299753251745	And yes, it was a very difficult time.
0.0	0.299862649867	We have to be honest about it.
0.0	0.300013446737	When I'm president of the United States, we are going to win this war on ISIS.
0.0	0.300186773318	ISIS came in, and now occupies significant territory in Libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold.
0.0	0.3003047136	And Lehman Brothers started it all.
0.0	0.300445065445	I can do that.
0.0	0.300470978254	What you saw was a parade of, "I'll give you this for free; I'll give you that for free."
0.0	0.300513497335	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the Constitution.
0.0	0.30052766831	You want to fix Medicare?
0.0	0.300698984333	That's a blessing.
0.0	0.300825493955	Came out great.
0.0	0.30091264985	Becky --
0.0	0.300951852178	A person who, in fact, has a long experience in foreign-policy issues, which is different from many of the other governors and prospective governors who are running.
0.0	0.300962512683	But in 2015, we have a very different economy.
0.0	0.301053128725	First, rather than expand benefits for everyone, I do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs.
0.0	0.301665130661	I do.
0.0	0.301665130661	I have.
0.0	0.301665130661	We do.
0.0	0.301665130661	You do.
0.0	0.301707306707	It will be a way of life.
0.0	0.301724501434	You don't have to.
0.0	0.301921878183	That's right.
0.0	0.301972684475	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.301972684475	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.302195596271	That is not right.
0.0	0.302195596271	That's not right.
0.0	0.302195596271	That's not right.
0.0	0.302294097764	I have studied that issue in great detail.
0.0	0.302388751759	Let's talk about our campaigns.
0.0	0.302547286758	Now, on that tariff -- here's what I'm saying, China -- they send their goods and we don't tax it -- they do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.302591241818	But I want to start by helping those people who are most at risk, the ones who, yes, are cutting their pills in half, who don't believe they can make the rent, who are worried about what comes next for them.
0.0	0.302683722197	We need fundamental police reform, clearly, clearly, when we talk about a criminal justice system.
0.0	0.302812926174	The fact that it's happened for so many people here throughout our history, that's what makes us special.
0.0	0.302858439735	All right, look, this has been a great debate.
0.0	0.30316914635	The Syrians should stay in Syria.
0.0	0.303321641434	You know, as I said already twice in this debate, we have a very serious problem in this country.
0.0	0.303327633547	And, that's why tonight I'm asking you for your vote.
0.0	0.303620832684	So I have nothing at all critical of him.
0.0	0.30363596669	And people said "you can't win, you can't change the culture."
0.0	0.303804941786	And I make a lot more than the average American.
0.0	0.303829216245	In other words, the very rich are getting richer, almost everybody is going -- getting poorer.
0.0	0.303930992339	We're going to have people come in, but they're coming in legally.
0.0	0.3040185161	We're not going to solve this problem with traditional politics.
0.0	0.304145732162	I think there is constitutional and legal authority for the president to have done what he did.
0.0	0.304233853111	And I'm going to tell you, that it -- I'm going to suggest to you here tonight, that you can't do on the job training.
0.0	0.304455386083	I'm very proud that NARAL endorsed me because when it comes to it we need a leader on women's issues.
0.0	0.304772545289	But they can't get along.
0.0	0.304897643045	Well, you know what I'm worried about?
0.0	0.305225977566	I can govern by bringing people together.
0.0	0.305258176976	It will be a long day.
0.0	0.305391150027	Do senators have the right to disagree with the president?
0.0	0.305424894721	We'll go to the Congress.
0.0	0.305457766456	Well, it's interesting.
0.0	0.305474327426	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.3055503369	Well, with respect to Syria, I really do appreciate the efforts that Secretary Kerry has made.
0.0	0.305562218708	That's who's in my mind
0.0	0.305587695634	And, we have a government and leaders in government that are completely out of touch, and that's why I'm running for president.
0.0	0.305599188754	I mean, you have great constitutional lawyers that say you can't run.
0.0	0.305692609081	Now, the fact is, what this president has done is invited Russia to play an even bigger role, bring in Vladimir Putin to negotiate getting those chemical weapons back from Assad, yet what do we have today?
0.0	0.305789855642	Absolutely.
0.0	0.305789855642	Absolutely.
0.0	0.305864938989	So look, corporations ought to exercise some responsibility.
0.0	0.305962700681	China, they don't like to tell us but they have total control -- just about, of North Korea.
0.0	0.306164815188	And as president I would expand enormous energy, literally call every member of Congress that I thought I could persuade.
0.0	0.306293284705	It could be people that are going to do great, great destruction.
0.0	0.306355012926	And I would not stand for that as president of the United States.
0.0	0.30641929971	Well, I respectfully disagree.
0.0	0.306455649786	Where the secretary and I have a very profound difference, in the last debate -- and I believe in her book -- very good book, by the way -- in her book and in this last debate, she talked about getting the approval or the support or the mentoring of Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.306532451136	We have to support the fighters on the ground, principally the Arabs and the Kurds who are willing to stand up and take territory back from Raqqa to Ramadi.
1.0	0.306578317561	Believe me, that is why Ohio is doing well.
0.0	0.306689937063	I have proposed there be a Middle East NATO so that we can combine our allies there to stand up to Iranian expansion, and at the same time join together to begin to stop and this ISIL thing before it becomes an actual state.
0.0	0.306876519499	John, I'd like to address this?
0.0	0.307035448791	When you head back to airport tonight, go check and see what the...
0.0	0.307047233967	Probably, I don't know -- you people write the stuff.
0.0	0.307382657555	Everybody just needs to get used to it.
0.0	0.307608474171	But I think a pause on Syrian refugees has been exactly right for all the governors that have called for it, and also, of course, for me as the governor of Ohio.
0.0	0.307613559542	I am, but people are upset, and they're upset for a reason about the future of this country.
0.0	0.307730973069	Donald, Donald -- can I -- I hope you reconsider this, because this policy is a policy that makes it impossible to build the coalition necessary to take out ISIS.
0.0	0.307747259038	So you know what?
0.0	0.30781463092	I got the briefings.
0.0	0.30786108535	Without China, North Korea doesn't even eat.
0.0	0.308014058406	So you might not.
0.0	0.308025067041	Folks, we've got to wake up.
0.0	0.308055837634	It's very important we focus on the threats we face today, and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in.
0.0	0.308224428082	But to destroy ISIS, it is necessary.
0.0	0.308328359205	The president wants to do things without working with his Congress, without working with the legislature, and without getting the consent of the American people.
0.0	0.308603212879	And it's not too much to ask of our generation after everything our parents and our grandparents did for us.
0.0	0.308731198901	I think we should be for free trade but I think fair trade.
0.0	0.308757306823	So that is not by any stretch a pie in the sky.
0.0	0.308793870432	I know personally how extraordinary and unique this nation is.
0.0	0.3088070014	That's why I'm running for office because when I become president of the United States, on my first day in office we are going to repeal every single one of his unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.308873454509	There is a bill sitting in the House that would actually pass and have us go to zero-based budgeting so we know where every dime of your money is being spent instead of only talking about how much more we're going to spend year after year after year.
0.0	0.308979545804	The more the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected are advantaged.
0.0	0.309068677788	What happened with Atlantic City is very, very disgraceful.
0.0	0.309249523572	We have Dodd-Frank.
0.0	0.309379212905	It appears that the same someone who has been whispering in old Marco's ear too.
0.0	0.309556026824	My point is this.
0.0	0.309648766783	You ought to just be able to get over it, get used to it...
0.0	0.309717607729	In the same light, as the foreign leader, Winston Churchill's politics were not my politics.
0.0	0.309793619231	And what I have concluded is that the best policy is to get rid of all government subsidies, and get the government out of our lives, and let people rise and fall based on how good they are.
0.0	0.310007737288	That's good.
0.0	0.310032417646	That is...
0.0	0.3100654699	And I do carry on occasion, sometimes a lot.
0.0	0.310186880925	And I'm very grateful to the brave Navy SEALs who carried out that mission.
0.0	0.310329242401	I promise.
0.0	0.310447580165	I'd consider it.
0.0	0.310719061609	This is extraordinary.
0.0	0.310745045718	When you became president, you had a Democratic Congress and a filibuster-proof Democratic Senate.
0.0	0.310761029041	It is time for Republicans in D.C. to fight.
0.0	0.311058548012	We're going dark when it comes to detecting the next attack.
0.0	0.311345793158	So you don't get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.311659669687	Now, let me just be clear, John.
0.0	0.311904567522	I would choose Nelson Mandela for his generosity of heart, his understanding of the need for reconciliation.
0.0	0.311922165715	And I think this has become something that needs to be looked at in terms of regulation.
0.0	0.312142731669	If somebody's already stolen money from you, are you going to give them more?
0.0	0.312217038825	Are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the Assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire?
0.0	0.312401703875	And I said, "Didn't you resent America for not letting you be with your father in those formative and very threatening years?"
0.0	0.312446331475	You can campaign, or just resign and let someone else take the job.
0.0	0.312574378201	Why don't you wait in line?
0.0	0.312597006976	But the ideal scenario is to train Americans to do the work so we don't have to rely on people from abroad.
0.0	0.312732707324	If we -- if we don't act now, we are going to be the first generation in American history that leaves our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.312810499548	And I give you my word, if I am elected president, no service man or service woman will be forced to be on their knees, and any nation that captures our fighting men will feel the full force and fury of the United States of America.
0.0	0.313093349356	It's good to be with you.
0.0	0.313448064774	We haven't.
0.0	0.3136242203	So I have voiced criticisms.
0.0	0.313677542753	They're looking -- they're recruiting people that enter this country as doctors and engineers and even fiances.
0.0	0.313705539197	Every election we talk about this.
0.0	0.313813397349	When people ask me, whose fault is it?
0.0	0.313850177553	And recognizing that it's so important, this election, because we're talking about America for the people versus America for the government.
0.0	0.313859639516	It's got great people, it's got loving people, wonderful people.
0.0	0.314016294169	But bottom line is: The president is right.
0.0	0.314300955162	If we don't stop them over there, they are coming here just as sure as I stand here in front of you.
0.0	0.314969568205	I think, though, government is too big now.
0.0	0.315053572812	My dad was a bartender, my mother was a maid.
0.0	0.315638642653	Ever.
0.0	0.315639907078	I think we're on the verge of the greatest time, and I want to fix the things to let people rise up.
0.0	0.315728037339	Nobody can deny them.
0.0	0.315751661346	We need leadership, someone who has a backbone and sticks with things, rather than just talks about them as though anything matters when you're talking about amendments that don't even actually are part of a bill that ever passed.
0.0	0.315788016094	This will end.
0.0	0.31601201527	But what is to prevent a future liberal president or a liberal Congress from coming back and not just raising the income tax, but also raising that VAT tax, and that vat tax is really bad for seniors.
0.0	0.316133100196	Our country doesn't win anymore.
0.0	0.316136357877	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.316136357877	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.316225640315	The Europeans have moved on.
0.0	0.316303921925	If we're willing to do what it takes now, the 21st century is going to be the new American century, greater than any other era we've had in the history of this great nation.
0.0	0.316418106748	This is about more than replacing a D with an R. We need a leader who will help us take our government back.
0.0	0.316616874367	Like rich kids, they deserve to get a free education.
0.0	0.316865595562	I am not a member of the political class.
0.0	0.316893251643	That is what I believe.
0.0	0.317036749813	Well, Neil, I'm glad we're focusing on the important topics of the evening.
0.0	0.317071082758	I hope Congress says no to this deal.
0.0	0.317123394338	I'm a fighter.
1.0	0.317171538396	He has called him a disappointment.
0.0	0.317177294867	These...
0.0	0.317273368741	President Obama and I are friends.
1.0	0.317394126583	And he says, the president's appointee, that crime is going up because of this.
0.0	0.317405040172	But let me say one more thing.
0.0	0.317556154694	When I'm president of the United States we are getting rid of Obamacare and we are rebuilding our military.
0.0	0.317567056225	And I will assure you, as the governor of the state of Texas, and as those last four years have shown me, the preparation to be ready to stand on this stage and talk about those monetary policies, those domestic policies, and those foreign policies, Americans are going to see that I am ready to be that individual.
0.0	0.317815177487	As far as Mark is concerned, as far as the visas are concerned, if we need people, they have -- it's fine.
0.0	0.31806011932	When you're a governor, you're held accountable for everything you do.
0.0	0.318157179394	Let me just say this.
0.0	0.318271595124	And first of all, we've got to recognize that there is problem that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have caused.
0.0	0.318394414486	But I guess I'm supposed to come out great.
0.0	0.318809156758	She was right.
0.0	0.31881704744	They recognize that people's actions don't always match their words.
0.0	0.318943365577	I will show you what they do to women.
0.0	0.319061389499	If I'm president of the United States and Congress tries to cut the military, I will veto that in a millisecond.
0.0	0.319102044949	You want to see a war on women?
0.0	0.31922900008	We need to be focusing on what fixes this country.
0.0	0.319243920158	It's the same thing that I did in Ohio.
0.0	0.319722156872	The fact is in New Jersey, what we have done is to make it easier now to get a conceal and carry permit.
0.0	0.319929077609	As president of the United States, I will be a commander in chief that will have the back of the military.
0.0	0.319974693524	First and foremost, this issue has to be now more than anything else about keeping America safe.
0.0	0.320076915665	And where we are right now is we have got to stand up to the Trumps of the world who are trying to divide us up.
0.0	0.320320428091	I said right from the beginning that we should take no Syrian refugees of any kind.
0.0	0.320332261427	How are we going to do this?
0.0	0.320383690968	We need to get back in the game as it relates to our Arab nations.
0.0	0.320420396696	We should be deporting criminals, not hardworking immigrant families who do the very best they can and often are keeping economies going in many places in our country.
0.0	0.32044752439	And second, the First Amendment Defense Act, which is protecting religious liberty, if it's not passed by then, which I suspect it won't, because the president will veto it, I will institute an executive order to make sure that people of faith are not being -- not being harassed and persecuted by the federal government for standing up for the religious beliefs.
0.0	0.320584820881	I know for a fact how difficult it is to raise children, how expensive it's become for working families.
0.0	0.320962789418	They should be running all the time, then they won't have time to plan attacks against us.
0.0	0.321002876558	I hope the Supreme Court upholds them.
0.0	0.321018493912	They're tough, they're strong, they're great people.
0.0	0.321132973185	I think Americans want someone to have a track record of showing them how to get this country back on record, someone who will stand up and every day project that best days of America are in front of us.
0.0	0.3212145825	The problem is we never get it done.
0.0	0.321282523633	Our next president, and our Republican nominee can not be someone who supports those positions.
0.0	0.32142058131	And clearly, what we need to do is get a group of experts together, including people from other countries, some of our friends from Israel, who have had experience screening these people and come up with new guidelines for immigration, and for visas, for people who are coming into this country.
0.0	0.321469686448	Let me conclude by just saying this.
0.0	0.321751959808	Why didn't they call?
0.0	0.321754417233	Where I see the weakness is in those three people that are left on the Democratic stage.
0.0	0.321809087534	I want to take care of women.
0.0	0.321865802245	But I agree with Jeb, you can't just do this by growing the economy.
0.0	0.321880440103	...and be held accountable.
0.0	0.321889139257	But the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with Iran, maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world, yes, that is something I want to achieve.
0.0	0.322201915544	I hope you will make a decision soon on this.
0.0	0.322228828098	You can't send your troops into harm's way unless you give them every opportunity to be successful.
0.0	0.322264624247	A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to go on a congressional delegation.
0.0	0.322836669817	No accomplishment.
0.0	0.323022017483	I think that is the real key here.
0.0	0.3230653537	I applaud Secretary Kerry and the president for trying to put together this agreement.
0.0	0.323066091722	I don't think anybody should expand Medicaid.
0.0	0.32307276089	Let me say, I read that editorial today with a great amusement.
0.0	0.32339993754	I don't think you expand entitlements when so many people are dependent on government and when the money the federal government is offering is going to be taken away from you after just a couple of years.
0.0	0.323452755422	And the fact of the matter is if we give them a mission and we don't tie their hands behind their back, they can get it accomplished.
0.0	0.323482267487	It's not that complicated actually.
0.0	0.323542835289	They're off to China.
0.0	0.32357351512	We can do that in Washington.
0.0	0.323684431056	If this all works out, I'm happy to consider naming you as V.P.
0.0	0.323758372477	Well, I've been --
0.0	0.324232448058	I stood on the stage and watched Marco in rather indignantly, look at Governor Bush and say, someone told you that because we're running for the same office, that criticizing me will get you to that office.
0.0	0.324238278299	Sometimes it's a complicated situation, but some things are black and white.
0.0	0.324380560335	It isn't "I put money in, I'm getting it back."
0.0	0.324439623593	And for good cause.
0.0	0.324619779293	Come with me to Iraq and Afghanistan, folks.
0.0	0.324704207646	So, are we going to ban Muslims from India, from Indonesia, from countries that are strong allies -- that we need to build better relationships with?
0.0	0.324763078701	We don't need Hillary Clinton's price controls for -- again, does anybody out there think that giving Washington, D.C., the opportunity to run the pharmaceutical industry is a good idea, given how well they have done running the government?
0.0	0.324837574285	We need to make the government run smarter and better, and reform this corporate tax system, bring that money back to the United States to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, and we need to use it also to protect our grid from terrorists.
0.0	0.325114773553	I'm deadly serious about doing this job the right way.
0.0	0.325276839669	The president doesn't understand -- and by the way, neither does Secretary Clinton -- and here's my warning to everybody out in the audience tonight.
0.0	0.325324881416	The Democrats' answer to everything is more government control over wages, and more empowering trial lawyers to file lawsuits.
0.0	0.325404566455	And that is what's so critical for our neighborhoods, our families, our children, and our grandchildren.
0.0	0.325421841657	I cannot tell you how much our nation is threatened and how we need a commander in chief who understands the threats to this nation.
0.0	0.325491310264	I think our country is tired of the politicians who simply read the polls and fail to lead.
0.0	0.325491462296	Why, for the life of me, I do not understand why did we stop doing vocational education in America, people that can work with their hands; people you can train to do this work while they're still in high school so they can graduate ready to go work.
0.0	0.325573481053	It was a back sacrifice, and I have to hand it to Ben.
0.0	0.32563525858	No.
0.0	0.32563525858	No.
0.0	0.32563525858	No.
0.0	0.32563525858	No.
0.0	0.32563525858	No.
0.0	0.32563525858	No.
0.0	0.32563525858	No.
0.0	0.32563525858	No.
0.0	0.325777001741	One thing I want to be clear about tonight.
0.0	0.325807782461	And, the fact is, none of them.
0.0	0.3258082367	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.3258082367	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.325842745062	A Republican Congress did that.
0.0	0.325978622909	But, we can't rest.
0.0	0.326198405318	And it creates a -- a contempt for the law, for the rule of law.
0.0	0.326460006374	Well, you know, I think, from a historical point of view, somebody with my background, somebody with my views, somebody who has spent his entire life taking on the big money interests, I think a Sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment, as well.
0.0	0.326808797953	You know, in recent travels around this country, I've encountered so many Americans who are discouraged and angry as they watch our freedom, our security and the American dream slipping away under an unresponsive government that is populated by bureaucrats and special interest groups.
0.0	0.326891029635	We're on the verge of being the first generation of Americans that leave our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.327010022552	I believe I can get the money that I need by taxing the wealthy, by closing loopholes, the things that we are way overdue for doing.
0.0	0.3271156798	That's just a fact, and that's what Donald Trump taps into.
0.0	0.327258747808	And we finally need to tackle the basics to cut this government down to size and hold it accountable.
0.0	0.327259073604	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.327375542777	That is not consistent conservatism, that is political calculation.
0.0	0.327445507505	That's all I'm saying.
0.0	0.327515447016	And until we deal with the health of Americans and do what we did with polio -- when I was a little kid, we eradicated it.
0.0	0.327515911331	No their not.
0.0	0.327520242225	I want to go back for a second thought on this issue of income inequality.
0.0	0.328091795861	We need to get realistic about this.
0.0	0.328482673147	Those are the things we brought, and we were able to get things done.
0.0	0.328619991314	So I'm going to come up with the best way forward.
0.0	0.328814079349	We've got a president who cannot bring himself to say the words "radical Islamic terrorism."
0.0	0.329029167426	They are devaluing -- it's so impossible for -- you look at Caterpillar Tractor and what's happening with Caterpillar and Kamatsu (ph).
0.0	0.329168644669	And the reason -- and the reason...
0.0	0.329478345995	And I went to one of these Turkish refugee camps right on the border of Syria.
0.0	0.329601157721	They're never going to let it happen.
0.0	0.329635181524	I know that we are at greater risk today than at any time since then of another attack.
0.0	0.329719499124	It's fine if they come in, but they have to come in legally.
0.0	0.329845711004	You sit down and you work with people, you make demands of people, in this case demanding Iran stop the support of international terrorism.
0.0	0.329969129984	We have to go after terrorist networks, predominantly ISIS -- that's not the only one, but let's focus on that for a minute.
0.0	0.330063188717	No, he doesn't.
0.0	0.330145951507	Actually going to do something to help the American worker.
1.0	0.330225088893	That's wrong.
0.0	0.330295910097	You know, the Russians wanted to buy time.
0.0	0.330406809741	There are other racial discrepancies.
0.0	0.330457948992	I'll tell you what else people are concerned about.
0.0	0.33058690462	You've got to give people hope.
0.0	0.330845246279	No, absolutely not.
0.0	0.330866920123	Right there, right next to the plant.
0.0	0.331239057253	I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would.
0.0	0.331249623903	You see, you have one side, the Democrats, and with immigration, all they care about is votes.
0.0	0.331281550625	In my case, whether it's health care, or getting us to debt-free tuition, or moving us toward paid family leave, I have been very specific about where I would raise the money, how much it would cost, and how I would move this agenda forward.
0.0	0.331282666881	And I'll tell you what Hillary Clinton has said: Hillary Clinton says she agrees with the dissenters -- the Supreme Court dissenters in the Heller case.
0.0	0.331413984004	Every war you can imaging, we have people at each other's throat and our strength is actually in our unity.
0.0	0.331433115986	And the reasons why I've done is I don't believe we have a good process of being able to vet them.
0.0	0.331435128488	Last I heard, a United States senator had the right to disagree with the president, including a president who has done such an extraordinary job.
0.0	0.331484177605	And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word.
0.0	0.331719682399	But here's the real key.
0.0	0.331784399925	And, people are sick of believing that the government is never going to really address this.
0.0	0.331814653518	It's going to happen in this country, there are going to be further attacks.
0.0	0.331979198835	I think that's a major accomplishment.
0.0	0.332007664762	So there are people watching tonight in business.
0.0	0.332070377481	In this particular moment of serious crises, saying to the American people don't give up on the political process.
0.0	0.332071167603	I'd like to jump in.
0.0	0.332422999807	And let me say this also.
0.0	0.332545535718	The fact is, there's a number of things that the next president is going to have to do to clean up this mess.
0.0	0.332618379238	He was kind of a conservative guy in many respects.
0.0	0.33265372143	China is ripping us on trade.
0.0	0.332662198677	That's why I've entered this race, and I think I have the experience to do it.
0.0	0.332722609295	Everytime they got a paycheck, the government reached in and took something out of it before they ever saw it.
0.0	0.33286828262	What we are talking about in reality is a corrupt campaign finance system, that's what we're talking about.
0.0	0.332923177816	That's not the America that I've ever known.
0.0	0.333126009224	A politician other than the people in the states -- I don't want to -- a politician cannot get them to pay.
0.0	0.333160723506	I was invoked in that question, so let me just say -- in that answer -- let me say, the real question here, I hate to interrupt this episode of Court TV.
0.0	0.333360441272	So don't put people in there if you don't want them bombed.
0.0	0.333436512771	You're an American, as is everybody else on this stage, and I would suggest we focus on who's best prepared to be commander- in-chief, because that's the most important question facing the country.
0.0	0.333775874521	Well, that's a real question.
0.0	0.333793101179	I'm the only person on this stage who's done that and we will get it done as President of the United States.
0.0	0.334019806958	You really can't.
0.0	0.334345491938	And I was proud to stand with him and support it.
0.0	0.334421530642	If there was a -- and you know I'm not bringing a suit.
0.0	0.33461368945	No -- no...
0.0	0.334683574086	Maria -- Maria, what you were talking about just now is called corporate inversion.
0.0	0.334946089289	Progressives don't believe that.
0.0	0.334977152196	There are many lawyers.
0.0	0.335023030116	That has not been...
0.0	0.335084524581	No, not at all, absolutely not.
0.0	0.335160485254	I do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination to succeed President Obama.
0.0	0.335186475084	So I believe as president I will look very carefully about unintended consequences.
0.0	0.335217017192	Now, I'm the only person that's put out a detailed plan on how to deal with entitlements.
0.0	0.335227032161	Yes, our allies are not perfect.
0.0	0.335552494952	And it troubles me that people are rewarded for tearing down our country.
0.0	0.335625351765	And we're letting them get away with it and we can't let them get away with it.
1.0	0.335701768508	Nobody knows who Mossadegh was, democratically-elected prime minister of Iran.
0.0	0.335715279166	I'm going to get a response to that, Neil.
0.0	0.335917836737	But I feel that the gun-free zones and, you know, when you say that, that's target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill. That's target.
0.0	0.336181701072	I'm looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.336222092015	What we need now is a proven leader who has produced results.
0.0	0.336373097108	OK, just so you understand -- I know so much about trading about with China.
0.0	0.336695779662	Socialist and government dependent.
0.0	0.33693113843	And when the president of the United States gets out to speak about it, does he support police officers?
0.0	0.336960852459	We have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone.
0.0	0.337160608007	I will not take advice from Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.337209077517	This nation has been great to me, and that's the only way I know to pay you back.
0.0	0.337280840257	Why don't we just give a chicken in every pot, while we're, you know, coming up -- coming up with these fantasy tax schemes.
0.0	0.337325109518	-- work better to lift everyone up, men and women.
0.0	0.337667899287	Their kids are having a hard time finding any work at all.
0.0	0.337718168617	But this is nothing new.
0.0	0.337741534891	And to expand on Mr. Carson's -- or Dr. Carson's question, let's face it, we have laws already.
0.0	0.337749980304	-- fix America, this is the formula.
0.0	0.337995095877	But our goal is, in fact, to try over a period of time to, in fact, deal with our enemies, not just ignore that reality.
0.0	0.338173471293	We don't need to raise taxes to get this done.
0.0	0.338646379862	Let me tell you, Donald Trump would be a president every day of the week and twice on Sunday, rather than Hillary.
0.0	0.338871360118	And it is now being put into place everyplace across the state of Ohio.
0.0	0.338942032905	Who actually has stood up not just to Democrats, but to leaders in our own party?
0.0	0.338983460116	Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well.
0.0	0.339021121547	We have to provide the NATO support to back up the mission that is going on.
0.0	0.33909329354	You know the nice thing about the mainstream media, they don't hide their views.
0.0	0.339100140068	I'm worried about bankrupting the American people.
0.0	0.339340679244	I guess just for the fun of it; they want to throw money around.
0.0	0.339505011024	I have fought my entire life to make sure that healthcare is a right for all people.
0.0	0.33950904072	You get, like, three days where you have to show up?
0.0	0.339565569109	This is the fantasy...
0.0	0.339872757899	It was.
0.0	0.339872757899	You did.
0.0	0.339900520545	You know, we didn't start out four years ago at the top of the heap.
0.0	0.340049955888	And kind of -- that's what I see our campaign is about right now.
0.0	0.340148614639	The question always is, what works better, the private marketplace or government?
0.0	0.340254912517	He got lucky with fracking.
0.0	0.340322674628	I'm wearing a Trump tie tonight.
0.0	0.340358984539	You gotta be patient.
0.0	0.340488857477	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.340488857477	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.34054149626	A rich person does not.
0.0	0.340563002855	It comes from the right, from the left, from people on all sides of the political spectrum.
0.0	0.340578744612	We've already got a great talker in the White House.
0.0	0.340579707475	They have got to quit trying to ship rockets into Gaza that can be used against Israel.
0.0	0.340608040663	Well, first, Judy, I have spent my entire adult life working toward making sure that women are empowered to make their own choices, even if that choice is not to vote for me.
0.0	0.340627766356	You just don't make promises like this.
0.0	0.340812826915	They didn't do that either.
0.0	0.340859770811	We need to arm the Kurds the directly.
0.0	0.340879911639	We've got a president who instead says, we're going to change hearts and minds.
0.0	0.34096734093	We have got to demilitarize local police departments so they do not look like occupying armies.
0.0	0.340988381344	But the voters are savvier than that.
0.0	0.34111736719	We need someone with a steady hand being president of the United States.
0.0	0.34115771651	It's actually evidence of the bias that exists in the American media today.
0.0	0.34135515796	We have to stand with them.
0.0	0.341946353414	You're going away for a long, long while.
0.0	0.342091157893	I am convinced because I see how he works with his attorney general, not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.342117540229	The Democrats can't even come up with one.
0.0	0.342176081896	Maria, I assume that I can respond to that.
0.0	0.342343920893	You know, Hillary Clinton's always saying how Republicans don't follow science?
0.0	0.342351722747	We have work to do, and we now know a lot more than we ever did before.
0.0	0.342415014938	I find it very, very hard to forgive people that deceived me.
0.0	0.342451796767	What have you got now?
0.0	0.342466254468	No, it speaks to the fact that I don't know those --
0.0	0.342479624237	But we are where we are right now.
0.0	0.342910425971	The truth is I had to make some tough calls in some tough times.
0.0	0.342934022758	The only way we're going to solve this problem is with we, the people.
0.0	0.343120785185	But the facts and the law here are really quite clear.
0.0	0.343434125306	They lost a lot of money, everybody said it couldn't be done.
0.0	0.343508494005	So count me in as somebody who will not be listening to Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.34355112996	You can trust me to do the following: that when I get on change with Hillary Clinton, we won't be debating about the science, we'll be debating about the solutions.
0.0	0.343631625966	This issue now has to be about stopping ISIS entering the United States, and when I'm president we will.
0.0	0.343683102437	That is beyond unspeakable.
0.0	0.343749281676	He's wrong.
0.0	0.343996953891	Never been done before, never been done since.
0.0	0.344037693072	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, it is demonstrably true...
0.0	0.344346683399	He was such a nice guy.
0.0	0.34456200301	At least he's honest enough to call himself a socialist.
0.0	0.3447407429	The other Arab countries have a role to play in this.
0.0	0.344926538637	I think maybe my greatest weakness is that I trust people too much.
0.0	0.344926572296	All I'm saying is our next president has to be someone that undoes the damage Barack Obama has done to this country.
0.0	0.344934937772	The second will be to the supreme leader of Iran.
0.0	0.345155376957	Well, let me tell you this.
0.0	0.345293869935	I am not a single- issue candidate, and I do not believe we live in a single-issue country.
0.0	0.34550434938	It was the AFL-CIO.
0.0	0.345551305142	Americans are looking for somebody that's going to give them, and there is a place in this country over the last eight years in particular that talked about hope every day, and they didn't just talk about it, they delivered it.
0.0	0.345926241574	The men and women on this stage have more ideas, more experience, more common sense than every participant in the Democratic debate.
0.0	0.346068232238	You can't deal in China without tariffs.
0.0	0.34613367254	That's the establishment telling us to hide our conservative principles to get the left and the media to like us.
0.0	0.346138551783	I asked my dad after -- obviously, when I found out about this.
0.0	0.346154722294	And as a result of that, the shah of Iran came in, terrible dictator.
0.0	0.346370729496	And that's what I'll offer to the people of the United States in this candidacy for the presidency.
0.0	0.346405676991	But also, I can't fake anger.
0.0	0.346418366764	We have a world that's out of control and has grown dangerous and a president that is weakening our military and making our foreign policy unstable and unreliable in the eyes of our allies.
0.0	0.34654274968	He is a good man.
0.0	0.346581543376	And I'll tell you one thing that we never talk about -- we haven't talked about it tonight.
0.0	0.346677163914	But I think there has to be recognition that if we -- if we are too punitive, then you'll go to other -- other technology companies outside the United States.
0.0	0.346825309714	And I think when you give low-income kids -- African-American, white, Latino kids -- the opportunities to get their lives together, they are not going to end up in jail.
0.0	0.347063744222	No, no.
0.0	0.347083267379	This is the first priority.
0.0	0.347200052177	And we just got to make sure that every American has the tools, in K-through-12 and in vocational education, in higher education.
0.0	0.347447756254	Two quick responses.
0.0	0.347669293605	They don't believe in building walls and a pessimistic view of the future.
0.0	0.347677281539	I mean, literally, the Senate -- what is it, like a French work week?
0.0	0.347682845692	You know, a minute ago, Neil asked: What has President Obama do -- done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns?
0.0	0.347704015449	No Jeb, I don't remember -- well, let me tell you.
0.0	0.347931114138	I will put a price tag.
0.0	0.347992709185	But I do hope that in years to come, just as occurred with Cuba, 10, 20 years ago, people would say, reach normalized relations with Cuba.
0.0	0.34799782447	Let me tell you, everybody, when they say they want to give it to you for free, keep your hands on your wallets because they're coming to you to pay for it.
0.0	0.34845311306	That makes no sense to everybody.
0.0	0.348530944238	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.34854798847	This is the same old stuff since I left.
0.0	0.348733075281	I had to work my way through school.
0.0	0.348757624731	He's a good guy, a smart guy, and he would be a heck of a lot better president than Hillary Rodham Clinton would ever be.
0.0	0.348862334675	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.348862334675	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.348966007661	Well, this is going to be a show me, don't tell me election.
0.0	0.348993460626	We feel like we're being left behind and left out.
0.0	0.348995715601	Right and left are spending us into oblivion.
0.0	0.349140744041	So we have to go after this both abroad and at home.
0.0	0.349197865123	We need to have some coalitions in that part of the world to go after ISIS, but we also need to send a clear message.
0.0	0.349225668133	...I'm going to go to Washington to stop it...
0.0	0.349268817829	If she gets elected, her first 100 days, instead of setting an agenda, she might be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse.
0.0	0.349285120781	There's nobody out there looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.349371294117	And I'm going to do everything I can to address distressed communities, whether they are communities of color, whether they are white communities, whether they are in any part of our country.
0.0	0.349463096365	The government is not supposed to be in every part of our lives, and that is what is causing the problem.
0.0	0.349558201288	Let me -- let me answer your question on the Sun-Sentinel editorial today.
0.0	0.349789125582	You don't know it, they tax us.
0.0	0.350044962652	I would just say that...
0.0	0.35006507617	We have a president of the United States that is undermining this country's security and expanding the role of...
0.0	0.350279346305	I mean the fact is, is that they need to put the pressure on and frankly we need to intercepts ships coming out of North Korea so they don't proliferate all these dangerous materials.
0.0	0.350309997331	And we are going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fall.
0.0	0.350334177009	We used to win, we don't win anymore.
0.0	0.350484603763	I will begin tomorrow to filibuster it.
0.0	0.350552177011	Not a very pleasant place to be.
0.0	0.350593591146	And finally, on health care, why don't we start treating -- keep giving...
0.0	0.350685616954	And this president, given what Ted said right at the beginning, he's absolutely right.
0.0	0.350721306336	You know, a lot of business activity in America is conducted like the guy that does my dry cleaning.
0.0	0.350990813225	You've got to keep asking because this is a hugely important issue.
0.0	0.351004694549	We have been debating right here the core difference between conservatism and progressivism.
0.0	0.351132518303	We need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources, but from sources overseas, that can be a real-time fusion effort to get information where it's needed.
0.0	0.351303558391	And there is no reason that you can't be perfectly fair to the gay community.
0.0	0.35135166129	My background is different.
0.0	0.351371940647	I'm a Catholic, I believe life begins at conception.
0.0	0.351424266367	My plan would sweep all of them into a regulatory framework so we can try to get ahead of what the next problems might be.
0.0	0.351437742747	I will spend every ounce of energy to stop it.
0.0	0.351579720431	That's exactly what we saw.
0.0	0.351594999391	It just needs a corporate executive type at the top that's done it before.
0.0	0.351895386987	Ben Carson, can you do math?
0.0	0.352002632539	He's a left-wing judicial activist, Harvard Law professor who was Al Gore's lawyer in Bush versus Gore.
0.0	0.352002752331	They worked hard to provide us the chance at a better life.
0.0	0.352279848282	Now, Donald...
0.0	0.35236069802	I just hope that by the end of this campaign there will be a lot more supporting me.
0.0	0.352587792734	I don't think it's a war on women for all of us as Americans to stand up and stop harvesting organs from little babies.
0.0	0.35265997789	I talked about Donald Trump from the standpoint of being an individual who was using his celebrity rather than his conservatism.
0.0	0.352679487865	Government causes a problem, and then government steps in to solve the problem.
0.0	0.352739566453	I did a couple of speeches for them, I do speeches for other people.
0.0	0.352770475452	And, it was made for we the people, we are the ones who decide who we are, and we should never give away the values and principles that made America into a great nation for the sake of political correctness.
0.0	0.352931237872	This isn't -- this isn't, you know, a different kind of job.
0.0	0.352976620848	Now, he's doing better.
0.0	0.353075381951	And, they're always going to say, "Well, we're going to fix this one day."
0.0	0.353105859025	I didn't.
0.0	0.353230998932	We have to work with NATO to protect Eastern Europe against any kind of Russian aggression.
0.0	0.3532824989	I have no clue whether the federal government is the proper place, my instinct is to say, hell no, just about everything about the federal government.
0.0	0.35346091043	It's a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.353521569593	As you too know, I know I built a very great company.
0.0	0.353588216243	You will also have to means-test the benefits and declare there's not enough money.
0.0	0.353634658869	John, could I follow up on this?
0.0	0.353848794466	You gotta be -- stick with it, and all that.
0.0	0.354022029615	Do you think that the Chinese, if they had a 45 percent tariff imposed on all their imports wouldn't retaliate and start buying Airbus?
0.0	0.354033775728	...John...
0.0	0.354059729177	I certainly agree with FDR for all the reasons Senator Sanders said.
0.0	0.354203638951	They do it to us, we don't it.
0.0	0.354487551473	It is absolutely absurd to say that I had any kind of a relationship with them.
0.0	0.3545318578	So look, in foreign policy -- in foreign policy, it's strength, but you've got to be cool.
0.0	0.354604623626	They are much more than that.
0.0	0.354685224574	And we can take that message and that formula to Washington to lift every single American to a better life.
0.0	0.355043400014	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.355136451429	And we will be strong again.
0.0	0.355258960119	Not -- not on that, no.
0.0	0.355442078077	Run the company kids, have a good time.
0.0	0.355452221229	Lawrence Tribe and (inaudible) from Harvard -- of Harvard, said that there is a serious question as to whether or not Ted can do this.
0.0	0.355595896027	She said the truth.
0.0	0.355613272172	You know, you look at women working.
0.0	0.355841241747	Maybe we would've gotten a deal where we didn't give everything away.
0.0	0.355879165205	Drugs is one of the greatest scourge in this country, and I spent five years of my administration working with my team to do a whole sort of things to try to reign in the problem of overdoses, and it goes on and on.
0.0	0.35588471434	The reality is that both the African-American community and the white community do marijuana at about equal rates.
0.0	0.356031163179	Both Donald and Jeb have good points, and there is a middle ground.
0.0	0.356550108228	We have to get back into looking at what's causing it.
0.0	0.356621223111	I'm asking people to support me because I think I'm the most qualified, experienced, and ready person to be the president and the commander- in-chief.
0.0	0.356698309525	Community banks are going out of business.
0.0	0.356831230942	And I'm saying we have to get to the bottom of it.
0.0	0.356849590314	And by the way, Jeb you mentioned Boeing, take a look.
0.0	0.356969552128	We can make a stronger program.
0.0	0.357065552644	This issue is not about that anymore.
0.0	0.357183291985	... the best results, wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.357185599078	There are other attorneys that feel, and very, very fine constitutional attorneys, that feel that because he was not born on the land, he cannot run for office.
0.0	0.357348453292	Our next president...
0.0	0.357457394834	You've got to bring people together.
0.0	0.357554386282	You have to have certainty.
0.0	0.357624370653	That's not true.
0.0	0.357694275171	Mr. President, we're not against you.
0.0	0.357795762781	But judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.357876634236	Military action, Maria, would be used when it was absolutely necessary to protect American lives and protect American interests around the world.
0.0	0.358255017419	It did not come from our Judeo-Christian roots, I can tell you that.
0.0	0.358650565267	And as someone who's worn the uniform of the country, that's how we build our military back up.
0.0	0.358702896991	So let's set the facts straight.
0.0	0.358826324651	Yes, they have to stop trying to destabilize the Middle East, causing even more chaos.
0.0	0.358919507233	There are loads of great ideas, great conservative ideas from wonderful think tanks about how to reform the tax code.
0.0	0.359023330771	The terrible, authoritarian, Communist dictatorship he warned us about, now he's urging companies to shut down and move to China.
0.0	0.359190617449	Illegal immigration is beyond belief.
0.0	0.359393501138	They didn't do that.
0.0	0.359584889283	She was naturalized.
0.0	0.359599138934	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.359599138934	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.359761157659	He needs to recognize that those kinds of things are in fact an existential threat to us.
0.0	0.359885279013	And we don't need a weak person being president of the United State, OK?
0.0	0.359977473524	And this president turns his back -- this president doesn't enforce the marijuana laws in this country because he doesn't agree with them.
0.0	0.360166025425	We need to break the Washington cartel, and the only way to do it is to end all the subsidies and all...
1.0	0.360222096142	We have the world's best military, even though he's done everything he can to diminish it.
0.0	0.36034749958	We need to be on the side that keeps Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.360408918781	The domino theory, you know, if Vietnam goes, China, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.
0.0	0.36062364203	I'm tested.
0.0	0.360660219935	I believe in it but we have to be smart and we have to use smart people to negotiate.
0.0	0.360664767125	This is one of the areas I've disagreed with Senator Sanders on, who has called for Iranian troops trying to end civil war in Syria, which I think would be a grave mistake.
0.0	0.360856637111	It turns out we knew something was wrong.
0.0	0.360898652016	Just tell them that, you put people in there, we're going to bomb them.
0.0	0.361200997613	And we would still have governors like Scott Walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions.
0.0	0.361370467105	And right now, I will be putting up a tremendous -- so far, I've put up less than anybody and I have the best results.
0.0	0.361695623035	Here's a fact.
0.0	0.361821050706	Come on, that's just not -- you scare senior citizens with that.
0.0	0.361941635611	No, you did.
0.0	0.362272562814	Now, what I think is that right now we have got to do our best in developing positive relations with Russia.
0.0	0.362306242682	What this campaign is about is creating a process for a political revolution in which millions of Americans, working people who have given up on the political process, they don't think anybody hears their pains or their concerns.
0.0	0.36231610234	Look, in addition to what Donald was saying is we also need to talk about the legal immigration system for permanent residents.
0.0	0.36238088766	I don't know if people understand, but I spent a lifetime with my colleagues getting us to a federal balanced budget.
0.0	0.362497140583	That, I think, between the two of us demonstrates the strength of the support we have among people who want to see change in our country.
0.0	0.362526338859	And sadly, in America today, in our economy, a whole lot of those poor people are African-American.
0.0	0.362559830556	And second, the international crisis we are facing is most dreadful and most dangerous.
0.0	0.362616488254	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.362636721222	I would a whole lot rather had Carly Fiorina over there doing our negotiation than John Kerry.
0.0	0.362655892111	And we're going to just fix everything with waste, fraud, and abuse?
0.0	0.362727873219	It's not my PAC.
0.0	0.362767191804	The fact of the matter is we're not going to have peace -- we are not going to have peace in Syria.
0.0	0.362867337416	When we do business with China, they tax us.
0.0	0.362884506128	I am passionate about what I believe.
0.0	0.363010739585	I was ready to lead, but I wasn't ready to run.
0.0	0.363076750786	I think the American people are look for real leadership.
0.0	0.363138326994	I am convinced that this president, if he could get rid of the Second Amendment, he would.
0.0	0.363182539156	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.363280358573	This president has failed, and when I'm in the Oval Office, police officers will know that they will have the support of the president of the Untied States.
1.0	0.363353830173	It got stolen from them.
0.0	0.363444856716	And I will have done it within 100 days, and it will pass.
0.0	0.363586117861	I think the times are different now.
0.0	0.363635953533	We need somebody ready to be commander-in-chief on day one, who understands there are no moderates in Iran, they've been killed a long time ago.
0.0	0.363701095976	This was a question on entitlements.
0.0	0.363989361216	John Kasich, will you insult two people over here?
0.0	0.364125010042	... no, you already had your chance, Marco, and you blew it.
0.0	0.364198213716	I try to live by the rules, no matter what they are, and I was brought up that way as a kid.
0.0	0.364238632177	You're not interested in an answer.
0.0	0.364259132205	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.3643470471	I will stand firm.
0.0	0.364365334279	It is time to believe in America again.
1.0	0.364369174554	He said, "we don't have leverage with China to get a better deal on Iran because we need them to lend us money to continue operating our government."
0.0	0.364464519866	On the issue of Barack Obama, Barack Obama does not believe that America is a great global power.
0.0	0.364503430958	While there are lots of good ideas for reform, we have never tackled the basics.
0.0	0.364744242585	No, that's -- you're wrong.
0.0	0.364828356384	I ask for your support to build, together, a safer and stronger America.
0.0	0.365034024149	I just want to remind you, people paid their money.
0.0	0.365174048553	It's easier to talk to your friends.
0.0	0.365336335643	It goes away.
0.0	0.365549381935	Big and powerful use big and powerful government to their advantage.
0.0	0.365672800853	If I am president of the United States, we're going to send soldiers back to Iraq, back to Syria, to keep us from being attacked here and keep soldiers in Afghanistan because we must.
0.0	0.365799756632	They discussed how -- how hard it is to sell tractors in China, because all the regulatory barriers.
0.0	0.365935354557	And in your heart of hearts, you cannot wait to see a debate between Hillary Clinton and Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.365938238388	This mandatory sentencing, a very bad idea.
0.0	0.366130617532	The Emanuel AME church killings.
0.0	0.366239449635	Nobody wants to watch three and a half, or three hours.
0.0	0.366332663816	I would not place one American life at risk unless it was absolutely necessary.
0.0	0.366477544442	If we reengage and get involved, yeah, we can have health care for all people, we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.366563892855	And when you have insider information, which apparently has been the case, where people use that information and use big data to try to take advantage of it, there has to be some regulation.
0.0	0.366973653265	It's called the mainstream media who every single day...
0.0	0.367010841239	I find -- I mean, it's just a very different, you know, historical perspective here.
0.0	0.36710773175	I mean, that's just the bottom line.
0.0	0.367152271589	They're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.367309493999	The reason all of us are here is we believe we should be fighting for the working men and women of this country, and not Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.367311001979	I'm the only guy on this stage -- you know, everybody has an "only guy" -- "I'm the only guy this; I'm the only guy that."
0.0	0.367372027409	It's why you see the pharmaceuticals getting together.
0.0	0.367472064604	They're a feeding frenzy for sick people.
0.0	0.367811091521	So the indignation that you carry on, some of the stuff, you have to also own then.
0.0	0.367869143058	You don't have to guess about it, because I actually have a record.
0.0	0.367889382685	They've got to quit sponsoring Hezbollah and Hamas.
0.0	0.367914130834	I have no idea.
0.0	0.367963230761	Well, let us level with the American people.
0.0	0.368118165646	As far as the wall is concerned, we're going to build a wall.
0.0	0.368215640441	And the fact is those jobs are critical, they're hard working members of the middle class and they need to be paid attention to because they're Americans and they carry the load.
0.0	0.368280564017	Are you concerned like I am that the debt and deficits of Washington, D.C. are endangering America's future?
0.0	0.368327277195	We can't just allow it to continue on its current path the way that Hillary Clinton wants to do because there'll be major reductions in benefits in the next decade if we do nothing.
0.0	0.36834334099	They're making a half, two-thirds what they used to make.
0.0	0.368392265105	I was mentioned in the question.
0.0	0.368421437639	And it is difficult to in any way argue with the goal that we both share.
0.0	0.368469433584	I will be that new leader.
0.0	0.368693271869	Here's the bottom line.
0.0	0.368728757489	Let me just close it out this way.
0.0	0.36881225696	America is back in the leadership business.
0.0	0.369037038908	Credibility counts.
0.0	0.369074958144	No one is a socialist.
0.0	0.369122935992	You spend the money today and then you hope you're going to save money tomorrow.
0.0	0.369224002352	(inaudible).
0.0	0.369285439335	I happen to believe that Putin is doing what he is doing because his economy is increasingly in shambles and he's trying to rally his people in support of him.
0.0	0.369305087505	I'm interested in making sure we get the maximum amount of revenue from those who can well afford to provide it.
0.0	0.369370835346	And this summer, we didn't do that.
0.0	0.369492961718	And, this is what I am finding throughout America.
0.0	0.36968730119	Well, I was pleased that NATO announced just this week that they're going to start doing patrols in the Mediterranean, in the Aegean, to try to interdict the smugglers, to try to prevent the kind of tragedies that we have seen all too often, also to try to prevent more refugees from coming to the European Union.
0.0	0.369694031857	That's essentially what we have now, and we don't need that.
0.0	0.369705539787	We need a ground force in Iraq and Syria, and America has to be part of that ground force.
0.0	0.369832585953	That's the end of the conversation.
0.0	0.369960341475	And that is that one of the things you're watching tonight are 11 quality candidates debating an important issue.
0.0	0.369971929327	Look, every time the Federal Government gets engaged in something it gets worse.
0.0	0.370006500868	And, the only way -- no...
0.0	0.370042776969	We now have much more information about what must be done to fix our criminal justice system.
0.0	0.370057270642	We need to lead a force, a Sunni led force inside of Syria.
0.0	0.370100571691	So I'm asking women, I'm asking men, to support me because I'm ready to go into the White House on January 20th, 2017 and get to work on both domestic and foreign policy challenges.
0.0	0.37021338143	That is not what America is supposed to be about.
0.0	0.370431058489	Thank you, senator.
0.0	0.370498085122	In fact, that's part of the problem.
0.0	0.370614158208	And that problem is too big regulations like the EPA, too much new taxes on business that we have seen and "Obamacare."
0.0	0.370621310766	I am deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.370718962605	And we know of the tragic, terrible event that lead to the death of Dontre Hamilton right here in Milwaukee, a young man unarmed, who should still be with us.
0.0	0.370841125833	It's why you see the banks consolidating.
0.0	0.370955955763	Well, if that's the case, we're going to win every state, if Bernie Sanders is the nominee.
0.0	0.37101622343	We have got to destroy their training camps over there before they can attack us here.
0.0	0.371171920066	And we need to do that throughout the country.
0.0	0.371243293162	I was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came.
0.0	0.371281219708	I have no illusion.
0.0	0.371375183377	And I was going to tell you, whether I'm president or not, we better make it clear to the Saudis that we're going to support you, we're in relation with you just like we were in the first Gulf War, but you've got to knock off the funding and teaching of radical clerics who are the very people who try to destroy us and will turn around and destroy them.
0.0	0.371581542348	When I was in Washington, I fought to get the budget balanced.
0.0	0.371789895321	The president has done an executive order with respect to illegal immigration that is illegal.
0.0	0.371833817985	He might not take my phone call, but he would get the message, and the message is this: Until you open every nuclear and every military facility to full, open, anytime/anywhere, for real, inspections, we are going to make it as difficult as possible for you to move money around the global financial system.
0.0	0.372048387297	Wait a minute, who in their 16th month?
0.0	0.372264537025	At that particular point in time, then Americans will believe that Washington is up to a conversation to deal with the millions of people that are here illegally, but not until.
0.0	0.372360910526	They are trying to attack us here in America.
0.0	0.372414718903	No, I said, " I would use -- " they were asking me what to do about North Korea.
1.0	0.373053530117	I didn't have an involvement with them.
0.0	0.373139963679	Now it is their time to help the middle class.
0.0	0.373173844585	Well, first off, what we don't do is do what Hillary Clinton and John Kerry and Barack Obama want us to do, which is their solution for everything, put more taxes on it, give more money to Washington, D.C., and then they will fix it.
0.0	0.373264396638	I know what it's like to owe that money, and we've worked hard.
0.0	0.373327152359	And here's the last piece...
0.0	0.373412840591	We're seeing it in my state and we'll see it in this country.
0.0	0.373429286272	Now, the challenge we're seeing today is that the Supreme Court is being converted into some type of political body.
0.0	0.373501069578	The first thing is we have to strengthen our alliances around the world.
0.0	0.37354202041	Well, I think, Judy, what has to be appreciated is that, as a result of the disastrous and illegal behavior on Wall Street, millions of lives were hurt.
0.0	0.373545622876	Imagine a country where the middle class can get rising income again.
0.0	0.373581400133	Now, you've got Europe.
0.0	0.373584758081	... on the issue -- on the issue of citizenship, Donald...
0.0	0.373612598627	I was down there, and I've never seen anything like it.
0.0	0.373682702117	And Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will say it's those evil rich people.
0.0	0.373755571127	Not bad.
0.0	0.373889999677	He was on the board.
0.0	0.373989844486	We have to lead a coalition that will take back territory from ISIS.
0.0	0.374030314332	They can't even make a deal.
0.0	0.374035275219	But here's the best solution of all.
0.0	0.374525426869	So let's demand open trade but fair trade in this country.
0.0	0.374534368246	That's not even an issue.
0.0	0.374536300494	Reforms, everything from moral and cultural issues to economic issues.
0.0	0.374973217808	And then we need to shut down -- we need to shut down their mechanisms of funding and attack their command-and-control centers.
0.0	0.375078976785	Here's why, the president of the United States and both his attorney's general, they give the benefit of the doubt to the criminal, not to the police officers.
0.0	0.375178863118	And you put me on that stage against her next September, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.375196937629	This is absolutely disgusting, and revolts the conscience of the nation.
0.0	0.375240431011	And if I could say just one thing.
0.0	0.375359276017	You get the Congress, you get the Senate, you get together, you do legislation.
0.0	0.375452162471	And by the way, I hope we can end the trade embargo with Cuba as well.
0.0	0.375572303751	So the answer is no and what Jeb said is absolutely correct.
0.0	0.375875584342	Well, it ain't Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.375934513288	And I say that to Nikki.
0.0	0.376098783185	2016 is going to be a fight between conservatism, and a Democrat party that is undermining the very character of this nation.
0.0	0.376146866742	Are you serious about this election?
0.0	0.376178345587	How about talking about the substantive issues the people care about?
0.0	0.376186615884	If we do that again, we will lose again, we will deserve to lose again.
0.0	0.376211759891	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.376397053364	A lot has happened in nine months.
0.0	0.376426442993	The fact of the matter is he doesn't realize that we now live in the 21st century, and that war is very different than it used to be before.
0.0	0.376658357901	We need to take a new approach of taxing -- reforming how we tax, and reforming the regulations in our -- in our country before it's too late.
0.0	0.376677749677	Every time he's got a chance, going all the way back to -- remember that Great Beer Summit he had after he messed up that time.
0.0	0.376961366808	So I know Secretary Kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease-fire up as quickly as possible.
0.0	0.37731934718	But mostly, the highest calling of leadership is to challenge the status-quo and unlock the potential of others.
0.0	0.377585332752	And also, I've been tested in a way no one else has.
0.0	0.377640233965	Now, I find it rather amazing, because I happen to believe that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country.
0.0	0.37782176858	They do not get any credit for their care-taking responsibilities.
0.0	0.377997608289	We're running.

0.0	0.378310742543	Do people not care about all of our sacrifice?
0.0	0.378440213915	Senator Cruz is precisely right.
0.0	0.378564283336	How do we utilize our intellect rather than allowing the government to use its, quote, "intellect," in order to help us to be able to live healthier and better lives?
0.0	0.378581333971	I know some people like to say, "well, this is free money."
0.0	0.378636247995	The agreement on a cease-fire, though, is something that has to be implemented more quickly than the schedule that the Russians agreed to.
0.0	0.378757935576	You know how many votes John McCain missed when he was carrying out that furious comeback that you're now modeling after?
0.0	0.378894870442	And you're not serious about destroying ISIL.
0.0	0.378982858112	We elected a president that is weakening America on the global stage.
0.0	0.379050100463	...you wrote a story on it, and you had to go back and correct it.
0.0	0.379076657066	Young people for whom getting involved in politics is as, you know, it's like going to the moon.
0.0	0.379465151098	And it is a -- the kind of criticism that we've heard from Senator Sanders about our president I expect from Republicans.
0.0	0.3794673325	So you know the New York Times and I don't have exactly have the warmest of relationships.
0.0	0.37953151034	It always seems to be the private marketplace does a better job.
0.0	0.3797200521	I don't think anybody has cut that much government anywhere, at any time.
0.0	0.379768788627	And in fact I would go further.
0.0	0.379780991293	Could I -- could I bring something up here, because I'm a constituent of the senator and I helped him and I expected that he would do constituent service, which means that he shows up to work.
0.0	0.379810219744	I want a government so small I can barely see it.
0.0	0.379991887733	He's missing the whole point, that America's leadership in the world is required for peace and stability.
0.0	0.380003908949	You don't have seven children and bring them into this world if you're not optimistic about the future of this country.
0.0	0.380057721653	Donald is right that China is running over President Obama like he is a child, President Obama is not protecting American workers and we are getting hammered.
0.0	0.380095202906	He is the party's frontrunner right now, and good for him.
0.0	0.380139882789	But you haven't asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought I'd get that off my chest if you don't mind.
0.0	0.380274015652	We actually did it.
0.0	0.380565291164	The questions that have been asked so far in this debate illustrate why the American people don't trust the media.
0.0	0.380649374249	And that's why this study, which shows that if you can believe it today, for white working class people between 45 and 54, life expectancy is actually going down.
0.0	0.380670526101	You can't do nothing.

0.0	0.381070826602	It's not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.381355469992	We've worked hard our whole life to provide a better family -- a better life for our family.
0.0	0.381582279077	We'd rebuild infrastructure that would also create jobs in this country, and we'd work with the states to do it the right way, to do it more efficiently and more effectively.
0.0	0.381671888664	The people aren't dumb.

0.0	0.382521425964	The American people are never going to trust Washington, D.C., and for good reason.
0.0	0.382580532809	They're concerned that Washington is so dysfunctional it is holding them back.
0.0	0.382622502294	Lots of people will say lots of different things about me in this campaign and others, but the one thing they've never said about me is that I'm misunderstood.
0.0	0.382818021422	The questions that are being asked shouldn't be trying to get people to tear into each other.
0.0	0.382838062465	It's like them getting mugged, and then us saying, well, we're going to mug you some more.
0.0	0.382858532003	A healthy environment, a strong economy and energy independent America -- that would be the purpose of my presidency, is break the strangle hold that people enjoy on fossil fuels who hate our guts.
0.0	0.382934552424	I'm going to prioritize those recipients who need the most help first.
0.0	0.383342094587	Well, you know what?

0.0	0.385169207978	If I have a weakness, it's that I try to live by the rules.
0.0	0.385398296628	And the problem today is there's no confidence in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.385468439855	He is not the only one.
0.0	0.385484511174	It puts us on a level, even playing field, which brings jobs here at home...

0.0	0.385666104255	That's why George Romney, Mitt's dad, was eligible to run for president, even though he was born in Mexico.
0.0	0.38571549474	You know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in America.
0.0	0.385798075119	I laid out a plan at the Citadel to do just that and it starts with creating a "No Fly Zone" and "Safe Zones" to make sure refugees are there.
0.0	0.385892276658	... you know, the -- the -- the fact of the matter is -- you know, if we fix the taxation system, make it absolutely fair, and get rid of the incredible regulations -- because every regulation is a tax, it's a -- on goods and services.
0.0	0.385893930975	Those are two leaders that I admire very much.

0.0	0.386833855792	I don't care.
1.0	0.386863955327	Becky, it is the height of hypocrisy for Mrs. Clinton to talk about being the first woman President, when every single policy she espouses, and every single policy of President Obama has been demonstrably bad for women.
0.0	0.387055248543	We have to shut down, whether or not they're in prisons preaching or on -- in mosques preaching.
0.0	0.387113956869	For the people who say we can't do it, I say hell no, we can do it together.
0.0	0.38717859838	Well, I would begin by reminding people that at this point in previous presidential elections, Jimmy Carter couldn't win, Ronald Reagan couldn't win, Bill Clinton couldn't win, and neither could've Barack Obama.
0.0	0.387219979239	In fact, he's done worse than nothing.
0.0	0.387231946705	And as Reagan demonstrated, if we cut taxes, we can bring back growth.
0.0	0.387393027297	Thanks for coming back to me, Maria.
0.0	0.387578004527	I'm totally open to a tariff.
0.0	0.387637516482	We need to use our technological advantages, because what we've warned of is an international guerrilla movement that threatens this country.
0.0	0.387677509064	Trying to get Iran and Saudi Arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter.
0.0	0.387695752234	But if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in Flint.
1.0	0.387758729946	When we have more people in jail, disproportionately African American and Latino, than China does, a communist authoritarian society four times our size.
0.0	0.388042137443	... tariffs that come against us.
0.0	0.388225005145	A brief response.
0.0	0.388286155449	In my view healthcare is a right of all people, not a privilege, and I will fight for that.
0.0	0.388530091677	But in terms of shutting down the government, I don't think President Obama should choose to shut down the government simply to send taxpayer dollars to this group that has been caught, I believe, breaking the law, but also offending our values and our ethics.
0.0	0.388542650349	I'm not talking about now, I'm talking about in the future they're building massive plants in China because China does not want Boeing building their planes here, they want them built in China, because China happens to be smart the way they do it, not the way we do it.
0.0	0.388667929048	That is what I could do for the country.
0.0	0.388670056581	This is a great nation.

0.0	0.388897455277	You can't have a question.
0.0	0.388980537829	So this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle.
0.0	0.388993984706	We're going to be actually out there trying to create a better life for hard-working Americans.
0.0	0.389076481836	We were wrong.
0.0	0.38931963325	So when Nikki said that, I wasn't offended.
0.0	0.389625015243	I was governor on September 11th, and I'm proud of my leadership in bringing New York through that time.
0.0	0.389756483561	The majority of people in American actually have values and principles and they believe in the very things that made America great.
0.0	0.389926061808	And when countries violate trade agreements or dump product in this country, we need -- we need to stand up against those countries that do that without making them into an enemy.
0.0	0.390415267034	We have ISIS and al Qaeda attacking us.
0.0	0.390443461738	I was one of the original sponsors of the DREAM Act.
0.0	0.390444133689	So what I will tell you about our incentives -- our incentives are tight, and at the end of the day we make sure that we gain more from the creation of jobs than what we lose.

0.0	0.390735044147	They go to Harvard.
0.0	0.390767924409	We have arrived at a point in our nation's history where the potential of this nation and too many Americans is being crushed by the weight, the power, the cost, the complexity, the ineptitude, the corruption of the federal government, and only someone who will challenge the status quo of Washington, D.C. can lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.390802636462	I've watched to see people say that we should dismantle Medicare and Medicaid and leave the senior citizens out -- out in the -- in the cold.
0.0	0.390849099036	They understand that there's a national security risk.
0.0	0.391016170011	Here is the one thing I'm not going to do.
0.0	0.391075848318	We have people out of work.
0.0	0.391281673216	We both want to get more revenue in.
0.0	0.391345967896	Where did that spirit come from in America?
0.0	0.391412206846	The fact is, there is a big overhang.

0.0	0.392055384727	What -- what -- you're from New York?
0.0	0.392484711616	That's not the way the game is supposed to be played.
0.0	0.392805850845	With a couple of additional tweaks, we know what this will do.
0.0	0.392883911989	We have to continue to work with the Iraqi army so that they are better prepared to advance on some of the other strongholds inside Iraq, like Mosul, when they are able to do so.
0.0	0.39316605674	The simple fact is that the world has been torn asunder.
0.0	0.393478701317	Judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.3934990246	They expect to have it.
0.0	0.393514567596	And I will go back to Washington with my plan.
0.0	0.393719492789	If you can encrypt messages, ISIS can, over these platforms, and we have no ability to have a cooperative relationship --
0.0	0.393724601098	And -- and -- you know, the concept of New York values is not that complicated to figure out.
0.0	0.39415282417	And I recognize -- I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa.
0.0	0.394248982307	If you're worried about the world being on fire, you're worried about how we're going to use our military, you're worried about strengthening our military and you're worried most of all about keeping your homes and your families safe and secure, you cannot give Hillary Clinton a third term of Barack Obama's leadership.
0.0	0.394331536411	This president every chance he has ever gotten has tried to undermine the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.394331847659	And if you can't use the term, you're never going to solve the problem.
0.0	0.394481934985	I think America is just a few good decisions and a leadership change at the top away from the best years we've ever had.

0.0	0.395218348572	We're going to bring jobs back from Japan, we're going to bring jobs back from China, we're going to bring, frankly, jobs back from Mexico where, as you probably saw, Nabisco is leaving Chicago with one of their biggest plants, and they're moving it to Mexico.

0.0	0.395522420102	They do celebrate more dependence on the government.
0.0	0.395620781514	You don't have to say that.
0.0	0.395757372837	It would not necessitate us raising any taxes.
0.0	0.396348022231	We're going to lose Social Security and Medicare if Republicans and Democrats do not come together and find a solution like Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill.
0.0	0.396494097864	And by the way, it's not just on immigration, you used to support TPA, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.396603421044	Government trying to level the playing field between Internet and brick-and-mortar creates a problem.
0.0	0.396633888623	And I think once I'm in the White House we will have enough political capital to be able to do that.
0.0	0.396647235129	(APPLAUSE) This is not a cage match.
0.0	0.396866247786	I will deliver for the American people if I have the privilege of leading this country.
0.0	0.397159145131	Can I just add one very quick thing?
0.0	0.397195330854	If you're a farmer, if you're a rancher, if you are small business owner, the death tax is gone.
0.0	0.397478698612	The choice between a weak economy and a strong environment is a false choice, that is not the choice I'll offer America.
0.0	0.397874985693	It takes away discretion from judges.
0.0	0.397965411041	There's a big question mark on your head.
0.0	0.397983024264	No, John.
0.0	0.398070048309	And he said, oh, I'm never going to attack.
0.0	0.398500417638	But I'm not worried about my finances, I'm worried about the finances of everyday Americans who today are struggling in an economy that is not producing good paying jobs while everything else costs more.
0.0	0.398595170697	And in that meeting, I suggested we had a problem with technology, and that I wanted to take people from Silicon Valley into the Pentagon to solve our most significant problems.
0.0	0.39862669392	The answer is simple.
0.0	0.398641026071	We have to offer a compelling alternative that is based on hope and optimism and grounded in serious policy, which I've laid out.
0.0	0.398703779602	You cannot make rash statements and expect the rest of the world to respond as though, well, it's just politics.
0.0	0.398834369061	Terrorism is on the run, China, Russia is advancing their agenda at warp speed, and we pull back.
0.0	0.399176163607	Manufacturing will flow back into this country.
0.0	0.399469664884	We have to put more money.
0.0	0.399592296521	I would also just say this.
0.0	0.399600234001	She is still defending Planned Parenthood, and she is still her party's frontrunner.
0.0	0.399610418615	It would bring the money back into the United States to help build jobs by American companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about.
0.0	0.399783536777	You can -- if you -- you flew in with your 767, didn't you?
0.0	0.39985423476	But somehow for decades, nothing really has changed.
0.0	0.400365041949	And we should back up the recent donors conference to make sure we have made our contribution to try to deal with the enormous cost that these refugees are posing to Turkey and to members of the E.U.
0.0	0.400374607951	What we have got to do is make it clear that any police officer who breaks the law will, in fact, be held accountable.
0.0	0.400432385229	And we will join the rest of the other -- the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families.
0.0	0.4004973943	We need to create jobs.
0.0	0.400661650894	You've got to keep asking.
0.0	0.400875097694	Over time, we're going to become energy independent.
0.0	0.401096234485	They shouldn't be going to Europe.
0.0	0.401206883959	Well, I did.
0.0	0.401227154709	And what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice.
0.0	0.401305444641	But the good news is the next commander-in-chief is standing on this stage.
0.0	0.401506409321	They look around for gun-free zones.
0.0	0.401744070292	Well, first of all the -- the plan gives people the option of -- of opting out.
0.0	0.401987106022	His first election and his re-election.
0.0	0.40211417431	I'm asking folks not just to join my campaign, but join a cause.
0.0	0.402161865241	Work requirements and time limits.
0.0	0.402197732591	But all of my career, you know, having been raised in -- by a mailman father whose father was a coal miner, who died of black lung and was losing his eyesight; or a mother whose mother could barely speak English.
0.0	0.402476135416	Martha, we got a lot of politicians that will kiss babies, cut ribbons, do whatever it takes to be popular.
0.0	0.402522442465	I lead the opposition against it.
0.0	0.40259042263	That's what I've always stood for.
0.0	0.402600250327	I'd sign that executive order.
0.0	0.402900182941	It was a hard choice.
0.0	0.403002345902	We're going to suspend and repeal every executive order, every regulation that cost American jobs and is -- is -- is impacting our freedom.
0.0	0.40316041224	It's peanuts.
0.0	0.403329619891	I know we can do this because we're still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
1.0	0.403580627359	This president is undermining our military.
0.0	0.403586612144	And, if this government doesn't pay it, than tell me what's different between the government and Bernie Madolf, who sits in prison today for doing less than what the government has done to the people on social security and Medicare in this country.
0.0	0.403671183791	In my view, it doesn't go anywhere near far enough.
0.0	0.403687496739	And I'll go back to something that had been mentioned just a few minutes ago.
0.0	0.403729155995	... wants to face Donald Trump in the general election.
0.0	0.40422292742	The fact of the matter is we the American people are not each other's enemies, it's those people who are trying to divide us who are the enemies.
0.0	0.404290134057	The last thing we need is to throw our country into a contentious debate about health care again.
0.0	0.404766774963	We would still have LGBT people who get married on Saturday and get fired on Monday.
0.0	0.40525616307	Bill, I want to say one more thing about...
0.0	0.405458997753	But it is a general economic issue.
0.0	0.405838548287	But I promise you, in the state of South Carolina, they do.
0.0	0.40598068559	I want to find out -- many people saw pipe bombs and all sorts of things all over their apartment.
0.0	0.406015138822	Under -- under Barack Obama and the proposals of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and others, they've tried it their way, and it has failed miserably.
0.0	0.40604519256	I am a little skeptical about your governor actually caring enough about higher education to make any kind of commitment like that.
0.0	0.406152763032	We also need a nominee, a candidate who will endorse our own principles.
0.0	0.406218374978	Well, first of all, if a company gets caught doing that, they should never be able to use the program again.
0.0	0.406358464948	I think it was a mistake to expand Medicaid everywhere in Ohio and across the country.
0.0	0.406487923815	Thirdly, we need to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to send a serious signal that we're back in the game with Israel --
0.0	0.406502243741	But, here is a pledge I've made throughout this campaign, and it's really not a very radical pledge.
0.0	0.406554093153	Let's quit blaming the people on Social Security.
0.0	0.406578895469	I didn't say permanently.
0.0	0.406627251783	She'd be a great president of the United States because the leadership she brought to H.P.
0.0	0.406713244342	We would still have sexism preventing women from getting equal pay.
0.0	0.406723971474	They can't -- when they order the product and when they finally get the product it is taxed.
0.0	0.407097704422	That's real moral authority that we need in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.407144799376	None of these instances that the president points to as the reason why he's doing these things would have been preventive.
0.0	0.407208164021	We are in a war against ISIS.
0.0	0.407352851187	Why didn't they call the police?
1.0	0.407362510397	And on Common Core, Common Core has been eliminated in New Jersey.
0.0	0.407411475449	I've tried to be as specific to answer questions so that my proposals can be vetted, because I feel like we have to level with people for the very reason, Gwen, that you are mentioning.
0.0	0.407571421687	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.407571421687	It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...
0.0	0.407684099826	Donald Trump actually seized on it when he talked about immigration.
0.0	0.407834814751	Our rights come from God.
0.0	0.40810960969	You know, I am by my nature impatient.
0.0	0.408169703133	But we're running for the presidency of the United States here.
0.0	0.408246438167	Our vets are being treated horribly.
0.0	0.408316564389	You got Kuwait and you got Qatar and you got Saudi Arabia.
0.0	0.40833438091	He just writes out an executive order.
0.0	0.408354282244	Well, one of us ran against Barack Obama.
0.0	0.408587958838	...Then I'll buy you a tequila...
0.0	0.408735345999	And the fact is it was wrong.
0.0	0.408758341577	I believe in the PTT because it's important those countries in Asia are interfacing against China.
0.0	0.4091342548	You have to lead.
0.0	0.40924554144	They get them on the black market.
0.0	0.409418878644	Where are you gonna clean it up?
0.0	0.409719942839	We know (ph) to go ahead and shut off the supply routes, and send in our special ops at 2:00 a.m. and attack them everywhere they go.
0.0	0.41014205647	Fiscal discipline, know what you're doing.
0.0	0.410325750904	I can see why people are angry and scared, because this president has created a condition where our national security has weakened dramatically.
0.0	0.410351825032	And the reason is simple: because in 2008, we elected as president someone who wasn't interested in fixing America.
0.0	0.410410524899	It's kind of basic.
0.0	0.410525574896	I want to go back to what we were talking about earlier, this budget deal in Washington.
0.0	0.410793277315	They don't like somebody else like David Petraeus, they prosecute them and send a decorated general on to disgrace.
0.0	0.410884777032	I've had more calls on that statement that Ted made -- New York is a great place.
0.0	0.410998463278	But realistically, even if they do, the money is flowing.
0.0	0.411066423302	You know, of the few questions I've got, the last one I need is to give him some more time.
0.0	0.411268698197	Look, I am deeply concerned about what's happening in every community in America, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths.
0.0	0.411476315266	Not supposed to happen that way.
1.0	0.411636649658	First of all, I didn't support Sonia Sotomayor.
0.0	0.411673291965	The Republican Party is blessed to have 11 good candidates, (inaudible) 10 good candidates.
0.0	0.411677422237	Marco Rubio, why don't you resign?
0.0	0.412048250924	It worked for Reagan and it works for our team in Ohio.
0.0	0.412052423068	Because this president has consistently underestimated the threat of ISIS.
0.0	0.41222424598	Crony capitalism is alive and well, and has been so in Washington, D.C. for decades.
0.0	0.412607650037	s entrenched problems head-on.
0.0	0.412636869583	Yeah, again, as I said, we're raising a family in the 21st century and it's one of the reasons why my tax plan is a pro- family tax plan.
0.0	0.412644309147	Obama broke every rule of negotiation.
0.0	0.412808206485	We need to be very well aware of the fact that China and Russia are using technology to attack us, just as ISIS is using technology to recruit those who would murder American citizens.
0.0	0.41288014302	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the free enterprise system.
1.0	0.413029816162	And Iranian wise guys having guns to their heads.
0.0	0.413174010143	According to the FBI and the director of national intelligence, Syria's becoming a perfect platform to strike our nation.
0.0	0.41336150071	Every progressive economist who has analyzed that says that the numbers don't add up, and that's a promise that cannot be kept, and it's really important now that we are getting into the rest of the country that both of us are held to account for explaining what we are proposing because, especially with healthcare, this is not about math.
0.0	0.413403914452	Putting Iranian troops right on the border of the Golan right next to Israel would be a nonstarter for me.
0.0	0.413483990694	I believe we are on the path to doing that.
0.0	0.413682450409	I will tell you, you could win a bet at a bar tonight, since we're talking about fantasy football, if you ask who the top three states in America are that produce solar energy: California and Arizona are easy, but number three is New Jersey.
0.0	0.413821972623	He's wrong.
0.0	0.413828689142	They're very concerned about it.
0.0	0.413881153279	I saw them come down.
0.0	0.413925855918	You know, Obama has presented the American people with a false choice every time.
0.0	0.413952649798	No, I think the idea was that president -- then-Senator Obama was wrong for suggesting that it is a good idea to talk to your opponents.
0.0	0.414046803531	And that's how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America.
0.0	0.414143597117	And I appreciate greatly Senator Sanders' voting record.
0.0	0.414173053517	I want to get ahead of those, and that's why I've proposed a much more comprehensive approach to deal with all of these...
0.0	0.414454841828	I'll tell them that we're going to grow the economy so that we can give people better opportunities so they don't have to rely exclusively on benefit types of programs.
0.0	0.414496302416	Look, it takes three things basically to grow jobs.
0.0	0.414809214053	If this country that does not keep its promise to seniors then what promise can this country hope to be trusted to keep?
0.0	0.415046016738	And make sure you enhance savings in the private market.
0.0	0.415095139555	It will cause the economy to grow, to explode, to create more jobs.
0.0	0.415268364727	And when I'm president, we're not just going to have a president that gives a State of the Union and says America is the greatest country in the world.
0.0	0.415286049306	And at the end of the day, it was the president's decision.
0.0	0.415358842419	My father was born in Italy, and shortly after he was born my grandfather immigrated to this country.
0.0	0.415444728334	I will run on my record all day long.
0.0	0.415703440414	It will create a manufacturing juggernaut in this country.
0.0	0.415843555563	We have made it easier to do that, not harder.
0.0	0.415935306688	And not only did I fight them and win, I lived to tell about it and I'm standing on this stage tonight as evidence of that.
0.0	0.415954913495	If they can't regulate themselves, then the NFL needs to look at just, you know, moving away from them a little bit.
0.0	0.41607891686	This isn't just the country I was born in, this is the nation that literally changed the history of my family.
0.0	0.41611974423	And in that interview, he explained his views on a whole host of issues that were very, very different from the views he's describing now.
0.0	0.41642807885	It's "give me options on how I can make it harder for law-abiding people to buy guns."
0.0	0.416640612938	He was overthrown by British and American interests because he threatened oil interests of the British.
0.0	0.416739661361	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, the slower the economy becomes.
0.0	0.41684786352	Now, I can tell you there are a lot of private-sector things that you could do with $12,500, which will get you a lot more than you get from this government program.
0.0	0.416905126382	Why aren't we talking about -- instead of cutting benefits for old people, cutting benefits for sick people -- why don't we say, "let's cure the four big cost-driving diseases...
0.0	0.416934112169	We're going to bring jobs and manufacturing back.
0.0	0.417007938368	And you can't do that to the party.
0.0	0.417026009511	Because what she will do is come in and she will raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.417072251533	Our legal immigration system from now on has to be merit-based.
0.0	0.417312338989	Why in God's name does Wall Street...
0.0	0.417552057013	So -- you know, you shouldn't misrepresent how well you're doing with the polls.
0.0	0.417635781146	We ought to give them a little bit of a liability release so that they share data amongst themselves and share data with the federal government, they're not fearful of a lawsuit.
0.0	0.417788060763	We have to show that we can march to a balanced budget.
0.0	0.418122383126	We need to reverse that.
0.0	0.418176063877	They go to Yale.
0.0	0.41826103373	We're going to get more revenue.
0.0	0.418304838243	We have to end crony capitalism in Washington, where the lobbyists and the powerful can get tax breaks and tax credits, and the American people don't get laws in their interest.
0.0	0.418577474119	But as Bill said earlier, Roe v. Wade, it's has been the law for 42 years, and I don't think we should continue to try to change it.
0.0	0.418580999228	So, also, we can stimulate the economy.
0.0	0.418597725036	Well, I've learned the rules on this.
0.0	0.418659057307	We can't do this unilaterally.
0.0	0.418818806071	We own a home four blocks away from the place that I grew up in.
0.0	0.419121761406	If we means test Social Security, it means that the government decides whether or not I deserve it.
0.0	0.419591247723	And what I think all of us are saying is, our monetary policy, our tax policy, regulatory policy needs to be radically changed so we can create high sustained growth for income to rise.
0.0	0.41968218716	First of all, John got lucky with a thing called fracking, OK?
0.0	0.420033735996	That should be a right of all Americans regardless of the income of their families.
0.0	0.420054835518	But, I would also add this.
0.0	0.420461337422	You have to deal with entitlements, you have to be in a position to control discretionary spending.
0.0	0.420581468789	You know, she only had a third-grade education, but -- you know, she knew how to stretch a dollar.
0.0	0.420780591039	And this is not an endeavor that rewards that.
0.0	0.420868777753	Because only if it's about three pages are you leveling the playing field between the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected who can hire the armies of lawyers and accountants and, yes, lobbyists to help them navigate their way through 73,000 pages.
0.0	0.420989006598	Let me (inaudible).
0.0	0.421266144545	And that is what they told me when I was in Jordan in November.
0.0	0.421361709488	So he had to leave the Situation Room after hearing from the small group advising him and he had to make that decision.
0.0	0.421391609712	We lose with one of the worst deals I've ever seen negotiated of any kind, that's our recent catastrophe with Iran.
1.0	0.421509190959	They were wrong.
0.0	0.421515336228	But if I become president, I couldn't care less about my company.
0.0	0.421522831768	Jeb Bush says we've got to be willing to lose the primary in order to win the general.
0.0	0.422003943439	We're going to have a big, fat beautiful door right in the middle of the wall.
0.0	0.422126494042	Give Bernie Sanders credit.
0.0	0.422181938136	The American people have rejected your agenda and now you're trying to go around it.
0.0	0.422287337461	But I would probably have my children run it with my executives and I wouldn't ever be involved because I wouldn't care about anything but our country, anything.

0.0	0.423903216481	She actually ran against one of my friends and our head of public safety.
0.0	0.423968624445	This is incredibly complicated, because we've got Iran as a big player, in addition to Russia.
0.0	0.424069425298	Let me give you one quick example.
0.0	0.42421674642	And there's a bunch of things my tax plan does to help them.

0.0	0.42451312421	I -- I've been for pausing on admitting the Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.424667876163	I think what our campaign is indicating is that the American people are tired of establishment politics, tired of establishment economics.
0.0	0.424713219716	I am proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend.

0.0	0.425942457063	They were wrong.
0.0	0.426033150419	So I believe that working with Europe -- and, by the way, you know, we've got some very wealthy countries there in that part of the world.
0.0	0.426227095692	That is not protected religious belief.
0.0	0.426278421997	John, I -- if I -- a lot of people have jumped in here.
0.0	0.426398477728	I mean, let me be honest with the people who are watching at home.
0.0	0.426484007121	Is there going to be any change in the House with new leadership?

0.0	0.427025185359	Atlantic City has gone bad.
0.0	0.427134035107	Almost every hotel in Atlantic City has either been in bankruptcy or will be in bankruptcy -- the biggest.

0.0	0.427349723795	Our greatest days lie ahead if we are willing to do what it takes now.
0.0	0.427505979058	And, we said no.
0.0	0.427580497512	My parents in this country were able to give me the chance to do all the things they never did.
0.0	0.427863366247	I think it's -- yeah, I think it's a one-two punch.
0.0	0.427872034527	They know we will be committed to victory.
0.0	0.42817285414	We both have a lot of small donors.

0.0	0.428344416872	You know, I sat down with the senior leadership of John Deere.
0.0	0.428362014696	It seems to me that given our history as a nation that has been a beacon of hope for the oppressed, for the downtrodden, that I very strongly disagree with those Republican candidates who say, you know what, we've got to turn our backs on women and children who left their home with nothing, nothing at all.
0.0	0.428431194778	... you're not going to have peace in Syria with Assad in charge.

0.0	0.428690386431	The people that Washington leaves behind.
0.0	0.428708278994	All over this country we have Republican candidates for president saying we hate the government.
0.0	0.428845341547	I would change them.
0.0	0.428855252766	We have to put the personnel on that border in the right places; you have to put the strategic fencing in place; and you have to have aviation assets that fly all the way from Tijuana to El Paso to Brownsville, Texas -- 1,933 miles looking down 24/7, with the technology to be able to identify what individuals are doing, and ID when they are in obviously illegal activities or suspicious activities, and quick response teams come.
0.0	0.429105256574	But let me just say that we also need down -- to tear down the cyber walls that China is erecting, that Russia is erecting.
0.0	0.429175750137	I'm not -- my campaign is going to be about the future of America, it's not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage.
0.0	0.429445302078	No, not a comic book, and it's not a very nicely asked question the way you say that.
0.0	0.429679669209	And we can no longer continue to sweep it under the rug.
0.0	0.430040124713	Washington gets bigger, taxes get higher, and the American people feel more distance from our government.
0.0	0.430074681057	They are the ones who should respond to any questions.
0.0	0.430084770498	Neil, my name was mentioned as well.
0.0	0.430164033274	There are a lot of training programs and education programs that I think can be streamlined and put into a much better format so that if we do continue them they can be more useful, in public schools, community colleges, and colleges and universities.
0.0	0.430258245646	It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are.
1.0	0.43056162016	And this is not the first time that he has criticized President Obama.
0.0	0.43090777605	I think we have achieved a great deal with the Iranian nuclear agreement to put a lid on the Iranian nuclear weapons program.
0.0	0.431089286378	You can't grow your way out of demographics.
0.0	0.43122146515	This campaign is not just about electing a president.
0.0	0.431532975678	Are you coming onboard a proposal?
0.0	0.431743284585	You can't just ban all Muslims.
0.0	0.432104742387	It is hard to find someone in my generation that thinks Social Security will be there for us.
0.0	0.432405042703	And that's just not acceptable.
0.0	0.432421425959	And so do I.
0.0	0.432508033683	Who can you count on to keep us safer, stronger and freer?
0.0	0.432565566485	So you know, I had to report results every 90 days in excruciating detail.
0.0	0.432645645699	But I will tell you this, Atlantic City, you're using that, hundreds of companies that I have opened have thrived.
0.0	0.432913491169	Akin to slavery, where people came into this country to do guest work were abused, were exploited, and if they stood up for their rights, they'd be thrown out of this country.
0.0	0.433032150499	So what we do, though, is, if there is somebody who is price- gouging, we have laws for prosecutors to take that on.
0.0	0.433101698279	Marco leaves the IRS code in with all of the complexity.
0.0	0.433117807334	We're not going to be able to rebuild it unless we put a no-fly zone there, make it safe for those folks so we don't have to be talking about Syrian refugees anymore.
0.0	0.433532645036	But I recall when Secretary Clinton ran against then-Senator Obama, she was critical of him for suggesting that maybe you want to talk to Iran, that you want to talk to our enemies.
0.0	0.433979671023	That could be the great Trojan Horse.
0.0	0.434201743233	But also where it's affordable, solar, wind in Iowa has become very affordable and it makes sense.
0.0	0.434338979543	That is the way to deal with China at the end of the day.
0.0	0.434538467091	I'm proud that I gave him that advice.
0.0	0.434713107166	I've seen plenty of other people follow up?
0.0	0.434986421068	And let me tell you, ISIS and terrorists do not get their guns from a gun show.
0.0	0.435048507793	Why should we let their people be sitting there smoking their cigars, sitting in their comfortable chairs in Raqqa?
0.0	0.435178190367	And my record was one of cutting taxes each and every year.
0.0	0.435637944494	They are worried to death about the future of their kids.
0.0	0.435923222477	And that free education of extraordinary accomplishment was from first grade to 12th grade.
0.0	0.436266557311	The matter is what orders exist now that shouldn't exist?
0.0	0.436487135611	I don't agree that we're going to occupy and spend another decade or a trillion dollars.
0.0	0.436522356879	If she gets elected, she's under investigation with the FBI right now.
0.0	0.436531982359	Instead, the Washington establishment raised both.
0.0	0.436764566174	It was the week she got exposed as a liar.
0.0	0.436936854463	So this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement.
0.0	0.436969999955	And that's what we have to contrast.
0.0	0.437425624531	It's their money.
0.0	0.437665734687	... believe me the world is peanuts by comparison.
0.0	0.437932632001	I support NAFTA.
0.0	0.437944052945	Imagine how hard it is for these people out there that are making 40, 50, $60,000 a year, and they're trying to provide for their families at a time when this economy is not growing.
0.0	0.438010027309	Obamacare, we're going to repeal it and replace it.
0.0	0.438030147582	People have worked their entire lives.
0.0	0.43818013247	Look, under President Obama and Secretary Clinton, they're working hard to change the American dream into the European nightmare.
0.0	0.43827324096	The big corporations have the scale to deal with all of this.
0.0	0.43835172993	Whether it's welfare reform and getting something back for the hard-earned taxpayers; whether it's engaging in Pentagon reform and taking on the big contractors that were charging thousands of dollars for hammers and screw drivers and ripping us off; or whether it's taking on the special interests in the nursing home industry in Ohio, so that mom and dad can have the ability to stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.
0.0	0.438384369	We pay federal taxes.
0.0	0.438764633384	We got to do a lot about the high cost of high -- higher education, but we've got to make sure we're training people for jobs that exist, that are good jobs that can pay.
1.0	0.438912781739	We don't need the federal government to be involved in this at all.
0.0	0.439020326415	That's what I said.
0.0	0.439194173996	Now we're having smaller families.
0.0	0.439423133594	They said they'd shrink and balance the budget.
0.0	0.439423409167	Neil, Neil -- can I say one thing about this.
0.0	0.439835855943	And meanwhile, small businesses are getting crushed.
0.0	0.439972566565	In her world, cap- and-trade would dominate, that we will destroy the economy in the name of helping the environment.
0.0	0.439979207813	But honestly, if you're a small business owner today you are being crushed.
0.0	0.440011600473	And we can't be the stupid country any more.
0.0	0.440030267259	I can't do it.
0.0	0.440030267259	We can't do it.
0.0	0.440179676988	You look at California, you look, frankly, at Paris where there's a -- the strictest no-gun policy of any city anywhere in the world, and you see what happens: 130 people dead with many to follow.
0.0	0.440203638076	I am all in favor of keeping these talented people here so they can go to work in Silicon Valley.
0.0	0.440845050492	Our best days are in front of us.
0.0	0.440947237886	But in addition to that, we have to have fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.441041612281	Let us actually go to zero- based budgeting so we know where the money is being spent.
0.0	0.441692439199	But I'd sign a second one, as I did in New York, as well, having a hard hiring freeze on adding new employees except for the military or defense-related positions.
0.0	0.441837927902	Somebody who is very fond of the president, agrees with him most of the time, I disagree with his recent deportation policies.
0.0	0.441850315301	Helping business make profits.
0.0	0.441864740839	If you're running for president of the United States and you do not understand that we cannot defend this nation without more of our soldiers over there, you are not ready for this job.
0.0	0.442003053969	It should be what are your substantive positions...
0.0	0.442050825537	And the Obama-Clinton economy has left behind the working men and women of this country.
0.0	0.442213294086	You bet they do.
0.0	0.442247902999	It was the first time we did it since man walked on the moon.
0.0	0.442375387913	I used the tithing analogy.
0.0	0.442509734711	...is the lowest personal rate any candidate up here has, and what it would also enable us to do is for every citizen to fill out their taxes on a postcard so we can eliminate the IRS.
0.0	0.442620570898	It is broke, it is not working.
0.0	0.442718814377	They shouldn't automatically assume that because you believe that marriage is between one man and one woman that you are a homophobe.
0.0	0.443250629931	Because we can't just save the American Dream, we can expand it to reach more people, and change more lives than ever before.
0.0	0.443295329292	We have to do this in unison with the Arab world.
0.0	0.443870435697	A law has been sitting -- languishing, sadly, on Capitol Hill and has not yet been passed, and it would help.
0.0	0.444028927428	We need a fighter for this country again.
0.0	0.444221221311	I've done it once in Washington, with great jobs and lower taxes.
0.0	0.444221566975	At the end of the day, the legal issue is quite straightforward, but I would note that the birther theories that Donald has been relying on -- some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on U.S. soil, but have two parents born on U.S. soil.
0.0	0.444390833543	I'm not anti-Wall Street, but I don't believe the government ought to wear a team jersey, pick winners and losers.
0.0	0.444412157622	I'm a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.444445422694	They have to come into this country legally.
0.0	0.444550759008	We had a decision to make early on, do we do a Super PAC?
0.0	0.444763692163	You know, I think most people know exactly what New York values are.
0.0	0.444826578502	Well, as you know, I'm a former elected prosecutor, a former elected attorney general, trained at the University of Virginia in constitutional law, and I don't believe in litmus tests except this.
0.0	0.445003612017	I would prevent them lobbying Congress.
0.0	0.445443019205	And I'll tell you what, Donald, you -- you very kindly just a moment ago offered me the V.P.
0.0	0.445489483693	Super PACs are a disaster.
0.0	0.445497119525	We need security.
0.0	0.445547960008	I would hope that we could all agree that we are sick and tired of seeing videos on television of unarmed people, often African-Americans, shot by police officers.
0.0	0.446342150094	Actually a close friend.
0.0	0.446434692694	Look, the -- the simple fact is that my plan actually gives the middle class the greatest break: $2,000 per family.
0.0	0.44648715966	I think it's a good product.
0.0	0.446604751643	It needs to be repealed and replaced.
0.0	0.446659460205	You target the bad guys.
0.0	0.446659774778	I want to tackle those barriers that stand in the way of too many Americans right now.
0.0	0.446872113636	We have this enormous mismatch because we have smaller and smaller families.
0.0	0.446925450879	When you look at raising the debt limit, it should be leverage to try to reform government.
0.0	0.446945632363	They're taking money from Social Security and they're going to spend it on the military and they're going to spend it on domestic spending.
0.0	0.44695923416	People in Washington think they were sent there to be adults and govern and do all this.
0.0	0.447109453344	I think he would have said bring back a 21st-century Glass-Steagall legislation.
0.0	0.447317608635	First of all, Ohio does have an energy industry, but we're diversified.
0.0	0.447606943626	First, we should pass the Expatriate Terrorist Act, legislation I've introduced that says if an American goes and joins ISIS and wages jihad against America, that you forfeit your citizenship and you can not come in on a passport.
0.0	0.447623707986	There was nothing to this birther issue.
0.0	0.447781025824	This is why, fundamentally, we have to take our government back.
0.0	0.447821377581	Every time we send signals like this, we send a signal of weakness, not strength.
0.0	0.448187750349	We're asking the top 1.5 percent, including passive income, to start paying a little bit more so that the elderly and disabled vets in this country can live with security and dignity.

0.0	0.448683827673	I've got one more question for you then.
1.0	0.448889682196	You know, the FBI director, the president's appointed FBI director has said this week that because of a lack of support from politicians like the president of the United States, that police officers are afraid to get out of their cars; that they're afraid to enforce the law.
0.0	0.448983129775	They built the great wall of China.
0.0	0.449061962318	And you think about the reasons that we're having such difficulty right now with our job market.
0.0	0.449201673064	I didn't inherit any money.
0.0	0.449249576105	No radical Islam that is allowed to engage in encouraging violence against Americans, that is not protected speech.
0.0	0.449299541344	We need to begin by undoing -- I would begin by undoing a whole set of things that President Obama has done, whether it's illegal amnesty or this latest round of EPA regulations.
0.0	0.449396270686	Because they're recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees.

0.0	0.450208562564	Those aren't Iowa values, but this is what we believe in New York."
0.0	0.450226303748	It's why you see Walgreens buying Rite Aid.
0.0	0.450343378084	Let me just add one thing about ISIS over there.
0.0	0.450461083892	You're not going to even allow them to come to our country?
0.0	0.450470503378	If I become President because we'll have a Constitutional Amendment to require a federally balanced budget so they will do their job.
0.0	0.450995962144	You know, you had Herbert Hoover before that saying, no, we got to only worry about the deficit.
0.0	0.451237914611	So, we're going to enforce the law, we're going to change policing practices, we're going to change incarceration practices, but we're also going to emphasize education, jobs, and housing.

0.0	0.452192351283	And so that was his explanation.
0.0	0.452355172867	This country is running out of time.
0.0	0.452372046971	That's why I've been leading the fight to stop it.
0.0	0.452561297873	There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies.
0.0	0.452793728794	Yes, they have to stop being the main state sponsor of terrorism.
0.0	0.452851390418	What he said, and he said it in the last debate, it's simply not true.
0.0	0.452875395889	Maria, you look at what this president and his secretary of state, Secretary of State Clinton, has done to get us in this spot.
0.0	0.452895799234	I have seen him appoint people to our courts not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.453076707842	Just like getting rid of Medicare and Medicaid.
0.0	0.453620128551	I far prefer that and the chances we have to be successful there than trying to start all over again, gridlocking our system, and trying to get from zero to 100 percent.
0.0	0.453642181162	Yeah, I would go, first of all, one step further in this description of Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.453665910679	You blindfold the American people so that they cannot see the true cost of government.
0.0	0.453909522144	Do you remember when he ran for president of the United States, and he was a candidate, and he went and said, "These Americans with traditional values, they are bitter people, and they cling to their guns and to their religion."
0.0	0.454132432379	In the crowd today is Major General James Livingston, who's the co-chairman of my campaign here in South Carolina, a Medal of Honor recipient.
0.0	0.454223220443	We have to protect our 2nd amendment and you cannot do this and certainly what Barack Obama was doing with the executive order.
0.0	0.454426468329	This country is changing.
0.0	0.454671585804	You have to ban radical Islamic jihadists.
0.0	0.454860591682	Eleven points, to be exact.
0.0	0.454894648165	It's a private-sector solution that believes in freedom, not Obamacare that believes in government control.
0.0	0.454920952343	They are a sophisticated purveyor of propaganda, a celebrator of violence, an instigator of attacks using their online presence.
0.0	0.455023635422	What you need to do is free up interest rates.
0.0	0.455228227689	In fact, frankly, he's complaining about the fact that we're losing some of the most talented people.
0.0	0.455399991254	My state is doing great across the board.
0.0	0.45545641428	Absolutely, we need to defund Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.455520703083	We have been talking about it for decades.
0.0	0.455620495649	I suspect you may have.
0.0	0.456042245766	If I'm elected president, we will not let in refugees from countries controlled by ISIS or Al Qaida.
0.0	0.456437444769	I propose to reverse that and get this economy moving again.
0.0	0.456509484122	... that's what you say in a primary.
0.0	0.456513619449	As a senator, yes, I was a senator.
0.0	0.456530869555	Until we have a president of the United States that gets up every day and goes to the Oval Office with the intent purpose of securing that border, and there's not anybody on either one of these stages that has the experience of dealing with this as I have for over 14 years with that 1200-mile border.
0.0	0.456552973941	Please do not tell me that in this country, if -- and here's the if -- we have the courage to take on the drug companies, and have the courage to take on the insurance companies, and the medical equipment suppliers, if we do that, yes, we can guarantee health care to all people in a much more cost effective way.
0.0	0.456795428436	And the last line standing between them and our families might be us and a gun.
0.0	0.457201593887	It is Hillary, it is Biden, it is the others who insist on allowing abortion well into viable (inaudible) wrong, and that should be stopped.
0.0	0.457251949016	We're one of the fastest growing states in the country.
0.0	0.457351941103	Kissinger was one of those people during the Vietnam era who talked about the domino theory.
0.0	0.45747310343	And that's why I've offered a specific program to the people of America tonight to address the fundamental problem of getting our country growing again, getting our economy growing, wages up, opportunities for people.
1.0	0.457635371111	Everybody voted for it wanting to see Libya move toward democracy, of course we all wanted to do that.
0.0	0.457670648911	Because seniors, if they are retired, are no longer earning an income from a job.
1.0	0.457796692067	What Hillary Clinton's going to say, and has said before is, she wants to raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.458147611052	If we're gonna reform welfare for poor people, we ought to reform it for rich people, as well.
0.0	0.458261389867	I am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of Vermont from very significant majorities of women.
0.0	0.458818845795	He was the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan.
0.0	0.459006405848	About every two weeks, he holds a press conference talking about how he can't wait to restrict people's access to guns.
0.0	0.459430621984	And yes, the economy is rigged in favor of those at the top.
0.0	0.459626821718	And based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don't add up, and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now.
0.0	0.460199763376	The president of the United States admitting that he's weakening our government's position, our foreign policy standing, because he can't control spending in D.C..
0.0	0.46029374256	Mine is unique in the sense that my tax plan actually gets rid of the payroll tax as well.
0.0	0.460295502157	We do that, this country would be safe and secure again not only from criminals but from the terrorist who threaten us as well.
0.0	0.460694946917	You have a big lawsuit over your head while you're running.
0.0	0.4608726318	At the end of the day, ladies and gentlemen, our best days are ahead of us only if we work together, and I intend to put this country on a path of success by working together and doing the hard things that should have been done a very long time ago.
0.0	0.460939745046	And we're going to eliminate the death tax.
0.0	0.461024085089	Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, they're no better.
0.0	0.461027597263	One principle, for example, we've got to embrace is on immigration.
0.0	0.461130916797	And his explanation -- he said, "look, I'm from New York, that's what we believe in New York.
1.0	0.461235790985	I was not at all critical of him.
0.0	0.461293965109	And I'll note that California senator -- Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said, if she could say to Mr. America and Mrs. America, "give me your guns, I'm rounding them up," she would.
0.0	0.461432698025	America was worth the wait.
0.0	0.461565695219	The chances of any litigation proceeding and succeeding on this are zero.
0.0	0.461639361589	If you look at the numbers, there are actually as many, if not more white communities that are truly being left behind and left out.
0.0	0.461716215791	That's wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country.
0.0	0.462161230531	I was not that candidate.
0.0	0.46225132561	Well, listen, I've spent my entire life defending the Constitution before the U.S. Supreme Court.
0.0	0.462344828567	This is a group of people that enslaves women and sells them, sells them as brides.
0.0	0.462550336569	Does he stand up for law enforcement?
0.0	0.462673178216	The Egyptians have asked us to share intelligence.
0.0	0.462738465166	One of your colleagues interviewed me.
0.0	0.463136033394	I congratulate Secretary of State John Kerry and the president for working on this agreement.
0.0	0.463596484147	Companies should, if they want to attract the best workers, provide a good set of benefits.
0.0	0.464045614002	A terrible sight.
0.0	0.464214605577	You're simply not.
0.0	0.46422330512	Gronkowski is still going strong.
0.0	0.464509891641	We're nowhere close to a balanced budget or fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.464778894184	I'm against the kind of inhumane treatment that is now being visited upon families, waking them up in the middle of the night, rounding them up.
0.0	0.464823600474	It's a -- it's absolutely disgraceful that Secretary Kerry and others said in their response to what's going on in Iran that this was a good thing; it showed how the relationship was getting better.
0.0	0.464993093665	If elected president, I will do everything I can to expand Social Security benefits, not just for seniors, but for disabled veterans, as well.
0.0	0.465250833061	It's one of the biggest problems our country has.
0.0	0.465301094038	But those kinds of personal assessments and charges are ones that I find particularly troubling.
0.0	0.465314273835	We're going to have too many people in the cart rather than pulling the cart.
0.0	0.465377901327	And so much of what we did -- to force competition, to use technology, to stand down the special interest groups -- can you imagine taking Medicaid from 10 to 2.5 percent?
0.0	0.465408776357	Let me just say on taxes, how long have we been talking about tax reform in Washington, D.C.?
0.0	0.465486026313	I would change them.
0.0	0.465558667267	The worker's out of a job.
0.0	0.46564467894	And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, because I've been a leader on these issues.
0.0	0.465787523867	We have gutted our ability to detect the next attack.
0.0	0.465806866846	The fact is, in order to get this economy moving again, I call for freezing regulations for a year except for the problem of public safety.
0.0	0.466111076154	When I was 21, my mom died.
0.0	0.466161082191	The only way we're going to defund Planned Parenthood is have a pro-life president.
0.0	0.466276429279	You had only 21 Republican governors in this country.
0.0	0.466279761756	If you do that, you don't just change the economy, you transform the lives of millions of hurting Americans.
0.0	0.466475357244	And worse -- worse yet, to be honest with you, Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster.
0.0	0.466933390385	I'm the only one on this stage who has a plan that's actually reduced -- actually going to reduce immigration.
0.0	0.466981558541	Simplifying the code and lowering rates, both for corporations and -- and personal rates, is exactly what we need to do.
0.0	0.467157037691	They order planes, they make Boeing build their plant in China.
0.0	0.467159277918	I am the only person in either campaign that's self-funding.
0.0	0.467218401447	And then in addition to that, the American people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.467625212253	And I would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country.
0.0	0.467681881477	We differ, however, on a couple of key points.
0.0	0.467694370142	So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.467722323467	And, you know, for six-and-a-half years, we've had a gigantic party.
0.0	0.467951660303	It was LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations in this country.
0.0	0.468173357104	And for 30 years, the issue of immigration has been about someone who's in this country, maybe they're here illegally, but they're looking for a job.
0.0	0.468474732756	I don't know if any of us could have done what they did, one after another, within 48 hours of that tragedy taking place.
0.0	0.468515874541	The president's first impulse is do this by executive order, power he doesn't have.
0.0	0.468688041045	Do I take the product?
0.0	0.46882786524	We are looking at an economy in which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.
0.0	0.468896369572	You didn't see these kind of ideas being batted around, and being batted around in a way that's civil and smart and that's trying to help to inform the voter out there.
0.0	0.469027462431	How can you run for the Republican nomination and be for single- payer health care?
0.0	0.469060773769	It will end on January 2017.
0.0	0.469165072473	The the truth of the matter is, big government benefits the wealthy, it benefits the lobbyists, it benefits the giant corporations.
0.0	0.469203911021	I'm the only one on this stage that has a plan that would create jobs, cut taxes, balance the budget and can get it done because I'm realistic.
0.0	0.469327215797	And believe me, Assad is not worth it.
0.0	0.469387603789	You know, we could give you another example -- the Marines, the Army, these wonderful six soldiers that were killed.
0.0	0.469392779486	There is no other description of it.
1.0	0.469429424924	Median wages have stagnated.
0.0	0.469443578492	We're going to do a tax cut for all Americans.
0.0	0.469783771999	Doesn't hurt rich people if their bar of soap goes up ten cents, but it hurts the poor and the middle class.
0.0	0.469805621766	Corporate inversion is one of the biggest problems we have.
0.0	0.469855286959	I think there's a sense in this country today that somehow our best days are behind us.
0.0	0.46992570218	We are nineteen trillion dollars -- our country's a mess and we can't let all these people come into our country and break our borders.
0.0	0.469964047343	It's all about getting people to listen to one another's problems.
0.0	0.470036226706	Every election we talk about Medicare and Social Security reform.
0.0	0.470261455027	I was a child of Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.470521948991	There is a radical jihadist group that is manipulating our immigration system.
0.0	0.470653550156	Someone's going to be collecting this tax.
0.0	0.47125511069	He wasn't my senator.
0.0	0.471366412871	And they will work with me to get comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.471383344944	Last I heard we lived in a democratic society.
0.0	0.47162157486	...numerically, it's gonna be higher.
0.0	0.471635890355	And they got a killer in San Bernardino in posing as a fiance.
0.0	0.471657266424	And she and I looked at the same evidence coming from the Bush administration regarding Iraq.
0.0	0.47170372097	The question was, would you meet with an adversary without conditions?
0.0	0.472045012649	And that's what I intend to do.
0.0	0.472460446703	That never works.
0.0	0.472957314514	We're bringing corporate taxes down, bringing money back in, corporate inversions.
0.0	0.473082136265	You have small businesses in America that are struggling.
0.0	0.473316876981	That's fine.
0.0	0.473316876981	That's fine.
0.0	0.473371398845	I do not believe a vote in 2002 is a plan to defeat ISIS in 2016.
0.0	0.473405332417	... put us on firm ground, and has sent us into the future.
0.0	0.473726131811	I had to answer every single question about every single result and every single projection in public until there were no more questions.
0.0	0.474168404949	Growth is the answer.
0.0	0.474468555983	I would take the fight to these guys, whatever it took, as long as it took.
0.0	0.474942867664	The simple fact is that the plane that's being build here is being sold to China.
0.0	0.474974189859	My name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.475507106019	Listen, we -- this is the greatest country in the history of mankind.
0.0	0.476142120013	This president allows lawlessness throughout this country.
0.0	0.476167643723	Here's my promise, at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country.
0.0	0.476219979872	The business flat tax, they already impose their taxes on us, so there's no reciprocal...
0.0	0.476297053168	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.476848637259	It's not constitutional.
0.0	0.476914336493	In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense.
0.0	0.476950081819	But many, many people did.
0.0	0.477129194088	Now, since September, the Constitution hasn't changed.
0.0	0.477188870516	They have a sophisticated understanding of our legal immigration system and we now have an obligation to ensure that they are not able to use that system against us.
0.0	0.477810081272	And said, well, she said you were angry and I said to myself, huh, she's right.
0.0	0.477832653521	So why are the pharmaceutical companies consolidating?
0.0	0.477884212725	You looking at me?
0.0	0.477894109863	And with respect to the 2007 bill, this was Ted Kennedy's bill.
0.0	0.477900017805	No, I oppose it because you're taking money from the entitlement and then spending it immediately on other items.
0.0	0.478053094841	So many companies are going to leave our country.
0.0	0.478338670079	I recommended that the president go forward.
0.0	0.478773673034	But a great nation like ours should not be in a position where elderly people are cutting their pills in half, where they don't have decent nutrition, where they can't heat their homes in the wintertime.
0.0	0.479032497468	Because the more you tax something, the less of it you get.
0.0	0.479248378875	So, I'm proud of Senator Sanders, and his supporters.
0.0	0.479643069353	What I did in New York was bring people together, an overwhelmingly Democratic state.
0.0	0.480056395214	And the people of New Jersey, I've seen it.
0.0	0.480229881978	And every single income decile sees a double-digit increase in after-tax income.
0.0	0.480244857385	We can do a wall.
0.0	0.48039807418	So, yes, I do believe that when we talk about public education in America, today, in a rapidly changing world, we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities.
0.0	0.480632695266	And we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid.
0.0	0.480953842384	I mean, so don't -- so you can't -- you can't...
0.0	0.481118933992	And I spent my entire lifetime balancing federal budgets, growing jobs, the same in Ohio.
0.0	0.481191827676	Not just the hacking of OPM, but that is -- that is just shameful.
0.0	0.481382013347	Well, first of all, I'm 7 and 0 in my fantasy league.
0.0	0.481506851817	You have regulations -- I mean, come on, they're affecting everybody here, particularly our small businesses.
0.0	0.481627063172	It's a problem all over the world.
0.0	0.482002438651	The second thing I said is we need to add reforms, not just increase the numbers, but add reforms.
0.0	0.482117739692	We cannot be the world's policeman.
0.0	0.482717716169	So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States.
0.0	0.483235335166	And we have to take properly vetted refugees ourselves.
0.0	0.483242868458	I came to Washington, D.C. in 1990.
0.0	0.483286374193	We both agree that we have to get unaccountable money out of our political system and that we have to do much more to ensure that Wall Street never wrecks main street again.
0.0	0.483390639634	We are lowering taxes on small business.
0.0	0.48373160956	Nothing has to change for current beneficiaries.
0.0	0.48379086478	And then, after the war, this is the guy who, in fact, yes, you're right, he opened up relations with China, and now pushed various type of trade agreements, resulting in American workers losing their jobs as corporations moved to China.
0.0	0.484062606596	It's Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.484115244635	And so everybody needs to discount some of the things you're going to hear in these ads, and discount the -- the back-and-forth here, because every person here is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.484149855968	Secondly, I certainly support that we need to tear down cyber walls, not on a mass basis, but on a targeted basis.
0.0	0.484210869091	-- at least half of the things Marco said are flat-out false.
0.0	0.484235236245	I've a bill to fix Social Security.
0.0	0.484496632005	They're absolutely false.
0.0	0.484621007724	Why in God's name does Wall Street make huge campaign contributions?
0.0	0.484640458699	I believe in government, but I believe in efficient government, not wasteful government.
0.0	0.484674146148	Two points.
0.0	0.484774153446	So conservatives actually do come out of Manhattan, including William F. Buckley and others, just so you understand.
0.0	0.484836989539	He has gone to China.
0.0	0.484852584972	They've contacted the trafficking networks in the Western Hemisphere to get people in through the southern border.
0.0	0.48511372679	You know what he said to me?
0.0	0.485149691339	And I've done it in the state of Ohio as the chief executive.
0.0	0.485167815268	One of them is a statewide use of deadly force.
0.0	0.485513186974	It's the New York Times, they are always wrong.
