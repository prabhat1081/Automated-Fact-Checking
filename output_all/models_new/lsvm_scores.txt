0.0	0.0557620339983	And when you do that, you will be amazed at how much progress you can make, and how much healing we can have.
0.0	0.0661443017068	... the fact is, Neil, let's think about -- let's think about -- and I want to maybe -- I hope the president is watching tonight, because here's what I'd like to tell him.
0.0	0.0809971704654	You know, you look at what's going on, you see all the divisiveness and the hatred that goes on in our society.
0.0	0.0860888853646	And, for those of us who are serious enough to run for president, think long and hard why we're here, and hopefully you'll know we're not here for ourselves.
0.0	0.0969569948648	And guess what?
0.0	0.0982743713738	I think America can only live up to its potential when we make sure that every American has a chance to live up to his or her potential.
0.0	0.0997495420331	The contrast with the Democratic debate, where every fawning question from the media was, "Which of you is more handsome and why?"
0.0	0.104664383958	How do we decide on who gets to follow up?
0.0	0.112739343729	And how do I know it?
0.0	0.112899953439	I think we need to do a lot more than we're doing.
0.0	0.115051137838	And if you really want to believe that you can get your voice back, I will tell you, as I have all my career, I will continue to fight for you, because you're the ones that built this country, and will carry it into the future.
0.0	0.11506373129	I'm happy to have him tonight...
0.0	0.115636562051	And who can blame them?
0.0	0.116952717053	I want to use that same up here, whatever it may be to make America rich again and to make America great again.
0.0	0.119333897919	Well, when you look at the celebrity of Donald Trump, then I think that says a lot about it.
0.0	0.120510324388	Well, first of all, let's understand why we are even having this debate and why Donald tapped in to some of that anger that's out there about this whole issue.
0.0	0.122210221879	Oh yeah, we want to elect a good president, but America is great from the bottom-up, and the bottom-up is us in our families, in our communities, in our neighborhoods.
0.0	0.12338713819	How great is that?
0.0	0.124365158868	Let's hope that it holds.
0.0	0.125195729641	It feels different.
0.0	0.126623909723	When -- when we put all the facts down, you'll be able to see that it's not true, it works out very well.
0.0	0.127497658501	Because if you are, you need to elect someone who's deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.128037004419	If we do not know who you are, and we do not know why you are coming when I am president, you are not getting into the United States of America.
0.0	0.128243634986	With all the candidates, why me?
0.0	0.128882998475	But I look at this country today, and I look at how divided we are, I look at how politicians are always posturing and issuing sound bites but never solving problems.
0.0	0.134562928566	Wait for what?
0.0	0.135298926649	Look, I think we are readier than we used to be, but it's a constant effort that has to be undertaken to make sure we are as ready as we need to be.
0.0	0.135349680654	I understand.
0.0	0.135875115843	That's what I think we need to do.
0.0	0.13591516853	I know how to do that.
0.0	0.136186238887	And that's why, as president, I will look at communities that need special help and try to deliver that.
0.0	0.136983524337	I think to be commander in chief in the 21st century requires someone who understands how the economy works, someone who understands how the world works and who's in it; I know more world leaders on the stage today than anyone running, with the possible exception of Hillary Clinton; understands bureaucracies, how to cut them down to size and hold them accountable; and understands technology, which is a tool, but it's also a weapon that's being used against us.
0.0	0.13712549772	..."diabetes, heart disease, cancer and Alzheimer's?"
0.0	0.137893003119	... and I'll tell you why.
0.0	0.138526186974	That's what they do, whether it's the San Bernardino attack or if it's these tragedies that take place, I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is.
0.0	0.139292237074	I would like to take a hard look at every part of the federal government and really do the kind of analysis that would rebuild some confidence in people that we're taking a hard look about what we have, you know, and what we don't need anymore.
0.0	0.139556302022	How do I know this?
0.0	0.139811411246	But furthermore, what we have got to do, I'm sorry, yes, I do believe that we have got to do everything that we can, and it will not happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.140366282362	We need to elect someone who will stand with the American people, who understands its greatness, who understands what an open economy and freedom is all about, but at the same time, has a record of being able to get things done in Washington like we've never seen before.
0.0	0.14087540274	I'm aware of that.
0.0	0.141278899087	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.142556802922	What are the rules on who gets to follow up.
0.0	0.143257369061	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.143658852459	We need a unifier, not a cynical divider in chief, and that's exactly what I will do.
0.0	0.14388026274	I'm the only guy on this stage -- you know, everybody has an "only guy" -- "I'm the only guy this; I'm the only guy that."
0.0	0.144203191164	And if you become the nominee, who the hell knows if you can even serve in office?
0.0	0.144426863594	I frankly don't think there will be much change because I think what's going to happen is you're going to get more of the same.
0.0	0.145529732927	Yes, I might feel more comfortable.
0.0	0.146809418339	And, I also just want to thank the audience for being attentive, and noticing the questions, and the noticing the answers.
0.0	0.147369762086	We need to know who our neighbors are.
0.0	0.147379998744	We're going to make a really dynamic economy from what we have right now, which is not at all dynamic.
0.0	0.148126545715	And that's what this economy needs to -- that's what this debate needs to be about.
0.0	0.148646115353	I would hope that you would come onboard and say that this is the simple and straightforward thing to do.
0.0	0.148939557959	And Mexico's going to pay for the wall because Mexico -- I love the Mexican people; I respect the Mexican leaders -- but the leaders are much sharper, smarter and more cunning than our leaders.
0.0	0.149320902261	Good luck making something out of this mess."
0.0	0.149745528175	I think we need to be very careful with tariffs, and here's why.
0.0	0.150437648207	Do you remember that, everybody?
0.0	0.152892614151	Next, we have to talk to our adversaries, and we have to make sure they understand the limits of our patience.
0.0	0.153308002527	When I think about the folks who are out there at home tonight watching, and I think about what they had to watch this week -- the spectacle they had to watch on the floor of the House of Representatives, with the president of the United States, who talked a fantasy land about the way they're feeling.
0.0	0.153734426921	But I like to be unpredictable so that people don't know exactly... (LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.153873364881	And, thank you everybody.
0.0	0.153949515013	But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work.
0.0	0.15426931233	I think he's tapped into an anger that people feel.
0.0	0.154752483115	And we need to very, very concerned about that.
0.0	0.155705689919	Divisive and with no vision.
0.0	0.155879002876	I know we have a president who wants to do whatever he wants to do, and take his pen and his phone and just tell everybody what he thinks is best.
0.0	0.157480029472	...Chris...
0.0	0.157480029472	...Chris...
0.0	0.157965035392	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.158412017948	I think the times are much more serious.
0.0	0.158839803798	I think we should do both.
0.0	0.159165245324	There have been some good recommendations about what needs to happen.
0.0	0.159692320582	And I could say, oh, I'm not angry.
0.0	0.159737678437	Let people play, who cares?
0.0	0.159772621605	You know I understand why Donald made the comments he did and I understand why Americans are feeling frustrated and scared and angry when we have a president who refuses to acknowledge the threat we face and even worse, who acts as an apologist for radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.160532628557	I will not shock anybody to suggest that in politics there is occasionally a little bit of hypocrisy.
0.0	0.160632071055	Liberty thrives when government is small.
0.0	0.161312514929	I think what President Obama did was to exemplify the importance of this issue as our first African American president, and to address it both from the President's office, and through his advocacy, such as working with young men, and Mrs. Obama's work with young women.
0.0	0.162172519942	You know, frankly, I did it in Washington, in Ohio, and I will do it again in Washington, if I'm president, to get this country moving again.
0.0	0.162197152769	You know why?
0.0	0.162197152769	You know why?
0.0	0.162980674606	Because now he's going a little bit better.
0.0	0.163088831128	So we need to get on a different mindset.
0.0	0.163347063738	So, we have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.164072081944	And I think together we will make progress.
0.0	0.164123556784	You've got to have a clear vision of where you want to go.
0.0	0.164393814158	So I'm doing great.
0.0	0.164523186426	I think that sets us apart from a lot of what's happening right now on the Republican side.
0.0	0.164583754103	And, PBS, thank you.
0.0	0.165352608291	But let's be clear: Russia's aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO -- correctly, I believe -- are saying, you know what, we're going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action.
0.0	0.165656670487	I think you're --
0.0	0.165799244572	But I know who the pessimist is.
0.0	0.165824039757	Maria, Neil, thank you for a great debate tonight.
0.0	0.166164480954	Think about it.
0.0	0.166164480954	Think about it.
0.0	0.166512501117	I am passionate about what I believe.
0.0	0.167518834288	So if we want to pick and choose -- and I certainly do -- people I listen to, people I don't listen to, people I listen to for certain areas, then I think we have to be fair and look at the entire world, because it's a big, complicated world out there.
0.0	0.167797930836	Let me translate that for you.
0.0	0.167850248345	So I'm going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of Americans fulfilling their potential, because I don't think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single American to live up to theirs.
0.0	0.168286107093	So whether it's green cards or any other form of entry into America, when I'm president if we do not know who you are or why you are coming, you are not going to get into the United States of America.
0.0	0.168312999696	They need to learn English, adopt our values, roll up their sleeves and get to work.
0.0	0.16852366207	But they need to see leadership, support and resolve from the United States of America, and we can help them defeat ISIS.
0.0	0.168940714842	Number -- and that is important for you to know.
0.0	0.169255973923	Not everybody remembers that.
0.0	0.17000946509	But my wife is down here in the front, and I'm sure, if you'd like to talk to her later, she can give you more than you'll ever be able to take care of.
0.0	0.17030433827	But the issue for us is to have a Congress that stands up and says not only no, but "Hell no" to this money going to a regime that is going to use it for terror, Susan Rice has said that, and we need to stand up and strongly and clearly tell the ayatollah that -- whoever the next president of the United States is going to be, and I'll promise you, if it's me, the first thing that I will do is tear up that agreement with Iran.
0.0	0.171059357398	I want a government so small that the individual has a chance to thrive and prosper.
0.0	0.171400522763	... stirs up the demagoguery against American Muslims, that hurts us at home.
0.0	0.171654377988	And when you do that, when you're in a position of managing regulations; when you reduce taxes; and when you have fiscal discipline, you see the job creators begin to get very comfortable with the fact that they can invest.
0.0	0.171890282027	That is who I'm fighting for.
0.0	0.173101609934	I'll tell you how optimistic I am about America.
0.0	0.173493970636	We hear actually a lot of good intentions.
0.0	0.173749041147	That's what I'm working towards.
0.0	0.173787994317	We hear a lot of good plans.
0.0	0.174168187155	I want to be in -- I want America to be the best...
0.0	0.174568609061	And that's why I think these ideas up here are great, and that's what we should have is have more discussions like this and less gotcha.
0.0	0.174845837133	Play by the rules.
0.0	0.175058509291	And I think the focus ought to be on making sure that we leave this nomination process, as wild and woolly as it's going to be -- this is not being bad.
0.0	0.175189746367	And when I look at Washington today, we need to bring us together.
0.0	0.175273892998	Because when government gets big and powerful, the big feel like they need to get even bigger to deal with all that power, and meanwhile, the small and the powerless -- in this case, 1,590 community banks -- go out of business.
0.0	0.175988990457	Gosh, I'd love for us to talk about something like that.
0.0	0.176689184074	Somebody says "I'm a fighter."
0.0	0.176751310687	But if you want someone to drive you home, I will get the job done and I will get you home.
0.0	0.176874131096	We elected someone as president who wants to change America, who wants to make it more like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.177008023003	So I just truly, with all my heart belief, I like everybody on the stage.
0.0	0.177488531189	HEMMER: Wow.
0.0	0.177586808702	Everybody knows that.
0.0	0.1787289133	So you know what needs to happen, it's a very simple equation, and it's going to happen when I'm president.
0.0	0.178912126663	I don't see a lot of weakness on this stage, quite frankly.
0.0	0.179096294298	But here's the point I want to make tonight.
0.0	0.179299904818	And I do carry on occasion, sometimes a lot.
0.0	0.180014300751	But I -- the struggle of single moms is extraordinary.
0.0	0.180157478416	And they say down as a group trying to make sure that we can begin to heal some of these problems that we see between community and police.
0.0	0.180258700017	Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point?
0.0	0.180709356945	Maria...
0.0	0.180735160751	It could be people that are going to do great, great destruction.
0.0	0.18077305815	Yeah.
0.0	0.18077305815	Yeah.
0.0	0.180820305926	Think about that.
0.0	0.180946428051	Secondly, a policy on recruiting and hiring, and then more resources for -- for training.
0.0	0.181186466508	And we are not England.
0.0	0.181251998417	They know.
0.0	0.181781254759	...Thank you.
0.0	0.182163682508	We need to tell folks who want to come here, they need to come here legally.
0.0	0.182725520102	Now, what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next.
0.0	0.183012495135	I will do that.
0.0	0.183757981424	... who got us out of that...
0.0	0.183802114765	And I will tell you something that really galls me.
0.0	0.183828396178	We are all frustrated with what China is doing.
0.0	0.184332074404	And I'm not blaming these folks -- but I guess I could.
0.0	0.184876402676	Well, to start with, unlike President Obama, I'll actually name the enemy that we confront.
0.0	0.185125830397	(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
0.0	0.185238708739	And he stood before the American people and he said, "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself," a profound statement that gave the American people the courage to believe that, yes, we could get out of that terrible depression.
0.0	0.185661083213	So we need new leadership -- yes.
0.0	0.18593696144	Neil...
0.0	0.186614169983	But the real -- but I think we have to get back to what this election has to be about.
0.0	0.186685534193	I think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether it's poison in the water of the children of Flint, or whether it's the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the LGBT community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, that's what I want to take on.
0.0	0.186710001238	And for the life of me, I have no understanding why the president thinks that everything is going well.
0.0	0.187001714349	America's at a crossroads.
0.0	0.187439085823	(LAUGHTER) I'll tell you what.
0.0	0.187487944965	As we speak, there are new problems on the horizon.
0.0	0.187496744507	And -- and I guess I can -- can frame it another way.
0.0	0.18780928529	What else we can do is that we should believe in science.
0.0	0.187912587383	This is a humanitarian catastrophe.
0.0	0.188131400452	Okay.
0.0	0.188852096416	I will do that in Washington.
0.0	0.190014947405	That's for sure.
0.0	0.190057432744	This is about people's lives, and we should level with the American people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare.
0.0	0.190191957847	What we need to do is destroy their ability to attack us here over there, and then get out.
0.0	0.190510542228	And we got to fight like crazy so people can think the American dream still exists, because it does, with rising wages, with full employment and with everybody in America -- and I mean everybody in America -- having an opportunity to realize the American dream of having a better life than their mother and their father.
0.0	0.190543433952	Well, John, I don't really have any weaknesses that I can think of.
0.0	0.190624261753	I'm happy to answer the question...
0.0	0.190874324789	And for good cause.
0.0	0.191598292913	And I think this has become something that needs to be looked at in terms of regulation.
0.0	0.191858378608	I've lived my whole life fighting -- fighting for things that I believe in, fighting for justice and to protect people from crime and terrorism, fighting to stand up for folks who have not had enough and need an opportunity to get more, and to stand up and fight against the special interests.
0.0	0.191971750876	And, we come out here, and we do our thing.
0.0	0.192021409533	And they must be part of our coalition to destroy ISIS and I believe we can get that done.
0.0	0.19204173367	I'll talk to them.
0.0	0.192060053441	So, I think gun-free zones are a catastrophe.
0.0	0.19240007083	You see, because if you really want to get to a balanced budget, you need to reduce your expenses and you need to grow your economy.
0.0	0.192438772952	You know that.
0.0	0.192602323936	I think it is fair to say, whatever the complaints that you want to make about him are, that with respect to China, one of the most challenging relationships we have, his opening up China and his ongoing relationships with the leaders of China is an incredibly useful relationship for the United States of America.
0.0	0.192653988786	And, you look at the questions -- "Donald Trump, are you a comic-book villain?"
0.0	0.192747613547	Everybody is really doing some bad fact...
0.0	0.192858758515	It has to be based on what skills you have, what you can contribute economically, and most important of all, on whether or not you're coming here to become an American, not just live in America, but be an American.
0.0	0.193004883602	And they wonder whether somebody is getting something to -- keeping them from getting it.
0.0	0.193048426909	And you can go get it at jeb2016.com.
0.0	0.193107719791	I want to speak to all our fighting men and women.
0.0	0.193291326802	And that's why we have to use Carl (ph) and we have to use our great businesspeople and not political hacks to negotiate with these guys.
0.0	0.193574563305	And I'm glad that I have a chance to answer this question.
0.0	0.193807675119	... he's really doing some bad...
0.0	0.194253862331	But we need to understand that American Muslims are on the front line of our defense.
0.0	0.194613550592	Just know where you want to go, stick to your guts.
0.0	0.194880901003	She was naturalized.
0.0	0.194961989641	I will continue to have tremendous admiration and respect for Governor Bush.
0.0	0.195089949999	In fact, we need to -- wait a minute -- we need vigilance.
0.0	0.19541813655	So let's start -- let's start with immigration.
0.0	0.195852458023	-- the issue is who is going to get it done.
0.0	0.196106274621	They will -- some will follow.
0.0	0.196111512689	That's what I've done in Louisiana, that's what I'll do in America.
0.0	0.196292066832	But I want to go further.
0.0	0.196387154746	So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives.
0.0	0.196654865063	And with your vote and your support and your prayers, I will lead with the citizens of this great nation the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.196683720474	By the way, unlike our country where we're totally predictable and the enemy, whether it's ISIS or anybody else, they know exactly what we're doing because we have the wrong leadership.
0.0	0.196736264208	Well, sure.
0.0	0.196905532297	If people are promising they're going to take on Washington and cronyism, you need to look to who has been doing it.
0.0	0.197016496402	There's something going on and it's bad.
0.0	0.197323457145	The truth is this, the big problem, we need a leader in Washington who understands how to get something done, not to talk about it, not to propose it, to get it done.
0.0	0.197469139929	I will not do that.
0.0	0.197579409801	They do whatever what they do, OK.
0.0	0.19758194788	Listen, I want to just comment.
0.0	0.197642951654	I would like to start with a basic.
0.0	0.197665169422	We have to be honest about it.
0.0	0.197838767188	We have a tremendous problem.
0.0	0.19790005338	OK, good.
0.0	0.198042312536	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.198042312536	But I will be putting -- I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
0.0	0.198202584173	See?
1.0	0.198236369259	Well, there's not question that we should be able to look at past president whether they're married to somebody who's running for president or not in terms of their past behavior and what it means.
0.0	0.198339510874	And -- and I just want to take this opportunity to say, you know, in the 2012 election, you know, we -- and when I say we, Republicans -- tore themselves apart.
0.0	0.198405972952	People are waking up because it is going to be us who will determine the direction of our country.
0.0	0.198436945883	Well, Maria, I'm glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what's going on in the world.
0.0	0.198445837118	I'm going to do it for America.
0.0	0.198528558638	But we have a serious problem.
0.0	0.198591420154	You can have him.
0.0	0.198634517466	I'm too agreeable, easy going.
0.0	0.198809871031	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.198852505468	You ought to just be able to get over it, get used to it...
0.0	0.199020110852	Why weren't they vigilant?
0.0	0.19911830939	It's time for real substance and real experience.
0.0	0.199382647346	But the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, it's to understand what happens the day after.
0.0	0.200443222523	I'm tired of seeing what's going on, between the border where the people flow over; people come in; they live; they shoot.
0.0	0.200609848009	I mean, Chris will know about that.
0.0	0.200850451886	You've got a bit of experience, I would imagine.
0.0	0.201116547584	in particular.
0.0	0.201283823118	Thank you.
0.0	0.201283823118	Thank you.
0.0	0.201283823118	Thank you.
0.0	0.201283823118	Thank you.
0.0	0.201283823118	Thank you.
0.0	0.201283823118	Thank you.
0.0	0.201283823118	Thank you.
0.0	0.201283823118	Thank you.
0.0	0.201283823118	Thank you.
0.0	0.201283823118	Thank you.
0.0	0.201283823118	Thank you.
0.0	0.201283823118	Thank you.
0.0	0.201283823118	Thank you.
0.0	0.201283823118	Thank you.
0.0	0.201283823118	Thank you.
0.0	0.201283823118	Thank you.
0.0	0.201570245246	It's time for us to stand up for what we believe in.
0.0	0.201603880571	He got lucky with fracking.
0.0	0.201972456499	Get it done, because our -- our children and grandchildren are counting on us to get it done.
0.0	0.202190646302	We're going dark when it comes to detecting the next attack.
0.0	0.20226451111	Alright.
0.0	0.20234426391	It's good to be with you.
0.0	0.202480774234	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you had better get rid of the super PACs, because they're causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that are being made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.203624872754	Appreciate it.
0.0	0.203871767845	Actually, I'd love to get you to build a wall.
0.0	0.204199129778	Well, I would really appreciate that.
0.0	0.204263746872	What we have to start thinking about, as leaders, particularly in government, is what can we do for the average American?
0.0	0.204336733376	You know, I -- my -- my mother taught me this.
0.0	0.204385152682	For once, let's do that, and stop trying to give them some kind of fantasy that's never going to come true.
0.0	0.204438313906	We're going to fight it as hard as we can, and we're going to fight whoever the Republicans nominate who will depend on the Koch Brothers, and others.
0.0	0.204571210641	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.204571210641	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.204571210641	(LAUGHTER)
0.0	0.204607414147	And I'm not blaming these folks -- well, I guess I could.
0.0	0.204809214798	I was a banker and I was proud of it.
0.0	0.205163678452	I can.
0.0	0.205333776392	We have a serious problem with, as you know, with radical Islam.
0.0	0.205408428777	Most importantly, I think I understand leadership, which sometimes requires a tough call in a tough time.
0.0	0.205429479187	I'm a fighter.
0.0	0.205483059229	And, you know, we have a whole variety of things that they can do and they can do these things simultaneously.
0.0	0.205682746405	And listen, there are many, many wonderful, wonderful working men and women in the state of New York.
0.0	0.205857601762	I like that.
0.0	0.205917832061	You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.
0.0	0.206215233089	I think he is right.
0.0	0.206263707737	Now Maria, listen.
0.0	0.20630658648	I want to take off from that point and argue the same thing.
0.0	0.206334898879	If i were the president of the United States, I would go and look at every executive order that exists right now and determine which ones want to be voided, because the president shouldn't be legislating: not through that vehicle or any other.
0.0	0.206369347653	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.206369347653	The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.
0.0	0.206479949626	So we have a disagreement on this.
0.0	0.206601265808	Well, I want to know, did you win?
0.0	0.206642303815	I want to -- before my time runs out I want to get back to this issue of ISIS versus Iran.
0.0	0.206703047559	He does great.
0.0	0.207697823082	And wherever you are sitting Nikki, I'm a friend.
0.0	0.207775511416	Crony capitalism is what happens when government gets so big and so powerful that only the big and the powerful can handle it.
0.0	0.207838146617	He's a good guy, a smart guy, and he would be a heck of a lot better president than Hillary Rodham Clinton would ever be.
0.0	0.207842422473	We have a lot of work to do.
0.0	0.207855932138	So let's support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition.
0.0	0.208511773597	I think you do have a humanitarian tragedy there, as I mentioned a moment ago.
0.0	0.208928402198	And God bless America.
0.0	0.209258029268	But the key thing that we're seeing now is serious challenges to this country that must change, the direction of this nation must change.
0.0	0.209397888036	Let's start with immigration and have a little bit of clarity.
0.0	0.210006644209	...and be held accountable.
0.0	0.210041357349	I think he would have been right.
0.0	0.210055746314	Well I want to comment on this.
0.0	0.210242076128	And when they let me down, if they let me down, I never forgive.
0.0	0.210293501506	We need a doer, not a talker.
0.0	0.210662760781	And I'll tell you what a weakness is of this country: there are a lot of people who are sick and tired because Washington does not play by the same rules that the American people have to play by.
0.0	0.210704216799	I'm very proud.
0.0	0.210976661586	... and I know Bernie, and I can promise you he's not going to be president of the United States.
0.0	0.211079612293	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.211079612293	I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.
0.0	0.211323256331	And if I am elected president, to every soldier and sailor and airman and marine, and to every police officer and firefighter and first responder who risk their lives to keep us safe, I will have your back.
0.0	0.211576556212	Yes, in my view, the government of a democratic society has a moral responsibility to play a vital role in making sure all of our people have a decent standard of living.
0.0	0.211727087272	Well, let me -- let me first of all talk a little bit about my experience.
0.0	0.211775188432	We need to come together as a country because we have to realize that America is great, not from the top-down.
0.0	0.211868853903	That's what we need.
0.0	0.211920549822	Well, first of all, thank you all for having us.
0.0	0.211945183814	And that's why we must make sure we continue to frack.
0.0	0.211995680513	I do, however, believe in Reagan's 11th commandment, and will not be engaging in awful things about my compatriots here.
0.0	0.212156285355	Now, Bill, he loves to criticize America, apologize for us, criticize medieval Christians.
0.0	0.212593996621	Divide that out.
0.0	0.21278263345	I know this, I certainly am.
0.0	0.212802638065	... and sign an agreement that makes sure that the world knows that they will have technological superiority.
0.0	0.212888736618	But if you want someone who has a proven, effective leadership, that was a governor of a state, that transformed the culture there, elect me so I can fight for the American people and change the culture in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.213182519112	I love the Chinese people but they laugh themselves, they can't believe how stupid the American leadership is.
0.0	0.213202560922	We know this for a fact.
0.0	0.213219483579	I can do that.
0.0	0.213313194192	And I have many great Muslim friends.
0.0	0.213378192168	Neil, the problem...
0.0	0.213512907548	But look...
0.0	0.214038626868	And, folks, we will.
0.0	0.21406553213	But if we elect the right person -- if you elect me -- we will turn this country around, we will reclaim the American dream and this nation will be stronger and greater than it has ever been.
0.0	0.214220501423	And I make a lot more than the average American.
0.0	0.214366553672	I don't know where you...
0.0	0.214584157644	I know a lot of Americans are angry about the economy.
0.0	0.215178707726	How can we beat an enemy if our commander-in-chief doesn't have the moral honesty and clarity to say that Islam has a problem, and that problem is radical Islam, to say they've got to condemn not generic acts of violence, but the individual murderers who are committing these acts of violence.
0.0	0.215335784255	Makes it a whole lot easier for them to want to go somewhere else.
0.0	0.215414843525	Whatever it takes, as long as it takes, to defeat them.
0.0	0.215511750335	I'm going to do what it takes to defend this nation.
0.0	0.21559851162	In all due respect...
0.0	0.21576877572	We need a leader who will lead the resurgence of this great nation and unlock its potential once again.
0.0	0.216022894387	That will be my mission as president.
0.0	0.216189179998	But I think I'll go back to building buildings if it doesn't work out.
0.0	0.216256552966	And you know, he's right.
0.0	0.216374900948	Such a nasty -- such a nasty question, but thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.216413241214	I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.
0.0	0.216613619627	He has got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.217366758914	Well, I'm glad you asked that, Maria.
0.0	0.217794828633	Make our police officers proud of what they do but more important than that, let them know how proud we are of them."
0.0	0.217882274258	Let me start -- I want to get to the substance of the question on jobs, but I want to start with something.
0.0	0.217910393841	And I believe that the best way to do that is to be aggressive, to be principled, but to have the goal of trying to improve relations.
0.0	0.218012974066	This is what's going on.
0.0	0.218157412507	And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you better get rid of the SuperPacs because they causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that have been made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.
0.0	0.218188920104	And I believe people need a leader who is prepared to make tough calls in tough times and stand up...
0.0	0.218217502887	I think if it doesn't...
0.0	0.218269585629	Hardworking immigrant families living in fear, who should be brought out of the shadows so they and their children can have a better future.
0.0	0.218378516967	CRUZL But I will say --
0.0	0.218423796123	I think it's -- yeah, I think it's a one-two punch.
0.0	0.218490200581	Some do, but many Americans are dying to have an opportunity to grow and to create something inside this economy.
0.0	0.21856176433	But, by the way, when it comes to a woman having to make a very personal choice, ah, in that case, my Republican colleagues love the government and want the government to make that choice for every woman in America.
0.0	0.218723299341	So what if children are going hungry?
0.0	0.219226579039	We have to find out what's going on.
0.0	0.219483164905	I get to respond, right?
0.0	0.219899841474	And the fact is that that's not a democracy.
0.0	0.219936599707	That will never happen when I am president of the United States.
0.0	0.219943981356	It is undermining American democracy.
1.0	0.219972996336	I'll tell you what else they're upset about: you're 50 or 51 years old, and some kid walks in and tells you you're out of work, and you don't know where to go and where to turn.
0.0	0.220021845165	And, when I hear people talking about means testing, let's just remember what that means.
0.0	0.220137412786	There's -- look, there's --
0.0	0.220373937572	...The only way we're going to be morale, the only way we're going to keep our promise to seniors is start by following the first rule we should all follow, which is to look at them, treat them like adults, and tell them the truth.
0.0	0.220512186955	When I'm president, we're going to have a president that acts like it.
0.0	0.220577532213	Nevertheless, one of the things that I think people don't always understand is how accountable a CEO actually is.
0.0	0.220628605116	That is not what America should be about.
0.0	0.2208369182	We will rebuild the military to make sure that it is a solid force, not to be the world's policeman, but to make sure that in a peaceful world, people know that the United States is there to take care of our own national interests and take care of our allies.
0.0	0.220873099443	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.221561684959	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.221561684959	Well, thank you very much.
0.0	0.221578436921	And what we want to do is to control this.
0.0	0.221707338638	...before I go.
0.0	0.222007468901	But it is absolutely fair and necessary for Americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average American family?
0.0	0.222152560993	That expertise needs to spread all across the government and there needs to be much more cooperation with our private sector.
0.0	0.222289891502	And here's why.
0.0	0.222354542562	You know, we've got a lot of great talkers running for president.
0.0	0.222605330177	If we -- if we don't act now, we are going to be the first generation in American history that leaves our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.222651338642	But the reason America is a great country, the reason is because our compassion is in our laws.
0.0	0.22272731887	And -- you know, all of this too big to fail stuff and picking and choosing winners and losers -- this is a bunch of crap, and it is really causing a great deal of -- great deal of problems for our society right now.
0.0	0.222845052917	Oh, I'll talk about that, too.
0.0	0.222892168659	And guess what, in 2011, I got a deal...
0.0	0.222909810412	And Bernie Sanders will tell them that it's because of the rich.
0.0	0.222931456288	Caesar's -- excuse me -- Caesar's, the Rolls-Royce, as you know, is in bankruptcy.
0.0	0.22296581112	Thank you all very much.
0.0	0.223438723051	And I'll tell you, it was heartbreaking.
0.0	0.223553995303	You know, everyone here talks about the need to take on Washington.
0.0	0.223600247288	First thing I'd tell the American people, whatever it takes to defend our nation, I would do.
0.0	0.223743322108	I will, with your help and support, lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.223953236246	So we've got some real work to do, and let's try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the Russians.
0.0	0.223997692635	Well, there's no question that ISIS is a very serious problem, and I don't believe that this administration recognizes how serious it is.
0.0	0.224131170477	That is total propaganda, and this is what happens in our society.
0.0	0.224243220851	I'm not fighting that.
0.0	0.22431573004	OK.
0.0	0.22431573004	OK.
0.0	0.22431573004	OK?
0.0	0.22431573004	OK?
0.0	0.22431573004	OK?
0.0	0.22431573004	OK?
0.0	0.224378524342	...No, sir...
0.0	0.224512214766	You know, I think, again, both of us share the goal of trying to make college affordable for all young Americans.
0.0	0.224881801486	And we need to make that very clear to everybody.
0.0	0.225047750363	It works very, very well.
0.0	0.225148678306	I'm against anything that's bad for my mother.
0.0	0.225370845789	They're Muslim.
0.0	0.225375310829	But I guess I'm supposed to come out great.
0.0	0.225796061814	I think that's a mistake.
0.0	0.225862186941	... and as president, I'm going to fight for the working men and women.
0.0	0.226008560766	It's the only way to level the playing field between big and powerful and small and powerless.
0.0	0.226135454418	They can have it anyway you want.
0.0	0.226311075785	I'll say this.
0.0	0.226450333084	It is a constitutional right of every American to be able to protect themselves and their families.
0.0	0.226603150659	And just thirdly, he was so nice.
0.0	0.226896540148	Big difference.
0.0	0.226899668431	But I think this is a worldwide -- that the entire world needs to come together to deal with this horrific refugee crisis we're seeing from Syria and Afghanistan, as well.
0.0	0.227060880955	Well, first of all, recognize it is a substantial problem.
0.0	0.227069903424	We can do that in Washington.
0.0	0.22745510799	I'm not blaming Chris, by the way, but he will know about that.
0.0	0.227592207597	She wants to continue down the path of Iran, Benghazi, the Russian reset, Dodd-Frank, all the things that have -- that have gone wrong in this country, she would be a national security mess.
0.0	0.227663566794	I like it.
0.0	0.227721266456	And let's not let the secular progressives drive that out of us.
0.0	0.227836864325	You know, they feel like if they don't have a lobbyist, if they're not wealthy, that somehow they don't get to play.
0.0	0.228122388073	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.228129222349	If we're willing to do what it takes now, the 21st century is going to be the new American century, greater than any other era we've had in the history of this great nation.
0.0	0.22857470081	Folks, you want to --
0.0	0.22880664199	Maria, I'd just like to say...
0.0	0.228867596174	I am deadly serious about changing this culture.
0.0	0.228969883412	That we do all that we can to create a world of peace and prosperity.
0.0	0.229061174758	But here's the best way that we're going to make America much more exceptional: it is to make sure we put someone on that stage in September who will fight Hillary Clinton and make sure she never, ever gets in the White House again.
0.0	0.229186450718	That's good.
0.0	0.22922508805	It never happens.
0.0	0.22922508805	It never happens.
0.0	0.22950026304	We ought to have politicians who not only have government experience but know how the CEOs and the job creators work.
0.0	0.229553142312	I'll check for you.
0.0	0.229697656101	And we do need China -- Donald's right about North Korea.
0.0	0.229699422721	It's not working.
0.0	0.229859212823	And, that will get to the nub of opportunity for our children, and an ability to see wages rise.
0.0	0.229903215062	I have got deep concerns about the Fed.
0.0	0.229930350273	And that's why we're in the trouble that we're in now.
0.0	0.230029439798	He's a gifted politician.
0.0	0.23011595679	Well, Maria, thank you for that question, and let me say thank you to the state of South Carolina for welcoming us.
0.0	0.230343612223	I'm too trusting.
0.0	0.230475058517	And, yes, people we may disagree with on a number of things may have some insight, may have some relationships that are important for the president to understand in order to best protect the United States.
0.0	0.230517375142	Maria, I assume that I can respond to that.
0.0	0.230686985295	It is an agenda, in my view, that would do great harm to our country.
0.0	0.230931061421	Thank you for that question.
0.0	0.231050238667	If this all works out, I'm happy to consider naming you as V.P.
0.0	0.231184600115	Well, if the law would change, yeah.
0.0	0.231237342678	We need to make sure that people understand, as Jeb said before, that if you've done extraordinarily well in this country, do you want them to take more out of your taxes now and think they're gonna give it back to you later?
0.0	0.231430325503	Creativity.
0.0	0.231534043796	Well, you know what I'm worried about?
0.0	0.231559284523	... the American middle class, and who are being attacked by ideologues, by demagogues.
0.0	0.231759813627	I am a conservative; I can win this job, I can do this job, I need your help, I need your support.
0.0	0.231960401179	And this big powerful, corrupt bureaucracy works now only for the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected.
0.0	0.232321406055	The government ought to wear a striped shirt and just make sure the game...
0.0	0.232431272719	How are we going to do this?
0.0	0.232711446573	See when you're a senator, what you get to do is just talk and talk and talk.
0.0	0.232712947699	And when we live by those laws and we treat everybody equally under the law, that's when people feel good about being Americans.
0.0	0.232822460895	I'm ready.
0.0	0.232854150234	And Mr. Trump is very focused...
0.0	0.233029790177	You want me to answer that question?
0.0	0.233297652429	If I could just respond.
0.0	0.233459100979	You've got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...
0.0	0.233807558982	Well, yes, indeed.
0.0	0.234158194145	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.234158194145	Here's the thing.
0.0	0.234300483469	I will be that new leader.
0.0	0.234354550925	Alzheimers, diabetes, heart disease and cancer.
0.0	0.234468463406	Now, on to your substantive question.
0.0	0.234623269918	And at that point, it's a life that we have the right to protect, and I think we should protect.
0.0	0.234641682812	And I think that ought to be worth something.
0.0	0.23521053562	Well, I'm very happy to get a question this early on.
0.0	0.235540360586	And on this issue of the Medicare in particular, it's important because they're going to demagogue what we're saying here tonight.
0.0	0.235904779007	Good question, but I want to tell you, my great concern is that we are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job.
0.0	0.236001169433	So here's this -- the situation, I think, Maria.
0.0	0.236370303208	And I said, "well, if he wanted to play a song, maybe he could play, 'New York, New York'?"
0.0	0.236594135531	No vision at all.
0.0	0.236725075979	That's why I've entered this race, and I think I have the experience to do it.
1.0	0.236991602373	Believe me, that is why Ohio is doing well.
0.0	0.237028134928	I'm looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.237206090803	My background is different.
0.0	0.237238993187	I do not believe that we need to wholesale destroy every American citizen's privacy in order to go after those that we know are suspect or are -- are already a problem.
0.0	0.237268340589	You know, we -- we agree that we've got to get unaccountable money out of politics.
0.0	0.237472883481	I have studied that issue in great detail.
0.0	0.237544609627	But I was born here.
0.0	0.237715998337	But let's not kid ourselves.
0.0	0.2378874062	Not my kind of guy.
0.0	0.237980058096	Let's listen to them and let's not listen to our politicians.
0.0	0.238042740083	Well, you're talking about -- yeah.
0.0	0.238116693864	And why?
0.0	0.238326865156	Because I've done it.
0.0	0.238377508557	It's a hard problem.
0.0	0.238483832648	You want to talk about what we're going to be up against next year?
0.0	0.238530390837	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.238970325761	John, do you want me to answer or do you want to answer?
0.0	0.239214913182	I'm running for president to knock down all the barriers that are holding Americans back, and to rebuild the ladders of opportunity that will give every American a chance to advance, especially those who have been left out and left behind.
0.0	0.239266934367	The only reason why you're doing it now is because we're running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.
0.0	0.23953374543	...we need to honor our promises...
0.0	0.23972021062	Or somebody else.
0.0	0.239796213383	That is important.
0.0	0.239930731572	We need somebody who can lead.
0.0	0.239964810927	But she did say there was anger.
0.0	0.24000998178	I've learned from him that what we need to achieve is peace through strength, which means we need to rebuild the military.
0.0	0.240016375795	And hopefully -- you know, Senator Graham, I -- I know where he's going to be on this, but we use Congress, and we use Congress to cut this funding.
0.0	0.240029813023	And as president of the United States, it's all about communication, folks.
0.0	0.240196667059	And you don't go tell Muslim nations you want them to be part of a coalition when you have a leading candidate for president of the United States who insults their religion.
0.0	0.240319556726	SuperPacs are a disaster.
0.0	0.24041576852	If you looking at what happened with Boeing and if you look at what happened with so many companies that deal -- so we don't have an equal playing field.
0.0	0.240513158661	I have a feeling it's going to work out, actually.
0.0	0.240525198617	I mean, you know...
0.0	0.240533701137	You just want to...
0.0	0.240734715291	I would begin by saying that I'm not sure it's a weakness, but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for America's future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people.
0.0	0.240912935731	And that's really a theme of a lot of the things that I'm talking about.
0.0	0.240946539566	Why, for the life of me, I do not understand why did we stop doing vocational education in America, people that can work with their hands; people you can train to do this work while they're still in high school so they can graduate ready to go work.
0.0	0.240950640444	But I think they will see a very good option here.
0.0	0.241049195952	Are you serious about this election?
0.0	0.241055523445	He wants to change America.
0.0	0.241082235229	And some of them, I will say, not all, have called me and said, "Donald, thank you very much; you're exposing an unbelievable problem and we have to get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.241118159566	... with what Marco is saying is that it takes too long, they're sucking us dry and it takes too long.
0.0	0.241124838054	We don't need to add new rules, we need to make sure the FBI does its job.
0.0	0.241125186171	We have a -- they say there's no bipartisanship in Washington?
0.0	0.241385208155	And I want to just suggest to you.
0.0	0.24146986103	I'm president -- look, I've done it once.
0.0	0.241486335127	And if you elect me president, we will bring incredible growth back to this country.
0.0	0.24169894836	And the problem, Maria, is that the military is not ready, either.
0.0	0.241766916299	And together, we can solve these problems that hurt us and heal America.
0.0	0.241783743156	I'm deadly serious about doing this job the right way.
0.0	0.241859263378	You're welcome.
0.0	0.241972428953	How do we utilize our intellect rather than allowing the government to use its, quote, "intellect," in order to help us to be able to live healthier and better lives?
0.0	0.242063936607	I think -- I think it's fair to say we don't have a disagreement.
0.0	0.24220586724	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.24243911029	And when it comes to the issues that are really on the front lines as to whether we're going to have equal pay, paid family leave, some opportunity for, you know, women to go as far as their hard work and talent take them, I think that we still have some barriers to knock down, which is why that's at the core of my campaign.
0.0	0.242621361574	They expect to have it.
0.0	0.242776236921	Well, it's an interesting question because I'm very proud of my company.
0.0	0.242806243944	They are more likely to know what's happening in their families and their communities, and they need to feel not just invited, but welcomed within the American society.
0.0	0.243793829606	Well, Gwen and Judy, thank you very much for hosting this event.
0.0	0.243802624933	... president of the United States has got to do, and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility, is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe.
0.0	0.243979997186	You don't want to hear the answer.
0.0	0.244027999508	So you should go out, get a declaratory judgment, let the courts decide.
0.0	0.244096911443	So there's a lot of balanced interests.
0.0	0.24414089383	One thing I want to be clear about tonight.
0.0	0.244159312775	Can I tell you what?
0.0	0.244394968779	It goes in the right direction.
0.0	0.244435952608	You know, I see a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist.
0.0	0.244512189849	We need to get realistic about this.
0.0	0.244575741568	And our adversaries continue to grow stronger.
0.0	0.244702986553	I believe in it but we have to be smart and we have to use smart people to negotiate.
0.0	0.24482913496	So I believe as president I will look very carefully about unintended consequences.
0.0	0.245220256065	So, you know, we'll take our progress wherever we can find it.
0.0	0.245228140849	I have a debt to America I'll never repay.
0.0	0.245395400421	There'll be people here that will talk about what they're going to do.
0.0	0.245443342126	So, we are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we have to root out in our society.
0.0	0.245488935681	It is a real horror.
0.0	0.245978789148	I know personally how extraordinary and unique this nation is.
0.0	0.246123205397	With Saudi Arabia and oil production, first of all, it's so critical for us to be energy independent, and we're getting there because of fracking and we ought to explore because, see, energy independence gives us leverage and flexibility, and secondly, if you want to bring jobs back to the United States of America in industry, low prices make the difference.
0.0	0.246206537402	Why is that?
0.0	0.246337896062	You don't solve it by big talk where you're banning all Muslims and making it harder for us to build the kind of coalition for us to be successful.
0.0	0.24647745118	And you look around, and you see what's happening, and this is not the case when he introduced the doctor -- very nice, everything perfect but that is not representative of what you have in that line of migration.
0.0	0.246514731718	I agree with them.
0.0	0.246533727287	We have got to make sure that local police departments look like the communities they serve in their diversity.
0.0	0.246558316115	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.246789754035	But I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost.
0.0	0.247113679966	Big government favors the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected, and crushes the small and the powerless.
0.0	0.247116889738	And we got to look at the big picture here.
0.0	0.247160166687	It's true.
0.0	0.247314455757	But the president leads in this regard.
0.0	0.247318656436	This guy is a petulant child.
0.0	0.247340064188	I'm tired of the hyphenated Americans and the division.
0.0	0.247703202493	I want to take care of women.
0.0	0.247735413437	What we have to do is end over-policing in African- American neighborhoods.
0.0	0.247738717552	I love China.
0.0	0.247902156131	I'm the only person on this stage who's done that and we will get it done as President of the United States.
0.0	0.248386092409	If you want someone who's not going to divide Washington, but gets things done, then you should make me your president.
0.0	0.24843469883	Well, Neil, I'm glad we're focusing on the important topics of the evening.
0.0	0.248925522808	I believe that it's most important that we unleash the full potential of women and girls in our society.
0.0	0.249172761603	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.249424025593	So I think the better approach, the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against China economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage Barack Obama is doing to this economy.
0.0	0.249963160026	I mean, I ask that with all due respect.
0.0	0.250099615269	And, that's why tonight I'm asking you for your vote.
0.0	0.250115181635	I would choose Nelson Mandela for his generosity of heart, his understanding of the need for reconciliation.
0.0	0.250165584783	Let me just -- let me respond.
0.0	0.250188307905	...I'm going to go to Washington to stop it...
0.0	0.250287844989	And, let me now on Social Security because we were getting into a good substantive exchange, and I want to say I think both Chris, and Mike are right.
0.0	0.250663050707	Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.
0.0	0.250816368283	And I'm very grateful to the brave Navy SEALs who carried out that mission.
0.0	0.251045087712	First of all, I'd like to recognize Governor Haley for her incredible leadership in the aftermath of the --
0.0	0.251087260697	But, the real issue, I think, that the Senator is injecting into this is that if you had a Super PAC, like President Obama has, which now says it wants to support me.
0.0	0.251163580683	But let's not -- but let's not -- let's not insult -- let's not insult the intelligence of the American people.
0.0	0.251715583255	That is what I believe.
0.0	0.251826210248	I think the American people are look for real leadership.
0.0	0.251861556458	I will do everything I can to make certain that the United States and our brave men and women in the military do not get bogged down in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.
0.0	0.252059877762	(LAUGHTER) And he got nasty.
0.0	0.252167750389	We have to do something.
0.0	0.252279878686	That's a serious issue that we could work on.
0.0	0.252297113302	I just hope that by the end of this campaign there will be a lot more supporting me.
0.0	0.252601470878	And let me be clear.
0.0	0.252675183371	No, it's true.
0.0	0.252980157753	I think President Obama has set a great example.
0.0	0.253048896773	We will make America great again.
0.0	0.253295180725	I will tell you that.
0.0	0.25335481086	When I am president, I will work consistently every single day to keep this country safe, not call Edward Snowden, as you did, a great public servant.
0.0	0.253358950324	And we're talking about fantasy football?
0.0	0.253980642	And the same goes for overseas, where we have to put together a coalition of Muslim nations.
0.0	0.254026944111	That is the thing that obviously makes sense, we can do that.
0.0	0.254059581514	Because -- because Donald's mother was born in Scotland.
0.0	0.2541818249	If you want someone to grab a beer with, I may not be that guy.
0.0	0.254488080072	And -- and -- you know, it goes back to the whole concept of regulations, which are in everything.
0.0	0.254801612857	Our friends no longer think we have their back and our enemies no longer fear us, and we're in a much difficult -- we're in a much different position than we should be.
0.0	0.255063201375	And then the Government steps in to try and solve the problem and we get a little further down to that progressive vision that Hillary Clinton is talking about.
0.0	0.255084460082	The way to take that away from them is to talk to our military officials and ask them, "what do you need in order to accomplish this goal?"
0.0	0.255235948947	We have work to do, and we now know a lot more than we ever did before.
0.0	0.25550951645	There's only a promise to pay by the next generation, and the next generation's not big enough to pay it.
0.0	0.255617705306	See, here's the thing.
0.0	0.255773678286	We elected a president that is weakening America on the global stage.
0.0	0.256164736983	We need someone to fight for the people.
0.0	0.256294748632	But I think it is really unfair to suggest that I have not been supportive of the president.
0.0	0.256451428649	Why?
0.0	0.2564821304	So what we're going to have to start doing instead of, you know, picking on this group or this group, is we're going to have to have a major reduction in the regulatory influence that is going on.
0.0	0.256692558431	Not bad.
0.0	0.25670571309	What you saw was a parade of, "I'll give you this for free; I'll give you that for free."
0.0	0.256800325166	They get -- they steal them.
0.0	0.256924979517	That's what they're doing.
0.0	0.257242956117	Or that we're just going to be great?
0.0	0.257283172209	My plan would sweep all of them into a regulatory framework so we can try to get ahead of what the next problems might be.
0.0	0.257289385996	I'll give you a fact.
0.0	0.257393517977	It's not that hard.
0.0	0.257548512626	I think he means somebody who hasn't been a career politician, and who's been out of office for awhile.
0.0	0.257765298541	You looking at me?
0.0	0.257793361302	Lawrence Tribe and (inaudible) from Harvard -- of Harvard, said that there is a serious question as to whether or not Ted can do this.
0.0	0.257829781819	The economy was really booming.
0.0	0.258305259337	I will change the culture in Washington, just as I changed the culture in Tallahassee.
0.0	0.258345713197	All of those things are important, and all those things would happen in a Christie administration.
0.0	0.258363110617	And I'm glad I did it.
0.0	0.258455511405	When I'm president of the United States, we are going to win this war on ISIS.
0.0	0.258800801826	You gotta be patient.
0.0	0.258822658408	I believe we are on the path to doing that.
0.0	0.258924448572	You have got to pick somebody who has experience, somebody that has the know-how, the discipline.
0.0	0.258954743809	And unlike President Obama, where he refuses even to use the term of what's going on, he can't use the term for whatever reason.
0.0	0.258993022122	This president and John Kerry and Hillary Clinton all have made it harder for the next president to act, but he must act to confront the ambitions of Iran.
0.0	0.259244785198	I think I'm going to win fair and square (inaudible) to win this way.
0.0	0.259513804639	And our economy was growing like crazy.
0.0	0.259528659954	All we need to do is protect them, they will be in their own country.
0.0	0.259592257473	And what I think all of us are saying is, our monetary policy, our tax policy, regulatory policy needs to be radically changed so we can create high sustained growth for income to rise.
0.0	0.259627517691	I've created tens of thousands of jobs, and in all due respect -- and actually some of these folks I really like a lot -- but I'm the only one that can say that.
0.0	0.259781349116	I like Marco Rubio.
0.0	0.260003773037	Well, first let me address the tax issue because it's related to the entitlement issue and I want to thank you for holding a substantive debates where we can have debates about these key issues on taxes.
0.0	0.260049059804	It's what I've done or not done, or it's war.
0.0	0.260180663437	You have to have certainty.
0.0	0.26043785811	We're going to be tough at the border, we're going to be tough on all of the illegal immigrants that everybody else in this field -- we're going to be different.
0.0	0.260461089374	Well, I don't know if it's a blind trust if Ivanka, Don and Eric run it.
0.0	0.260466491908	The men and women on this stage have more ideas, more experience, more common sense than every participant in the Democratic debate.
0.0	0.26076921613	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.260810151745	I'm prepared.
0.0	0.260899469806	They're very concerned about it.
0.0	0.260933879348	And as far as the Syrians are concerned, Al-Hasakah province, perfect place.
0.0	0.260937328557	Let me tell you how that question...
0.0	0.261021400214	What should we do?
0.0	0.261161750011	Community has to understand that that police officer wants to get home at night, and not -- not to lose their life.
0.0	0.261240564896	Recognize that the caliphate is what gives them the legitimacy to go out on a jihadist mission, so we need to take that away from them.
0.0	0.261302404381	That's absurd, and I think people who don't want to fix it, really, or unwilling to take the chance to say, "something has to change," are missing the boat here.
0.0	0.261350637289	I'm asking people to support me because I think I'm the most qualified, experienced, and ready person to be the president and the commander- in-chief.
0.0	0.261699703565	I want to ask you: Are you fed up with how Washington taxes you?
0.0	0.261945356622	I think that would have been right, as well.
0.0	0.261978760193	I think Americans want someone to have a track record of showing them how to get this country back on record, someone who will stand up and every day project that best days of America are in front of us.
0.0	0.261993951356	I want to get ahead of those, and that's why I've proposed a much more comprehensive approach to deal with all of these...
0.0	0.262196236878	So yeah, someone who makes more money...
0.0	0.262362369241	Here's the problem.
0.0	0.262453692897	They understand that there's a national security risk.
0.0	0.262563489481	Larry Kudlow is an example, who I have a lot of respect for, who loves my tax plan.
0.0	0.262606147826	But you know, we don't want to put everybody in the same category.
0.0	0.262732914549	You see, folks, this is how socialism starts.
0.0	0.262766098458	I've done it.
0.0	0.262774843561	I've been passionate my whole life about the Constitution.
0.0	0.262780012834	They worked hard to provide us the chance at a better life.
0.0	0.262797242144	They are much more than that.
0.0	0.262817989511	And until we deal with the health of Americans and do what we did with polio -- when I was a little kid, we eradicated it.
0.0	0.262850613907	And...
0.0	0.262850613907	But...
0.0	0.262857666214	And it's important that people really look hard at what the threats and dangers we face are, and who is best prepared for dealing with them.
0.0	0.262963426692	He consistently underestimates it but I do not.
0.0	0.26341528142	You know, you look at women working.
0.0	0.263492957007	OK, just so you understand -- I know so much about trading about with China.
0.0	0.263907245821	You know, let me say something at the outset.
0.0	0.263934270629	And I'll tell you, I'm not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump.
0.0	0.263960585028	And I ask you to join me in truth and honesty and integrity.
0.0	0.263989047041	So we need 1,000.
0.0	0.263992153247	But in 2008, we elected a president that didn't want to fix America.
0.0	0.264082675901	I'm tested.
0.0	0.264084052458	Everybody just needs to get used to it.
0.0	0.264105788002	I think now what I've called for is counsel for every child so that no child has to face any kind of process without someone who speaks and advocates for that child so that the right decision hopefully can be made.
0.0	0.264383257551	See, they don't like that.
0.0	0.264649725428	Here's the way you need to deal with it.
0.0	0.264730710215	And when we talk about Wall Street, let's talk about Wall Street.
0.0	0.264903635778	My Muslim friends, some, said, "thank you very much; we'll get to the bottom of it."
0.0	0.265059276906	I think what we need is a commander in chief who is focused like a laser on keeping this country safe and on defeating radical Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.265345292038	I'm a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.26538107964	What I said was I don't believe that I would be president of the United States and have the same dysfunction that exists in Washington, D.C. now.
0.0	0.265446342082	I'm angry because our country is a mess.
0.0	0.265447476793	It has to be dealt with.
0.0	0.265465733738	We need Jordan.
0.0	0.265530008369	When you head back to airport tonight, go check and see what the...
0.0	0.265599215347	I look at Washington, and I hear the talk, and I see the promises and it seems nothing ever changes.
0.0	0.26565245908	And I won't be angry when we fix it, but until we fix it, I'm very, very angry.
0.0	0.265683236646	And I would not stand for that as president of the United States.
0.0	0.265724979938	I would hold a Camp David summit with our Arab allies, not to talk them into this lousy deal with Iran, but to say to them, "what is it that you need to defeat ISIL?"
0.0	0.265748386391	We have to show that we can march to a balanced budget.
0.0	0.266172254825	A rich person does not.
0.0	0.266189340827	If you elect me president of the United States, I will secure that southern border.
0.0	0.266222718093	Well, I am going to answer your question, Neil.
0.0	0.266333856557	But I think there has to be recognition that if we -- if we are too punitive, then you'll go to other -- other technology companies outside the United States.
0.0	0.266361598353	ON the other side, you have so many Republicans, and what do they care about?
0.0	0.266403322108	This is a remarkable and horrifying fact.
0.0	0.266476486213	We are trying to bring America together around an agenda that works for working families and the middle class.
0.0	0.266503759639	Americans are tired of hearing this debate -- want to go to, what are you going to do about illegal immigration?
0.0	0.266562162641	And you know what?
0.0	0.266562162641	And you know what?
0.0	0.266562162641	And you know what?
0.0	0.266562162641	And you know what?
0.0	0.266562162641	And you know what?
0.0	0.266562162641	And you know what?
0.0	0.266562162641	But you know what?
0.0	0.26673077415	We just want to be the rich."
0.0	0.266857120871	So you know what?
0.0	0.267065183226	Yes, I'm going to do away with that.
0.0	0.267127173394	We need to control the border, we need to do all of this in a comprehensive way, not just going back and forth and talking about stuff --
0.0	0.267335691523	It's the same thing that I did in Ohio.
0.0	0.267410987944	But, let me tell you who not to blame.
0.0	0.267535934611	No, it speaks to the fact that I don't know those --
0.0	0.267814228601	Just a little bit.
0.0	0.267895497282	Where the secretary and I have a very profound difference, in the last debate -- and I believe in her book -- very good book, by the way -- in her book and in this last debate, she talked about getting the approval or the support or the mentoring of Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.26789954471	They're tough, they're strong, they're great people.
0.0	0.268316077815	I'm interested in making sure we get the maximum amount of revenue from those who can well afford to provide it.
0.0	0.268331522819	So I don't know if you would call that a weakness, but my wife said "let up."
0.0	0.268454684988	In this particular moment of serious crises, saying to the American people don't give up on the political process.
0.0	0.268626314189	Do we have answer for that?
0.0	0.268666335263	Right.
0.0	0.268666335263	Right.
0.0	0.268666335263	Right.
0.0	0.268666335263	Right.
0.0	0.268666335263	Right.
0.0	0.268749599397	This deal in Washington is an example of why Washington's broken.
0.0	0.268793683947	They are trying to attack us here in America.
0.0	0.26912487173	We will renew America if we work together, and I am totally confident that we will.
0.0	0.269624803235	We're running.
0.0	0.269990253545	I have worked for his re-election.
0.0	0.269998683517	It is disgraceful, and in a Christie administration, they would know much, much better than to do that.
0.0	0.270060631516	But we are where we are right now.
0.0	0.270133839105	And it's especially significant that they are working with both Turkey and Greece in order to do this.
0.0	0.270203484927	You gotta be creative and imaginative.
0.0	0.270332011247	Well, that's easy to answer.
0.0	0.270371235983	That the Ayatollah is a radical jihadist who really means it when he chants, "Death to America, death to Israel."
0.0	0.270425405428	And the reasons why I've done is I don't believe we have a good process of being able to vet them.
0.0	0.270527419416	And yes, I am angry.
0.0	0.270531834853	Well, I don't know.
0.0	0.270750602782	Bad by those in the Senate who voted for it and if I'm president, we'll make our intelligence community strong, and won't have to keep everybody out, we're just going to keep the bad folk out and make sure they don't harm us.
0.0	0.27088689498	Where I see the weakness is in those three people that are left on the Democratic stage.
0.0	0.271116085018	We also want to dominate this from a commercial side.
0.0	0.27123365702	You want to talk about moral authority.
0.0	0.271258952275	We also need a nominee, a candidate who will endorse our own principles.
0.0	0.27142663618	With respect to the United States, I think our role in NATO, our support for the E.U., as well as our willingness to take refugees so long as they are thoroughly vetted and that we have confidence from intelligence and other sources that they can come to our country, we should be doing our part.
0.0	0.271513695253	Everybody's record's going to be scrutinized, and at the end of the day we need to unite behind the winner so we can defeat Hillary Clinton, because she is a disaster.
0.0	0.271520420289	Here's the thing that I would ask Donald Trump in all seriousness.
0.0	0.271643943902	It will never happen because they'll let their currency go up.
0.0	0.271886461834	But let me go back to something that's very important.
0.0	0.272154495848	We need a president who can solve our problems, bring us together.
0.0	0.272187701112	And kind of -- that's what I see our campaign is about right now.
0.0	0.272223508655	She was a great CEO.
0.0	0.272378809042	I'm a Catholic, I believe life begins at conception.
0.0	0.272603929881	As president of the United States, I will be a commander in chief that will have the back of the military.
0.0	0.272951042348	And, I'll do that with the country.
0.0	0.272951731095	How about we get the government to do what they're supposed to be doing, secure our borders, protect our people, and support American values and American families.
0.0	0.272957189322	In my administration, we will help to make sure we bring people together in the Middle East, and we will fight ISIS and defeat them.
0.0	0.272965744426	I win.
0.0	0.273052931683	Bencarson.com -- we will heal, inspire and revive America for our children.
0.0	0.273102971166	I'm going to get a response to that, Neil.
0.0	0.273343257073	I want to speak to all of those maddened by political correctness, where Hillary Clinton apologizes for saying all lives matter.
0.0	0.273472735291	When people ask me, whose fault is it?
0.0	0.273700989796	I'm very angry because our country is being run horribly and I will gladly accept the mantle of anger.
0.0	0.273737154546	That's an interesting question.
0.0	0.273791466886	They have a responsibility, as well.
0.0	0.274003090747	The answer is yes.
0.0	0.274014507902	They're off to China.
0.0	0.274153700564	You know, every election we hear a lot of talk.
0.0	0.274366006217	Hey, I'm in the United States Senate, and anyone who doesn't think that there is an enormous amount of waste and inefficiency and bureaucracy throughout government would be very, very mistaken.
0.0	0.274385319598	I can see why people are angry and scared, because this president has created a condition where our national security has weakened dramatically.
0.0	0.274412073615	He was such a nice guy.
0.0	0.274564677833	Here's my second problem.
0.0	0.274567958222	You get together.
0.0	0.274578892751	It's kind of basic.
0.0	0.274643932189	And you had better get rid of them, because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.274684750509	Hey look, he never had a chance.
0.0	0.274914188731	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the Constitution.
0.0	0.275082703064	Let me be clear.
0.0	0.275089028714	As you too know, I know I built a very great company.
0.0	0.275105073409	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.275105073409	You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.
0.0	0.275168052388	So, yes, we can talk about it as a racial issue.
1.0	0.275311462145	Strong, powerful men, young and people are looking at that and they're saying what's going on?
0.0	0.275329702519	Now, we're going to blame the people.
0.0	0.275345930315	Judy, if I can, there is no question, Secretary Clinton and I are friends, and I have a lot of respect for her, that she has enormous experience in foreign affairs.
0.0	0.275479334051	We have to get back into looking at what's causing it.
0.0	0.275525773714	Well, Rick, it's a very important question.
0.0	0.275649880278	That is a bad deal and an evil situation, and presidents have looked the other way.
0.0	0.275777601896	But what happens if, God forbid, the next Barack Obama takes over, and the next Nancy Pelosi, and the next Harry Reid...
0.0	0.27605220859	(inaudible), the great majority of Republicans and Americans believe in a hopeful future.
0.0	0.276132620045	This is a great nation.
0.0	0.276532612893	I believe we should be appointing Supreme Court justices who will follow the law and not try to make the law.
0.0	0.276673078093	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.276673078093	But if you look at working men and women.
0.0	0.276919253675	We're going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education.
0.0	0.276984029104	Yes, they've got to get out of Syria.
0.0	0.277037342166	I think it's a good product.
0.0	0.277135693403	Because the damage he has done to America is extraordinary.
0.0	0.277200843529	The D.C. politicians continue to make things worse.
0.0	0.277268845857	They are not perfect.
0.0	0.277643602918	Well, it's interesting.
0.0	0.277669110582	And we will be strong again.
0.0	0.277730361028	We got to do a lot about the high cost of high -- higher education, but we've got to make sure we're training people for jobs that exist, that are good jobs that can pay.
0.0	0.277752173727	I'd like to jump in.
0.0	0.277767281432	As an outsider, I tackled H.P.
0.0	0.27789195377	Well, let us level with the American people.
0.0	0.278538200886	This is an interesting point when you talk about immigration.
0.0	0.278686345045	So count me in as somebody who will not be listening to Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.278789681138	The entire system of legal immigration must now be reexamined for security first and foremost, with an eye on ISIS.
0.0	0.278835675192	You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president...
0.0	0.278893739331	I mean, just think about a scenario like that.
0.0	0.278905615409	We need someone with a steady hand being president of the United States.
0.0	0.278961296322	So I have nothing at all critical of him.
0.0	0.279082803395	There are lids on people's aspirations.
0.0	0.279604468026	And what I have said is I will not throw us further into debt.
0.0	0.279706796291	Every one of us is gifted by God, whether it is those poor babies being picked over or it's someone whose life is tangled up in a web of dependence.
0.0	0.279915658827	He doesn't want to get people together, the old-fashioned way, where you get Congress.
0.0	0.280094839345	Because, folks, at the end of the day, the country needs healed.
0.0	0.280124154978	I understand we can disagree on the path forward.
0.0	0.280365463207	Donald, Donald -- can I -- I hope you reconsider this, because this policy is a policy that makes it impossible to build the coalition necessary to take out ISIS.
0.0	0.280401177975	His family certainly believes that.
0.0	0.280556594825	So, it's going to be my responsibility to make sure we move forward to solve these problems that are now out in the open.
0.0	0.280574029453	That's the difference.
0.0	0.280585860198	They're going to end up in the productive economy, which is where we want them.
0.0	0.280948163121	Maria, let me clear something up here.
0.0	0.280996155204	I got that.
0.0	0.281159168766	That is not consistent conservatism, that is political calculation.
0.0	0.281190682055	So when somebody like Donald Trump and others...
0.0	0.281301187845	And I want to make this our government.
1.0	0.28156404335	Our military is a disaster.
0.0	0.281571164424	You're right.
0.0	0.281571164424	You're right.
0.0	0.281837636765	This is the unholy alliance that people need to know about between right and left.
0.0	0.281946603201	You are working at McDonald's?
0.0	0.281946695813	We have to work with NATO to protect Eastern Europe against any kind of Russian aggression.
0.0	0.282234078848	Yeah, they are unhinged.
0.0	0.282323022084	They don't believe in building walls and a pessimistic view of the future.
0.0	0.282663384364	We have to be prepared to defend the American people, prepare them for a long war, stand up for the defense of this country, and stand up for the values of this country...
0.0	0.282882879418	So I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.282957315558	We're on the verge of being the first generation of Americans that leave our children worse off than ourselves.
0.0	0.282966590093	No accomplishment.
0.0	0.283054478407	Yes.
0.0	0.283054478407	Yes.
0.0	0.283054478407	Yes.
0.0	0.283054478407	Yes.
0.0	0.28319315306	So look, corporations ought to exercise some responsibility.
0.0	0.283241288817	It's not my PAC.
0.0	0.283563755677	And listen, there is a real difference between Marco's tax plan and mine.
0.0	0.283609377969	I think there is constitutional and legal authority for the president to have done what he did.
0.0	0.283837370442	I will do so in a way that will bring people together.
0.0	0.283978482701	Not a very pleasant place to be.
0.0	0.284112073949	You know, I am by my nature impatient.
0.0	0.284173796241	They are the ones who should respond to any questions.
0.0	0.284264748309	We need to have stronger families.
0.0	0.284499693461	How about this?
0.0	0.284717422455	Well, I've been --
0.0	0.284962008376	I want to speak to all the moms and dads whose sons and daughters are fighting for this country, and the incredible sense of betrayal when you have a commander-in-chief who will not even speak the name of our enemy, radical Islamic terrorism, when you have a commander-in- chief who sends $150 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, who's responsible for murdering hundreds of our servicemen and women.
0.0	0.285096048711	Big and powerful use big and powerful government to their advantage.
0.0	0.285218534769	And, we have a government and leaders in government that are completely out of touch, and that's why I'm running for president.
0.0	0.2852437471	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.28529395278	I am a conservative because I know our values, our principles and our policies --
0.0	0.285376099855	And we can take that message and that formula to Washington to lift every single American to a better life.
0.0	0.285398879285	You know, I want to go back for a moment to what we were just talking about.
0.0	0.285408030403	We must insist on assimilation -- immigration without assimilation is an invasion.
0.0	0.285411536219	And why I am a staunch supporter of President Obama's principal accomplishment -- namely the Affordable Care Act -- is because I know how hard it was to get that done.
0.0	0.285569297244	I'm never going to change my tune.
0.0	0.285629824329	They have to have some legal basis and precedence for being able to follow the law instead of making the law up, and my goal is -- in appointing Supreme Court justices, would be to point -- to appoint justices who would follow the law.
0.0	0.285974280024	There are politics in the boardroom as well.
0.0	0.286242973727	...
0.0	0.286242973727	...
0.0	0.286242973727	...
0.0	0.286242973727	...
0.0	0.286242973727	...
0.0	0.286242973727	...
1.0	0.286395118883	I was not at all critical of him.
0.0	0.286411163811	It needs to be repealed and replaced.
0.0	0.286434169652	I'll tell you, in my family there are a lot of single moms in my family.
0.0	0.286461125509	Someone who's going to stand up, and be very clear with our enemies as to the lines their going to draw and stand with them.
0.0	0.286643589305	How can you run for the Republican nomination and be for single- payer health care?
0.0	0.286676390043	So you might not.
0.0	0.286906140361	And I think once I'm in the White House we will have enough political capital to be able to do that.
0.0	0.286963201282	I am not a single- issue candidate, and I do not believe we live in a single-issue country.
0.0	0.286987802961	We have to find out -- many people knew about what was going on.
0.0	0.287082971595	He's penalized -- and doesn't understand.
0.0	0.287089947104	They are -- they're in a position where they're smothering people.
0.0	0.287228384554	He is a good man.
0.0	0.2872514627	It's very important we focus on the threats we face today, and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in.
0.0	0.287580555195	That's the side we need to be on, and that's the side of the bulk of the -- of the Middle East.
0.0	0.287652444372	The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.
0.0	0.287716179258	That could be the great Trojan Horse.
0.0	0.287824961981	They built the great wall of China.
0.0	0.288047988543	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.288047988543	We're not doing it.
0.0	0.288058157023	Look, that's who I stand up for.
0.0	0.288251770951	Growth is the answer.
0.0	0.288351034364	I'm worried about bankrupting the American people.
0.0	0.288351826003	Because that's what we'd get if it were Jeb -- I tell you what, we don't need that.
0.0	0.288662834658	... on Larry Tribe.
0.0	0.288673675469	But you know, here's the real issue, is this America anymore?
0.0	0.288746731568	If you're running for president of the United States and you don't understand that we need more American ground forces in Iraq and that America has to be part of a regional ground force that will go into Syria and destroy ISIL in Syria, then you're not ready to be commander in chief.
0.0	0.288827193245	And it creates a -- a contempt for the law, for the rule of law.
0.0	0.288828580412	This issue now has to be about stopping ISIS entering the United States, and when I'm president we will.
0.0	0.289057668857	But all of my career, you know, having been raised in -- by a mailman father whose father was a coal miner, who died of black lung and was losing his eyesight; or a mother whose mother could barely speak English.
0.0	0.289091144341	And we know of the tragic, terrible event that lead to the death of Dontre Hamilton right here in Milwaukee, a young man unarmed, who should still be with us.
0.0	0.289141512167	This is the only time I've had a chance, let me finish.
0.0	0.289383833274	I am the man who can bring us together to do that, and I ask for your vote.
0.0	0.289875016675	And if I were the prosecutor, that is exactly where they would be.
0.0	0.290017817676	They can solve the problem of North Korea if they wanted to but they taunt us.
0.0	0.290085068809	I have...
0.0	0.290321143211	We call that the American Dream, although, it's built on the universal dream of a better life.
0.0	0.290424704485	We feel like we're being left behind and left out.
0.0	0.290480113633	So this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle.
0.0	0.290569129644	The answer is no.
0.0	0.29060568495	A person who, in fact, has a long experience in foreign-policy issues, which is different from many of the other governors and prospective governors who are running.
0.0	0.290687716822	Barack Obama believes that America is a arrogant global power that needs to be cut down to size.
0.0	0.291234238537	And here's what the economic issue is.
0.0	0.291326832936	And I think the reason he did is because immigration is sort of an example of what's broken and what's wrong in Washington, D..C.
0.0	0.2915034015	And the politicians always say it is so complicated, nobody but a politician can figure it out.
0.0	0.291983418046	... the fact is -- the fact is the reason why that no one wants to answer entitlements up here is because it's hard.
0.0	0.292027866869	Well, I did.
0.0	0.29203669478	If you can encrypt messages, ISIS can, over these platforms, and we have no ability to have a cooperative relationship --
0.0	0.292039419166	We can do a wall.
0.0	0.292062825093	And second, the First Amendment Defense Act, which is protecting religious liberty, if it's not passed by then, which I suspect it won't, because the president will veto it, I will institute an executive order to make sure that people of faith are not being -- not being harassed and persecuted by the federal government for standing up for the religious beliefs.
0.0	0.292093527846	I want a government so small I can barely see it.
0.0	0.29221686531	I'm wearing a Trump tie tonight.
0.0	0.292242699536	There is a great deal of skepticism about the federal government.
0.0	0.292345625693	Well, this is what I would say.
0.0	0.292386070365	The second will be to the supreme leader of Iran.
0.0	0.292389200818	And we don't need a weak person being president of the United State, OK?
0.0	0.292556862188	That's how you solve the problem.
0.0	0.292693140717	... so you don't actually want to hear the answer, John?
0.0	0.292805529604	That's right.
0.0	0.292992475094	No -- no...
0.0	0.292998281296	And that's what we should focus on is the violence in our communities.
0.0	0.293001023408	Well, let's just -- let's just follow up on this, because, you know, I've made it very clear that no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail, and because of Dodd-Frank, we now have in law a process that the president, the Federal Reserve, and others can use if any bank poses a systemic risk.
0.0	0.293134555387	This would be devastating for the economy.
0.0	0.293152265418	Our country rise up again, but we need to have a compelling conservative agenda that we present to the American people in a way that doesn't disparage people, that unites us around our common purpose.
0.0	0.293362739753	If you're a Washington lobbyist, if you make your money in and around Washington, things are doing great.
0.0	0.293416695527	... on the issue -- on the issue of citizenship, Donald...
0.0	0.293643288544	And just so -- if I could, because he insulted a lot of people.
0.0	0.293715474317	I think that's a major accomplishment.
0.0	0.293875431604	But this is what you're seeing in the Republican debate that you didn't see in that Democrat debate.
0.0	0.29387727553	What -- what -- you're from New York?
0.0	0.293984563937	Eradicate those and you fix Medicare and you've fixed America, its economy and you've made people's lives a heck of a lot better.
0.0	0.29406977411	But I feel that the gun-free zones and, you know, when you say that, that's target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill. That's target.
0.0	0.294146826065	Now, what I think is that right now we have got to do our best in developing positive relations with Russia.
0.0	0.29417338726	It will be a way of life.
0.0	0.294175721812	The president wants to do things without working with his Congress, without working with the legislature, and without getting the consent of the American people.
0.0	0.29437190264	I know the Democrats have the ultimate SuperPac.
0.0	0.294503315148	Take it from Lawrence Tribe.
0.0	0.294693667388	I think that is the real key here.
0.0	0.294703164743	And there's a reason why Hillary's supporters are echoing Donald's attacks on me, because Hillary...
0.0	0.294754225	It worked for Reagan and it works for our team in Ohio.
0.0	0.294785600003	I will not take advice from Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.294835001077	But -- if for some reason, Neil, he beats the rest of the field, I already know the Democrats are going to be bringing a suit.
0.0	0.294931598011	Look, under President Obama and Secretary Clinton, they're working hard to change the American dream into the European nightmare.
0.0	0.294988832374	And then we need to shut down -- we need to shut down their mechanisms of funding and attack their command-and-control centers.
0.0	0.295037689746	That is not right.
0.0	0.295037689746	That's not right.
0.0	0.295037689746	That's not right.
0.0	0.295189340216	We're going to start the process of securing that border.
0.0	0.295190625259	We need a president that doesn't just talk a game, but a president that's got real results.
0.0	0.295687142027	We have to provide the NATO support to back up the mission that is going on.
0.0	0.296084772615	Now, I can tell you there are a lot of private-sector things that you could do with $12,500, which will get you a lot more than you get from this government program.
0.0	0.296202478333	We hear all this discussion about well, I would do this, or I would do that, when the fact is, the border is still porous.
0.0	0.296220013982	I agree, however, it doesn't go far enough, because what it focuses on are the big banks, which Senator Sanders has talked about a lot, for good reason.
0.0	0.296249877507	We are looking at an economy in which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.
0.0	0.296255541047	And here in Wisconsin, I want to reiterate: We've got to stand up for unions and working people who have done it before...
0.0	0.296361959336	There are loads of great ideas, great conservative ideas from wonderful think tanks about how to reform the tax code.
0.0	0.296417435872	I do not think we should promise or even look toward normalizing relations because we have a lot of other business to get done with Iran.
0.0	0.296514647287	If you'll answer the (inaudible) core question.
0.0	0.296541795044	I hope you'll reconsider.
0.0	0.296568115007	I can govern by bringing people together.
0.0	0.29673706426	How about talking about the substantive issues the people care about?
0.0	0.297034013104	And worse -- worse yet, to be honest with you, Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster.
0.0	0.297385971767	You want to see a war on women?
0.0	0.297507819219	I love Donald Trump.
0.0	0.297828299048	Actually going to do something to help the American worker.
0.0	0.297859122762	We need to rebuild our families.
0.0	0.297990698349	I will begin tomorrow to filibuster it.
0.0	0.297991263617	Now, let me ask you a question everybody, and, this is for the guy, you know, who owns a landscaping business out there.
0.0	0.298002074076	And you talk so much that nobody can ever keep up with what you're saying is accurate or not.
0.0	0.298169259126	You will begin to see jobs created in a robust economy.
0.0	0.298171489709	The president doesn't understand -- and by the way, neither does Secretary Clinton -- and here's my warning to everybody out in the audience tonight.
0.0	0.29830225709	Well, first of all, if a company gets caught doing that, they should never be able to use the program again.
0.0	0.298351445475	He doesn't meet -- here's the difference.
0.0	0.298403290637	These...
0.0	0.298435317441	They're never going to let it happen.
0.0	0.298467538436	I looked at the intelligence.
0.0	0.298526476169	Turns out that the African-American community and the Latino community were hit especially hard.
0.0	0.298530758503	This nation has been great to me, and that's the only way I know to pay you back.
0.0	0.298539823939	Fiscal discipline, know what you're doing.
0.0	0.298580027882	I was not that candidate.
0.0	0.298591953525	You know, we have to stop this because, you know, if we manage to damage ourselves, and we lose the next election, and a progressive gets in there and they get two or three Supreme Court picks, this nation is over as we know it.
0.0	0.29861926806	And wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong.
0.0	0.298910093927	There's nobody out there looking out for the American worker.
0.0	0.298935339812	Also, when you look at these videos, they are horrific and show just a hideous disrespect for life.
0.0	0.298939552181	And I agree about the role that he played both in war and in peace on the economy and defeating fascism around the world.
0.0	0.298958500841	And that's what I hear from some people, "we'll do nothing and it will just be fixed."
0.0	0.298967103456	So we have work to do.
0.0	0.298979830153	I want to talk to the folks at home.
0.0	0.299309039908	You know, whatever your issue, your cause, the festering problem you hoped would resolved, the political class has failed you.
0.0	0.299391329451	But in addition to that, we have to have fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.299441754206	And the idea that this negotiation -- I will tell you one thing.
0.0	0.299450550275	And just to finish, people say, how will you get Mexico to pay?
0.0	0.299457184095	I will show you what they do to women.
0.0	0.299742033774	Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.299824914349	I think the times are different now.
0.0	0.299830637351	That's the truth of the matter and you see it every time with this president.
0.0	0.300064588259	What we ought to do is tighten up our efforts to deal with the entry visa program so that a citizen from Europe, it's harder if they've been traveling to Syria or traveling to these other places where there is Islamic terrorism, make it harder -- make the screening take place.
0.0	0.300173961689	At the same time, law enforcement understands there are people in the community who not only think that the system doesn't work for them, but works against them.
0.0	0.300501032291	We could do a whole show on that.
0.0	0.300648003747	It is a complicated relationship.
0.0	0.30110005071	There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies.
0.0	0.301150648807	Folks, we have a problem here with the leadership in Washington, but I'll tell you another problem.
0.0	0.301192814119	What a president of the United States has got to do -- and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility -- is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe, that we work with allies around the world to protect...
0.0	0.301248335004	If that's a blind trust, I don't know.
0.0	0.301269798834	Don't vote for me if you want to keep the gridlock in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.301434491375	It is time to believe in America again.
0.0	0.301543763175	But the good news is the next commander-in-chief is standing on this stage.
0.0	0.301626987754	When I was in Washington, I fought to get the budget balanced.
0.0	0.301658561637	He doesn't understand the threat in ISIS.
0.0	0.301690796485	I know that we are at greater risk today than at any time since then of another attack.
0.0	0.301879566722	We need to solve problems, we need to rebuild our military so we can stand up to radical Islam, we need to get our economy growing much faster by throwing out the corrupt tax code and lowering the rates.
0.0	0.301966240733	I like Chris Christie, but we can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports Common Core.
0.0	0.302266787658	Again...
0.0	0.302266787658	So...
0.0	0.302296432818	That will change everything.
0.0	0.302460179903	So, let's not in anyway imply here that either President Obama or myself, would in anyway not take on any vested interested, whether it's Wall Street, or drug companies, or insurance companies, or frankly, the gun lobby to stand up to do what's best for the American people.
0.0	0.302481787918	Came out great.
0.0	0.302520357324	And right now, I will be putting up a tremendous -- so far, I've put up less than anybody and I have the best results.
0.0	0.302580980171	You know, I find it really quite fascinating some of the president's proclamations.
0.0	0.302611402212	It's not only a problem here.
0.0	0.302737083988	That is the fight we have to have, and we have to undo a whole set of things that President Obama has done that get at the heart of his disrespect and disregard for too many Americans.
1.0	0.302766083438	But I will -- but I will tell you this, the socialist says they're going to pay for everything and give you everything for free, except they don't say they're going to raise it through taxes to 90 percent to do it.
0.0	0.302888172987	They're sick of politics as usual.
0.0	0.30293067222	Let's let a Justice Department -- and I will make an attorney general who will enforce the law and make justice more than just a word.
0.0	0.303115985771	We have a lot of work to do with Iran before we ever say that they could move toward normalized relations with us.
0.0	0.303240473571	It's a simple formula: common sense regulations, which is why I think we should freeze all federal regulations for one year, except for health and safety.
0.0	0.303299692222	We need to take a new approach of taxing -- reforming how we tax, and reforming the regulations in our -- in our country before it's too late.
0.0	0.303492892703	All right, look, this has been a great debate.
0.0	0.303585538996	I do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination to succeed President Obama.
0.0	0.303701234709	... an agreement with the...
0.0	0.303777424194	Yeah, he said everybody.
0.0	0.303777864658	And sending that signal makes it impossible for us to be serious about taking out ISIS and restoring democracy in Syria.
0.0	0.303978944541	They go to Harvard.
0.0	0.304007768897	This is a bad deal.
0.0	0.30409770249	What we know is we're living longer.
0.0	0.304278890523	But I recall when Secretary Clinton ran against then-Senator Obama, she was critical of him for suggesting that maybe you want to talk to Iran, that you want to talk to our enemies.
0.0	0.304375803516	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, it is demonstrably true...
0.0	0.304477892579	And Carl -- Carl, I'm not finished yet.
0.0	0.304659432117	Look, here is the reality, folks.
0.0	0.304660056812	Their family is waiting for them.
0.0	0.304666719656	I would put it in a blind trust.
0.0	0.305051973303	And I will go back to Washington with my plan.
0.0	0.305202616035	It ain't going to happen.
0.0	0.305249342426	As far as the wall is concerned, we're going to build a wall.
0.0	0.305284354728	We don't need that.
0.0	0.305335310753	He needs to recognize that those kinds of things are in fact an existential threat to us.
0.0	0.305368749858	And -- and -- and I -- you know, Ben is absolutely right in saying that what we don't need to do is to send more money to Washington, D.C. to fix this problem.
0.0	0.305460677939	And recognizing that it's so important, this election, because we're talking about America for the people versus America for the government.
0.0	0.305468115993	And it has been a remarkable situation in our state.
0.0	0.305615112869	Well, that's a real question.
0.0	0.305752352309	We cannot elect somebody that doesn't know how to do the job.
0.0	0.305851010844	I'll tell you what else people are concerned about.
0.0	0.306123854388	You can call it visas, you can call it work permits, you can call it anything you want.
0.0	0.30616467384	There is a bill sitting in the House that would actually pass and have us go to zero-based budgeting so we know where every dime of your money is being spent instead of only talking about how much more we're going to spend year after year after year.
0.0	0.306749767115	They haven't done that.
0.0	0.306773605069	We'll go to the Congress.
0.0	0.30685638166	I will deliver for the American people if I have the privilege of leading this country.
0.0	0.306931441416	But the final thing I want to say about this is the following.
0.0	0.306990541999	Bipartisan issue.
0.0	0.307007487594	I can tell you, there wouldn't have been much damage.
0.0	0.307167714841	The answer is simple.
0.0	0.307191826226	You count on it.
0.0	0.307202644378	...Or, even some famous Colorado brownies.
0.0	0.307216330388	But I'm going to tell you the truth.
0.0	0.307487362377	And he got nasty.
0.0	0.307496625155	We have to offer a compelling alternative that is based on hope and optimism and grounded in serious policy, which I've laid out.
0.0	0.30758887348	I'm proud that I gave him that advice.
0.0	0.307655311334	Wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.307748299392	And, they're always going to say, "Well, we're going to fix this one day."
0.0	0.308114604398	We both have a lot of small donors.
0.0	0.308121479634	And, the only way -- no...
0.0	0.308243744915	That's what he is.
0.0	0.308330590144	It continues with regulatory reform.
0.0	0.308528407786	I believe that our Constitution protects everybody, regardless of their sexual orientation or any other aspect.
0.0	0.308540921295	There are a lot of people living paycheck to paycheck in Florida as well, they're looking for a senator that will fight for them each and every day.
0.0	0.308592307691	... his answer -- you name it.
0.0	0.308640049056	If I'm president, there won't be stupid deals anymore.
0.0	0.308652385539	I'm not -- my campaign is going to be about the future of America, it's not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage.
0.0	0.308968185916	And I also want to recognize the people in that church that showed the grace of God and the grace of forgiveness and the mercy that they showed.
0.0	0.309444112758	John, I'll tell you something.
0.0	0.309553457436	I'm very proud that NARAL endorsed me because when it comes to it we need a leader on women's issues.
0.0	0.309694705716	Mr. President, we're not against you.
0.0	0.309841288028	Enough on fantasy football.
0.0	0.310115184796	It's not fear and terror, it's reality.
0.0	0.310352472203	That is...
0.0	0.310387476982	Well, I mean right here.
0.0	0.310507546669	If I have a weakness, it's that I try to live by the rules.
0.0	0.310603353017	And we have to take properly vetted refugees ourselves.
0.0	0.310815755296	And, then we have to go after sentencing, and that's one of the problems here in Wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn't happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level.
0.0	0.310846568397	They're not my ideas, and I don't necessarily agree with all of them.
0.0	0.311002873556	In my case, whether it's health care, or getting us to debt-free tuition, or moving us toward paid family leave, I have been very specific about where I would raise the money, how much it would cost, and how I would move this agenda forward.
0.0	0.311279605425	And finally, on health care, why don't we start treating -- keep giving...
0.0	0.31137616989	You find me...
0.0	0.311466346313	He was kind of a conservative guy in many respects.
0.0	0.31151159967	It's the evil government that is -- that is putting all these regulations on us so that we can't survive.
0.0	0.311757741881	Nobody can solve it like me.
0.0	0.31175901446	I just want to thank all my colleagues here for being civil, and not falling for the traps.
1.0	0.311875588455	That's exactly what the Republican establishment says too.
0.0	0.311923967411	I want to go back for a second thought on this issue of income inequality.
0.0	0.312225636089	And then in addition to that, the American people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.312347587868	We will win on everything we do.
0.0	0.312610751843	Let's quit making it a problem for them.
0.0	0.312611629889	If I'm president of the United States and Congress tries to cut the military, I will veto that in a millisecond.
0.0	0.312695666242	The question always is, what works better, the private marketplace or government?
1.0	0.312913192248	It's not theirs anymore.
0.0	0.312914150612	And second, the international crisis we are facing is most dreadful and most dangerous.
0.0	0.312988599564	This is the fantasy...
0.0	0.312989293997	It will be a long day.
0.0	0.313043783687	So, let's stop fooling around about this, let's tell people the truth.
0.0	0.313058261621	We can take many of those same procedures, we can apply it to Medicare.
0.0	0.313095955793	I absolutely would call on them to collaborate and cooperate, yes.
0.0	0.313221785285	I do.
0.0	0.313221785285	I have.
0.0	0.313221785285	We do.
0.0	0.313221785285	You do.
0.0	0.313366898509	Right and left are spending us into oblivion.
0.0	0.313430480568	I know for a fact how difficult it is to raise children, how expensive it's become for working families.
0.0	0.313502837279	We need to make sure that we keep the country safe.
0.0	0.313579104862	So let's start by knowing where your money is being spent by the federal government.
0.0	0.313623024841	We're going to have a big, fat beautiful door right in the middle of the wall.
0.0	0.313743162839	That's just a fact, and that's what Donald Trump taps into.
0.0	0.313798385981	We need to be focusing on what fixes this country.
0.0	0.313938463957	And when FDR said, "Yeah, it is," that we're going to use all of the resources that we have to create jobs, to build homes, to feed people, to protect the farmers, we are a nation which if we come together there is nothing that we could not accomplish.
0.0	0.314107853625	Dynamically.
0.0	0.314161033604	Secondly, as it relates to Iran, we need to confront their ambitions across the board.
0.0	0.314181877312	You have small businesses in America that are struggling.
0.0	0.314341877008	And this is one of the myths that the left perpetrates on our society, and this is how they frighten people and get people to shut up.
0.0	0.314359228232	We have gutted our ability to detect the next attack.
0.0	0.314625958285	Are you fed up with how Washington wastes your money?
0.0	0.314628669569	You get the Congress.
0.0	0.314697015054	They have infrastructure.
0.0	0.314781370171	If there was a -- and you know I'm not bringing a suit.
0.0	0.314994705874	If we're gonna reform welfare for poor people, we ought to reform it for rich people, as well.
0.0	0.315016646445	I hope Congress says no to this deal.
0.0	0.315064171302	What I said was that I think that Dr. Carson's ideas are good ideas.
0.0	0.315356529345	We're going to have people come in, but they're coming in legally.
0.0	0.315375857471	When I'm president of the United States we are getting rid of Obamacare and we are rebuilding our military.
0.0	0.315377230053	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.315377230053	But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.
0.0	0.31537948055	If we do that again, we will lose again, we will deserve to lose again.
0.0	0.315549888491	I will tell you this, I will beat Hillary Clinton.
1.0	0.315623419168	You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don't agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements.
0.0	0.315685644697	I don't think it's a war on women for all of us as Americans to stand up and stop harvesting organs from little babies.
0.0	0.315862849938	And this is not an endeavor that rewards that.
0.0	0.315899595087	is exactly the leadership we need in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.316045050411	Let me tell you, if we don't get this election right, there may be no turning back for America.
0.0	0.316257101658	I have Ivanka, and Eric and Don sitting there.
0.0	0.316278651116	But getting back to Martha's question about how we end dependency, do we have to have a cultural change?
0.0	0.316510129608	And yes, it was a very difficult time.
0.0	0.31661318295	First and foremost, this issue has to be now more than anything else about keeping America safe.
0.0	0.316633385343	I got the briefings.
0.0	0.316665691562	I'm going to prioritize those recipients who need the most help first.
0.0	0.316924613486	Wall Street is doing great.
0.0	0.316946921326	They're concerned that Washington is so dysfunctional it is holding them back.
0.0	0.317044765762	This is a guy who just believes that law enforcement are the bad guys.
0.0	0.317158690447	But what happened is a political vacuum developed.
0.0	0.31726797184	Our next president...
0.0	0.317306805587	Well, there is no evidence that they can fix anything in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.317388189922	Do people not care about all of our sacrifice?
0.0	0.317652888702	She was right.
0.0	0.317687105814	She'd be a great president of the United States because the leadership she brought to H.P.
0.0	0.317826639999	Oh, well, you know, it just didn't work out for you.
0.0	0.317838577801	We have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone.
0.0	0.317924224066	What we need now is a proven leader who has produced results.
0.0	0.317929397191	And it is difficult to in any way argue with the goal that we both share.
0.0	0.317943133596	I want security.
0.0	0.318173534135	Let's talk about our campaigns.
0.0	0.318426188841	I do not see -- want to see one parent or loved one worrying about getting a call in the middle of the night.
0.0	0.318602818211	That's was hard work.
0.0	0.318645260244	We ought to give them a little bit of a liability release so that they share data amongst themselves and share data with the federal government, they're not fearful of a lawsuit.
0.0	0.318702660047	The American people are never going to trust Washington, D.C., and for good reason.
0.0	0.318866083647	Well, you know what?
0.0	0.319038998666	It is.
0.0	0.319139021566	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.319139021566	And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.
0.0	0.319302797558	The fact is, the reason why...
0.0	0.319475459581	Look, we have to stop with political correctness.
0.0	0.31959519213	A lot of interesting issues have come together.
0.0	0.319855830529	If you're not willing to do that, nobody wants to do it, but if you're not willing to gradually raise the age, you're not serious about fixing either one of them.
0.0	0.319960995833	We're going to let people in, but they're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.319979284085	You look at California, you look, frankly, at Paris where there's a -- the strictest no-gun policy of any city anywhere in the world, and you see what happens: 130 people dead with many to follow.
0.0	0.320015971724	And they will work with me to get comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.320026384735	Get over that one, OK?
0.0	0.320192175076	I guess just for the fun of it; they want to throw money around.
0.0	0.320209063723	And -- and -- and the last piece of this, Maria, is this.
0.0	0.320223633601	Conservatives, I am a conservative because I believe no one of us is any better than any other one of us.
0.0	0.320254607584	I will be the Ronald Reagan if I can find a Tip O'Neill.
1.0	0.320441070504	He has called him a disappointment.
0.0	0.320643513497	The Koch Brothers have a very clear political agenda.
0.0	0.32067364802	We need to re-establish the relationships with the Sunnis.
0.0	0.320720334642	Both served.
0.0	0.32085827212	You don't have to guess about it, because I actually have a record.
0.0	0.320875446095	And you better get rid of them because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
0.0	0.320879831793	When you look at raising the debt limit, it should be leverage to try to reform government.
0.0	0.321056945318	I'd say, "General, enforce the law against everyone justly, fairly, and aggressively.
0.0	0.321148088486	And it's something that can be done, and I get questioned about that.
0.0	0.321156712425	I don't -- look, I don't think anybody should be expanding Medicaid.
0.0	0.321186774367	But judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.321194704885	You know, a lot of business activity in America is conducted like the guy that does my dry cleaning.
0.0	0.3212104845	We need security.
0.0	0.321241103385	And there should be some regulation.
0.0	0.321260380828	He might not take my phone call, but he would get the message, and the message is this: Until you open every nuclear and every military facility to full, open, anytime/anywhere, for real, inspections, we are going to make it as difficult as possible for you to move money around the global financial system.
0.0	0.321264764984	You didn't see it for a minute.
0.0	0.321474262156	They have a sophisticated understanding of our legal immigration system and we now have an obligation to ensure that they are not able to use that system against us.
0.0	0.321511437141	And when America does not lead, the world is a dangerous and a tragic place.
0.0	0.321717543693	No.
0.0	0.321717543693	No.
0.0	0.321717543693	No.
0.0	0.321717543693	No.
0.0	0.321717543693	No.
0.0	0.321717543693	No.
0.0	0.321717543693	No.
0.0	0.321717543693	No.
0.0	0.321807244154	At least he's honest enough to call himself a socialist.
0.0	0.322051767771	Freedom is personal for me, and I will always keep my word and fight for freedom.
0.0	0.322114936383	And if we want to try to rebuild the coalition, as Governor Kasich was saying before, then what we better do is to get to the Arab countries that believe that ISIS is a threat, not only to them, but to us and to world peace, and bring them together.
0.0	0.322159516426	You're not interested in an answer.
0.0	0.322432868652	Let me say on that...
0.0	0.322433177027	You're an American, as is everybody else on this stage, and I would suggest we focus on who's best prepared to be commander- in-chief, because that's the most important question facing the country.
0.0	0.322711916821	We have Dodd-Frank.
0.0	0.323008162865	That is not what America is supposed to be about.
0.0	0.323169273803	So yes, you're going to hear a lot of talk about tax reform --
0.0	0.323371222668	The more the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected are advantaged.
0.0	0.323372121266	It is hard to find someone in my generation that thinks Social Security will be there for us.
0.0	0.323592733745	That is like shouting "fire" in a crowded theater, and that is illegal, and I would do everything in our power not just to go after those who are here who we know who are here, before they can radicalize other Americans to carry out attacks, and it's not just the ones they've arrested.
0.0	0.323608384757	A brief response.
0.0	0.323756392343	I'd like to just mention something about my tax plan, and how it relates to the discussion...
0.0	0.323840024759	What would motivate me and what would be the guiding light for me in terms of immigration reform, Judy, is to bring families together, not divide them up.
0.0	0.323978803362	You target the bad guys.
0.0	0.324002919594	It appears that the same someone who has been whispering in old Marco's ear too.
0.0	0.324329508408	I think, though, government is too big now.
0.0	0.324478071514	For a start, the secretary and I disagree -- and I think the president does not agree with her -- in terms of the concept of a no-fly zone in Syria.
0.0	0.324693799955	But on this point, if I may add something on this point.
0.0	0.324713769871	It'll be a pretty busy day, but that Iran negotiation is going to be torn up on day one.
0.0	0.32473374104	So I know Secretary Kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease-fire up as quickly as possible.
0.0	0.324752635338	Could I -- could I bring something up here, because I'm a constituent of the senator and I helped him and I expected that he would do constituent service, which means that he shows up to work.
0.0	0.324906721536	Well, a couple of things.
0.0	0.325303317905	(inaudible).
0.0	0.325371133342	It's got great people, it's got loving people, wonderful people.
0.0	0.32577397992	They go to Princeton.
0.0	0.326137225314	And I feel very strongly that I have an agenda, I have a record that really does respond to a lot of the specific needs that the women in our country face.
0.0	0.326216303589	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.326216303589	I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.
0.0	0.326249956013	(APPLAUSE) This is not a cage match.
0.0	0.326361935296	I'll suggest a part of that was his celebrity.
0.0	0.326376467355	I've tried to be as specific to answer questions so that my proposals can be vetted, because I feel like we have to level with people for the very reason, Gwen, that you are mentioning.
0.0	0.326630021464	We have a president of the United States that is undermining this country's security and expanding the role of...
0.0	0.326684931596	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.3269307736	It is Iran that's the expansionist power.
0.0	0.326963314954	Let me say first that it is disturbing that every time one of these home-grown terrorist attacks occurs, and, as your question points out, they are occurring with far too great frequency, it turns out we had warning signals.
0.0	0.32700269805	You know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money.
0.0	0.327069922922	Let me tell you, everybody, when they say they want to give it to you for free, keep your hands on your wallets because they're coming to you to pay for it.
0.0	0.327137500147	Too often, they give up, they negotiate with themselves.
0.0	0.327282058979	It's fine if they come in, but they have to come in legally.
0.0	0.327349979917	A lot has happened in nine months.
0.0	0.327444829853	We're going to create a border.
0.0	0.327530531985	And where we are right now is we have got to stand up to the Trumps of the world who are trying to divide us up.
0.0	0.327646479541	Carl said, "no, no -- " but he's somebody -- these are the kind of people that we should use to negotiate and not the China people that we have who are political hacks who don't know what they're doing and we have problems like this.
0.0	0.327712953919	And he said, oh, I'm never going to attack.
0.0	0.327951033581	I'm going to go to the commanders and say give me a plan to win.
0.0	0.328015806614	That's why I ask for your support for president.
0.0	0.328077913492	It's going to happen in this country, there are going to be further attacks.
0.0	0.328078018796	So if you're having Medicare for all, single-payer, you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing.
0.0	0.328101158117	But you ought to acknowledge the government doesn't do a very good job at it.
0.0	0.328119450439	It's not the evil rich people.
0.0	0.328147264551	Finally, we'll take off the political handcuffs.
0.0	0.328178059665	We're not going to solve this problem with traditional politics.
0.0	0.328188562515	We need to make sure that we do everything across all kinds of energy: natural gas, oil, absolutely.
0.0	0.328227941524	But Iran is at the heart of most of the evil that is going on in the Middle East through their proxies.
0.0	0.328365135477	We need to stop that.
0.0	0.328429210056	Neil, I was mentioned too.
0.0	0.328497613735	When you're a governor, you're held accountable for everything you do.
0.0	0.32855970758	And not only did I fight them and win, I lived to tell about it and I'm standing on this stage tonight as evidence of that.
0.0	0.328868976258	It's never been that way in American politics before.
0.0	0.328882047165	No, no.
0.0	0.328926927823	Come on, that's just not -- you scare senior citizens with that.
0.0	0.329056851039	One of them being that if you don't have some agreement within the system from states and from families and from students, it's hard to get to where we need to go.
0.0	0.329174393448	Are you concerned like I am that the debt and deficits of Washington, D.C. are endangering America's future?
0.0	0.329323490964	That sounds like a long time ago.
0.0	0.329323872378	And if we capture any of them alive, they are getting a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know.
0.0	0.329433294535	Well, let me just -- let me just say, once again...
0.0	0.329494167052	Not the change we need at a time we need it.
0.0	0.329498854336	Can we stop?
0.0	0.329598416825	Carl, are we really talking about getting government involved in fantasy football?
0.0	0.329604597991	Well, let's go with three.
0.0	0.32989352532	We both agree that we have to get unaccountable money out of our political system and that we have to do much more to ensure that Wall Street never wrecks main street again.
0.0	0.329965028256	And the problem today is there's no confidence in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.330504280563	I say, yes, not only do we give them what they need, but we don't tie their hands behind their backs so that they can go ahead and get the job done.
0.0	0.330747477296	I have fought my entire life to make sure that healthcare is a right for all people.
0.0	0.330798976611	That makes no sense to everybody.
0.0	0.330924562241	You know, America doesn't owe me anything.
0.0	0.330939655009	So if you happen to be right, you could get the top job at the end of the day.
0.0	0.330978880885	We're going to be actually out there trying to create a better life for hard-working Americans.
0.0	0.331021138635	And the reason -- and the reason...
0.0	0.331028884246	Everyone up here tonight that's talking about reforms, I think and I know for myself I speak to this, we're all talking about reforms for future generations.
0.0	0.331209241678	And, this is what I am finding throughout America.
0.0	0.331225893766	You see what the Saudi's -- deliver them a strong message but at the end of the day we have to keep our cool because most of the time they're going right with us.
0.0	0.331284351164	But, you know what we're not telling them?
0.0	0.331425535002	They're going to come in legally.
0.0	0.331463310948	We can make a stronger program.
0.0	0.331596967763	I am a little skeptical about your governor actually caring enough about higher education to make any kind of commitment like that.
0.0	0.331780139782	They should be running all the time, then they won't have time to plan attacks against us.
0.0	0.331848995171	And we finally need to tackle the basics to cut this government down to size and hold it accountable.
0.0	0.331914080255	We need sound money.
0.0	0.331914080255	We need sound money.
0.0	0.331927743111	But in 2015, we have a very different economy.
0.0	0.332219823055	We need to be on the side that keeps Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.332529634173	You've got to give people hope.
0.0	0.332738523237	Let me (inaudible).
0.0	0.332790016574	Not -- not on that, no.
0.0	0.33292399512	So I have voiced criticisms.
0.0	0.333007366178	Martha, religious liberty doesn't include encouraging a fellow American to engage in violent jihad and kill an American here.
0.0	0.333024524736	It will cause the economy to grow, to explode, to create more jobs.
0.0	0.33331949961	No their not.
0.0	0.333572879802	I believe in the PTT because it's important those countries in Asia are interfacing against China.
0.0	0.33359241412	This will end.
0.0	0.333745075044	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.333745075044	And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.
0.0	0.333909560685	Somebody who, yes, votes right, but much more than that, leads the efforts to protect the hard-fought gains that women have made, that, make no mistake about it, are under tremendous attack, not just by the Republican presidential candidates but by a whole national effort to try to set back women's rights.
0.0	0.334006170416	And that doesn't have to be true.
0.0	0.334231632385	And if we try to put everybody in the same -- call everybody the same thing, we can't do it.
0.0	0.334429217318	We'd rebuild infrastructure that would also create jobs in this country, and we'd work with the states to do it the right way, to do it more efficiently and more effectively.
0.0	0.33455606546	That's a dictatorship.
0.0	0.334573864937	We'll just clean it up.
0.0	0.334698900838	And, the fact is, none of them.
0.0	0.334797037146	And I have a road map and a plan right now to get us to balance.
0.0	0.33481899106	And I'm saying we have to get to the bottom of it.
0.0	0.334986580922	But I want to start by helping those people who are most at risk, the ones who, yes, are cutting their pills in half, who don't believe they can make the rent, who are worried about what comes next for them.
0.0	0.334989249352	Now, he's doing better.
0.0	0.335029435127	Why in God's name does Wall Street...
0.0	0.335241716269	John, could I follow up on this?
0.0	0.335253699443	I try to live by the rules, no matter what they are, and I was brought up that way as a kid.
0.0	0.335254542925	And I will have done it within 100 days, and it will pass.
0.0	0.335467025219	Everybody on this stage is better than Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.335631779088	Well, let me tell you this.
0.0	0.335807223512	My father used to say, "Johnny, we never -- we don't hate the rich.
0.0	0.335845826066	If you make your president, I'm going to put the country ahead of the party.
0.0	0.336026456425	That's a blessing.
0.0	0.336452367111	Anybody who tells me that we need every penny and every one of those is in a fantasy world.
0.0	0.336511144137	The fact is, in order to get this economy moving again, I call for freezing regulations for a year except for the problem of public safety.
0.0	0.336846879066	Well, the deal was done.
0.0	0.336984046855	They believe some are smarter than others, some are better than others, so some are going to need to take care of others.
0.0	0.337048197918	Listen, in any Republican primary, everyone is going to say they support the Second Amendment.
0.0	0.337056444144	And we need to bring our debt under control, make our economy stronger.
0.0	0.337167259732	My sister was a single mom, both of my aunts who were a single moms.
0.0	0.337382103974	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.337382103974	She sees her health insurance going up.
0.0	0.337449777799	It can not be someone that agrees with his agenda.
0.0	0.337846245772	We need a fighter for this country again.
0.0	0.33789258105	That's what he talked about, the great threat of China.
0.0	0.338107615752	They cause dishonesty.
0.0	0.338152913874	And that problem is too big regulations like the EPA, too much new taxes on business that we have seen and "Obamacare."
0.0	0.338205151828	But I think to suggest that I have voiced criticism, this blurb that you talk about, you know what the blurb said?
0.0	0.338378749975	And I give you my word, if I am elected president, no service man or service woman will be forced to be on their knees, and any nation that captures our fighting men will feel the full force and fury of the United States of America.
0.0	0.338391940096	Since he brought me up, do I not get to respond?
0.0	0.338424937518	Thanks for coming back to me, Maria.
0.0	0.338429950356	And it's available on paperback, if you're interested in buying my book.
0.0	0.33857262497	Super PACs are a disaster.
0.0	0.338673811938	I'd also go after these sanctuary cities, do everything we can to make sure that we are not -- that we are actually prosecuting and cutting off funding for cities that are harboring illegal aliens, and then finally making sure the IRS is not going after conservative or religious groups.
0.0	0.338763169575	Now, I'm the only person that's put out a detailed plan on how to deal with entitlements.
0.0	0.338898212069	... replacing dependency with opportunity.
0.0	0.338930448772	It's a blessing that we're living longer, so we have to increase the retirement age to reflect that blessing.
0.0	0.338954959701	Maybe you haven't.
0.0	0.338978905683	We need to be very well aware of the fact that China and Russia are using technology to attack us, just as ISIS is using technology to recruit those who would murder American citizens.
0.0	0.339120703996	It's harder to talk to your enemies.
0.0	0.339176685002	If we don't stop them over there, they are coming here just as sure as I stand here in front of you.
0.0	0.339377382386	This is 2016.
0.0	0.339488628023	If they can't regulate themselves, then the NFL needs to look at just, you know, moving away from them a little bit.
0.0	0.33952981577	And we need to do that throughout the country.
0.0	0.339593193192	The fact that it's happened for so many people here throughout our history, that's what makes us special.
0.0	0.339761962267	Just want to get that out there, just saying.
0.0	0.339860903474	You know, I listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas.
0.0	0.339928723505	I have many friends that deal with China.
0.0	0.340080394825	We have to continue to work with the Iraqi army so that they are better prepared to advance on some of the other strongholds inside Iraq, like Mosul, when they are able to do so.
0.0	0.340181614505	But now as I travel the country, people say what I feel.
0.0	0.340291600608	You want to fix Medicare?
0.0	0.34044404659	Japan, the same thing.
0.0	0.340593131325	Are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the Assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire?
0.0	0.34062948986	The only way to figure that out is to go back to getting the intelligence community the funding and the tools that it needs to be able to keep America safe.
0.0	0.340868776679	I don't care.
0.0	0.341009814176	I asked my dad after -- obviously, when I found out about this.
1.0	0.341093919269	He said, "we don't have leverage with China to get a better deal on Iran because we need them to lend us money to continue operating our government."
0.0	0.341110815845	This is one of the great tragedies in our country today.
0.0	0.341149133671	Think back to Garland, Texas.
0.0	0.341366061132	Becky --
0.0	0.34146914455	I'm going to keep making sure that everything I've done, everything that I stand for is going to be well known.
0.0	0.341544606102	I think we're on the verge of the greatest time, and I want to fix the things to let people rise up.
0.0	0.341641142833	You can trust me to do the following: that when I get on change with Hillary Clinton, we won't be debating about the science, we'll be debating about the solutions.
0.0	0.341644563288	I think, actually, people are looking for that in Washington now.
0.0	0.341815552471	Reforms, everything from moral and cultural issues to economic issues.
0.0	0.342063337288	And I was proud to stand with him and support it.
0.0	0.342320442491	First, rather than expand benefits for everyone, I do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs.
0.0	0.3423422392	And I say that to Nikki.
0.0	0.342395316492	So there are people watching tonight in business.
0.0	0.342557970701	Here's the bottom line, and I'll close with this.
0.0	0.342639757202	And I'm going to do everything I can to address distressed communities, whether they are communities of color, whether they are white communities, whether they are in any part of our country.
0.0	0.342707823132	We're gutting our military, and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were.
0.0	0.342904753046	And I think Ted Kennedy had a very clear idea about what needed to be done.
0.0	0.342982678331	We don't win.
0.0	0.343135330249	Our vets are being treated horribly.
0.0	0.34340576009	That's not true.
0.0	0.343541125187	So I'm going to come up with the best way forward.
0.0	0.343619271655	If a soldier has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.34385541235	I am not a member of the political class.
0.0	0.344126703608	Well, I've learned the rules on this.
0.0	0.344133129086	And so when we talk to our allies and we give them our word, in a Christie administration, they know we're going to keep it.
0.0	0.344162563753	... wants to face Donald Trump in the general election.
0.0	0.344213447878	Look, the truth is that a powerful nation like the United States, certainly working with our allies, we can overthrow dictators all over the world.
0.0	0.344229205441	Well, I respectfully disagree.
0.0	0.344279475789	So I would -- I would be willing to do that.
0.0	0.344351139115	They are worried to death about the future of their kids.
0.0	0.344363771618	And I will assure you, as the governor of the state of Texas, and as those last four years have shown me, the preparation to be ready to stand on this stage and talk about those monetary policies, those domestic policies, and those foreign policies, Americans are going to see that I am ready to be that individual.
0.0	0.34450145648	We have got to destroy their training camps over there before they can attack us here.
0.0	0.344516957695	And what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice.
0.0	0.344935977757	I'll tell them that we're going to grow the economy so that we can give people better opportunities so they don't have to rely exclusively on benefit types of programs.
0.0	0.344965314104	You know, that's so simple.
0.0	0.345087195997	Judgment matters as well.
0.0	0.345221584418	The millionaires and billionaires are doing great under Obama.
0.0	0.345275896473	I believe I can get the money that I need by taxing the wealthy, by closing loopholes, the things that we are way overdue for doing.
0.0	0.345318374929	We're nowhere close to a balanced budget or fiscal discipline.
0.0	0.345343178384	Sometimes you win a war by killing murderous, evil terrorists.
0.0	0.345457032565	It's not only offensive; it's dangerous.
0.0	0.345604242248	But what he's touching -- talking about, I think has got merit.
0.0	0.345698118499	His first election and his re-election.
0.0	0.34575155054	According to the FBI and the director of national intelligence, Syria's becoming a perfect platform to strike our nation.
0.0	0.34576116025	Watching this broadcast tonight are millions of people that are living paycheck to paycheck.
0.0	0.345926236962	But we're running for the presidency of the United States here.
0.0	0.345961942154	And we're letting them get away with it and we can't let them get away with it.
0.0	0.346143007788	We've worked hard our whole life to provide a better family -- a better life for our family.
0.0	0.346173496974	I've seen plenty of other people follow up?
0.0	0.34618502215	That is why there is massive despair all over this country.
0.0	0.346280028612	Not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.346519051491	It goes away.
0.0	0.346558461486	And yes, I was fired over a disagreement in the boardroom.
0.0	0.346912621434	I will run on my record all day long.
0.0	0.347098303987	This issue is not about that anymore.
0.0	0.347172260913	I was governor on September 11th, and I'm proud of my leadership in bringing New York through that time.
0.0	0.347242187175	But the voters are savvier than that.
0.0	0.347259862241	Why don't you wait in line?
0.0	0.347265622052	There is a better way to provide health care.
0.0	0.347302761242	Target the efforts for people that are committing crimes with guns, and if you do that, and get it right, you're going to be much better off than creating a political argument where there's a big divide.
0.0	0.347310132155	We're running.
0.0	0.347334605414	But the Democrats are going to bring a lawsuit, and you have to have certainty.
0.0	0.347530765564	When you became president, you had a Democratic Congress and a filibuster-proof Democratic Senate.
0.0	0.347674879596	Well, I'm just not sure I agree completely with that assessment.
0.0	0.34770557763	That is not protected religious belief.
0.0	0.347728170424	But the leaders have come forward to realize that protest is fine, but violence is wrong.
0.0	0.348027688489	Well, obviously, you don't understand my views on homosexuality.
0.0	0.348230491746	And I recognize -- I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa.
0.0	0.348369888344	Well, there is no question that some people go overboard when it comes to trying to make profits, and they don't take into consideration the American people.
0.0	0.348372021221	Well, I think, Judy, what has to be appreciated is that, as a result of the disastrous and illegal behavior on Wall Street, millions of lives were hurt.
0.0	0.348448071205	You have a big lawsuit over your head while you're running.
0.0	0.348682841642	Sometimes it's a complicated situation, but some things are black and white.
0.0	0.348769079578	If you get caught abusing this program, you should never be able to use it again.
0.0	0.348866495094	When it comes to ISIS, we will not weaken them, we will not degrade them, we will utterly and completely destroy ISIS
0.0	0.348924274912	It's the people that pull the trigger and we have to find out what is going on.
0.0	0.349066650069	We have the Russians and the Iranians working together, not to fight ISIS, but to prop up Assad.
0.0	0.349079546247	And that's why 2016 is a turning point in our history.
0.0	0.349115424982	On the issue of Barack Obama, Barack Obama does not believe that America is a great global power.
0.0	0.349212476568	Their kids are having a hard time finding any work at all.
0.0	0.349238964291	Neil, Neil -- can I say one thing about this.
0.0	0.349322891426	I don't like that.
0.0	0.349322891426	They don't like that.
0.0	0.349452105306	And I'm going to tell you, that it -- I'm going to suggest to you here tonight, that you can't do on the job training.
0.0	0.349526215278	He is the party's frontrunner right now, and good for him.
0.0	0.349578115651	Wait a minute, who in their 16th month?
0.0	0.349599513655	First of all, yes, we've stolen.
0.0	0.349774866082	We're becoming Greece if we don't work together.
0.0	0.349947605392	And, people are sick of believing that the government is never going to really address this.
0.0	0.349984117107	So I'm going to keep making that case.
1.0	0.35025679191	Becky, it is the height of hypocrisy for Mrs. Clinton to talk about being the first woman President, when every single policy she espouses, and every single policy of President Obama has been demonstrably bad for women.
0.0	0.350269701485	I am, but people are upset, and they're upset for a reason about the future of this country.
0.0	0.350286695691	Where did that spirit come from in America?
0.0	0.350312508191	So, are we going to ban Muslims from India, from Indonesia, from countries that are strong allies -- that we need to build better relationships with?
0.0	0.350560489894	It's not constitutional.
0.0	0.350585060654	We need to have some coalitions in that part of the world to go after ISIS, but we also need to send a clear message.
0.0	0.35060247905	The fact of the matter is we're not going to have peace -- we are not going to have peace in Syria.
0.0	0.35065327609	They know that this country is pushing the middle class, the hardworking taxpayers, backwards, and they saw a president who doesn't understand their pain, and doesn't have any plan for getting away from it.
0.0	0.35081816354	We now have much more information about what must be done to fix our criminal justice system.
0.0	0.350972434727	They do it to us, we don't it.
0.0	0.350999096639	And that's what I'll offer to the people of the United States in this candidacy for the presidency.
0.0	0.351112632553	That's not the America that I've ever known.
0.0	0.351233335966	...is paid -- played fairly.
0.0	0.351303772434	Do we still have values and principles?
0.0	0.351342000381	So what if mass unemployment exists?
0.0	0.351411385958	I hope you will make a decision soon on this.
0.0	0.351723799164	I think he has addressed a lot of these issues that have been quite difficult, but he has gone forward.
0.0	0.351861886152	China and Russia have never been on our side of the table.
0.0	0.351896372953	We need to rebuild our military, and this president has let it diminish to a point where tinpot dictators like the mullahs in Iran are taking our Navy ships.
0.0	0.352165552326	It's not supposed to happen that way.
0.0	0.352411519191	He has got -- that is why he is on the end.
0.0	0.352567545133	The natural next question is who actually has done so.
0.0	0.352629020363	What have you got now?
0.0	0.352759044173	This is the first priority.
0.0	0.352893624509	If she gets elected, she's under investigation with the FBI right now.
0.0	0.353022443814	The problem is we never get it done.
0.0	0.353186081183	The fact is, there's a number of things that the next president is going to have to do to clean up this mess.
0.0	0.353223125378	It's not that complicated actually.
0.0	0.35325000187	... on the issue of citizenship, Donald, I'm not going to use your mother's birth against you.
0.0	0.353282284968	I know some people like to say, "well, this is free money."
0.0	0.353379613034	These are drags on the economy, it's a deliberate drag.
0.0	0.35343291246	Well, Senator, look, I think we're in vigorous agreement here.
0.0	0.353487943748	Ohio, one of the best growing places in the country -- I not only did it in Washington, I did it in Ohio, and I'll go back to Washington, and there will be no more silly deals...
0.0	0.353845244123	It was.
0.0	0.353845244123	You did.
0.0	0.353920046575	As far as Mark is concerned, as far as the visas are concerned, if we need people, they have -- it's fine.
0.0	0.35412795082	The last thing we need is to throw our country into a contentious debate about health care again.
0.0	0.354180802536	OK. You know, you judge a nation not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how you treat, we treat, the most vulnerable and fragile people in our nation.
0.0	0.3542010586	It turns out some dot wasn't connected, and so the first thing we have to do is make sure that everyone and every responsible agency is attuned to all of these possibilities and symptoms.
0.0	0.354234049439	Socialist and government dependent.
0.0	0.35424771445	I mean the fact is, is that they need to put the pressure on and frankly we need to intercepts ships coming out of North Korea so they don't proliferate all these dangerous materials.
0.0	0.354331090311	And to expand on Mr. Carson's -- or Dr. Carson's question, let's face it, we have laws already.
0.0	0.354374209175	Two quick responses.
0.0	0.354436925239	You get, like, three days where you have to show up?
0.0	0.354479006916	But realistically, even if they do, the money is flowing.
0.0	0.354785314174	Let me tell you who Larry Tribe is.
0.0	0.354908687979	And his explanation -- he said, "look, I'm from New York, that's what we believe in New York.
0.0	0.355032049919	It is time for Republicans in D.C. to fight.
0.0	0.355108350503	John, I'd like to address this?
0.0	0.355147746448	They're protectionist.
0.0	0.355155837296	We need fundamental police reform, clearly, clearly, when we talk about a criminal justice system.
0.0	0.355225125815	We have this enormous mismatch because we have smaller and smaller families.
0.0	0.355378144729	And as president, I will rebuild the military and keep this country safe.
0.0	0.355399541244	If an American missionary has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.355974759845	It's a private-sector solution that believes in freedom, not Obamacare that believes in government control.
0.0	0.356191959975	And you're not serious about destroying ISIL.
0.0	0.356208983416	I know every one.
0.0	0.356209349863	So look, in foreign policy -- in foreign policy, it's strength, but you've got to be cool.
0.0	0.356296902898	And you think about the reasons that we're having such difficulty right now with our job market.
0.0	0.356363000357	Ben Carson, can you do math?
0.0	0.35665560486	We haven't done so.
0.0	0.356713045727	And we just got to make sure that every American has the tools, in K-through-12 and in vocational education, in higher education.
0.0	0.356920062982	That's not the role of the government.
0.0	0.356975115722	That has not been...
0.0	0.35699992812	Manufacturing will flow back into this country.
0.0	0.357004551265	Does he stand up for law enforcement?
0.0	0.357101705259	But the facts and the law here are really quite clear.
0.0	0.357164472236	That's the establishment telling us to hide our conservative principles to get the left and the media to like us.
0.0	0.357196452348	But it is a general economic issue.
0.0	0.357235402875	What kind of signal does that send to the rest of the world that the United States is a serious player in creating peace and security?
0.0	0.357330100366	This is the fantasy that I talked about in the beginning.
0.0	0.357337492836	The reason all of us are here is we believe we should be fighting for the working men and women of this country, and not Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.357347027466	QUICK: Governor, thank you.
0.0	0.357408089279	Well, first, Judy, I have spent my entire adult life working toward making sure that women are empowered to make their own choices, even if that choice is not to vote for me.
0.0	0.357666600622	I would just say that...
0.0	0.358056780017	Let's talk about something that happened this week in the news.
0.0	0.358170885667	And, sometimes we're held up in contempt by people who write columns, but, I guarantee you to every person on this stage there's something deep inside of us that would cause us to give up our livelihoods and step out on this stage and fight for the people of America.
0.0	0.358361825568	The time to act is now.
0.0	0.358482792564	You know, I sat down with the senior leadership of John Deere.
0.0	0.358529321783	The fact of the matter is he doesn't realize that we now live in the 21st century, and that war is very different than it used to be before.
0.0	0.358759179614	Donald is right that China is running over President Obama like he is a child, President Obama is not protecting American workers and we are getting hammered.
0.0	0.359010530882	It isn't "I put money in, I'm getting it back."
0.0	0.359116218557	Run the company kids, have a good time.
0.0	0.359232575542	Yes, our allies are not perfect.
0.0	0.35931105913	Those are the things we brought, and we were able to get things done.
0.0	0.359341947289	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.359341947289	Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?
0.0	0.359469310268	Let me just -- just say this.
0.0	0.359558254099	Because it wouldn't work.
0.0	0.359851987336	You know, a minute ago, Neil asked: What has President Obama do -- done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns?
0.0	0.359861710936	We are not France.
0.0	0.360035480737	We have Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view.
0.0	0.360069593903	We are not the world's policeman, but we need to stand up and be ready.
0.0	0.360133353796	We need to bring people together in Washington.
0.0	0.360144887366	That's gonna be the real growth engine.
0.0	0.360199967668	And let me make a final point on this.
0.0	0.360257820707	You know, I think my biggest weakness is exactly the opposite.
0.0	0.360366124087	You're going away for a long, long while.
0.0	0.360379152056	We need to embed with -- with the Iraqi military.
0.0	0.36040458665	And when the president of the United States gets out to speak about it, does he support police officers?
0.0	0.360632815798	We need to make the government run smarter and better, and reform this corporate tax system, bring that money back to the United States to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, and we need to use it also to protect our grid from terrorists.
0.0	0.360648582067	Well, you know, I think, from a historical point of view, somebody with my background, somebody with my views, somebody who has spent his entire life taking on the big money interests, I think a Sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment, as well.
0.0	0.360654379681	I stood on the stage and watched Marco in rather indignantly, look at Governor Bush and say, someone told you that because we're running for the same office, that criticizing me will get you to that office.
0.0	0.360693690738	But bottom line is: The president is right.
0.0	0.360707142905	They have got to quit trying to ship rockets into Gaza that can be used against Israel.
0.0	0.360930270193	And that's what we have to contrast.
0.0	0.36116135153	Our decision is, then, do we give them what we need.
0.0	0.361245146301	I have no clue whether the federal government is the proper place, my instinct is to say, hell no, just about everything about the federal government.
0.0	0.361253290316	Yes, I believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on Wall Street, that they are a Wall Street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession -- Great Depression.
0.0	0.361469414466	But Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term, and you should be showing up to work.
0.0	0.361564640535	But let me say one more thing.
0.0	0.361592352701	I think maybe my greatest weakness is that I trust people too much.
0.0	0.361617396277	No, you did.
0.0	0.361661471279	There's no way he launches 11 attack --
0.0	0.362037969543	You do the arithmetic.
0.0	0.362153322253	They are devaluing -- it's so impossible for -- you look at Caterpillar Tractor and what's happening with Caterpillar and Kamatsu (ph).
0.0	0.362279518019	Yes, they have to stop trying to destabilize the Middle East, causing even more chaos.
0.0	0.362472433915	The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, the slower the economy becomes.
0.0	0.362501798604	We're seeing it in my state and we'll see it in this country.
0.0	0.36326413817	And the fact is those jobs are critical, they're hard working members of the middle class and they need to be paid attention to because they're Americans and they carry the load.
0.0	0.363388773012	I will spend every ounce of energy to stop it.
0.0	0.363396766658	They're a feeding frenzy for sick people.
0.0	0.363656935797	They know we will be committed to victory.
0.0	0.363710967376	It should be what are your substantive positions...
0.0	0.363742308472	But everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro- gay-marriage, focus around money and the media.
0.0	0.36408328319	Much of the discussion is centered over whether or not the different tax plans help, or affect the middle class.
0.0	0.364127513447	Those are two leaders that I admire very much.
0.0	0.36418824701	Young people for whom getting involved in politics is as, you know, it's like going to the moon.
0.0	0.364253903629	We can get back in the game to restore order and security for our own country.
0.0	0.36450840385	We need all of them to be part of exactly what the first George Bush put together in the first Gulf War.
0.0	0.364513863644	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the free enterprise system.
0.0	0.364656426354	We will work with our Sunni allies.
0.0	0.364670627778	You know, some of these -- these engagement rules that the administration has -- "we're not going to bomb a tanker that's coming out of there because there might be a person in it" -- give me a break.
0.0	0.364897883666	We both want to get more revenue in.
0.0	0.365042009654	We have a world that's out of control and has grown dangerous and a president that is weakening our military and making our foreign policy unstable and unreliable in the eyes of our allies.
0.0	0.365157886595	The better way of dealing with this -- the better way of dealing with this is recognizing that there are people in, you know, the -- Islamic terrorists inside, embedded in refugee populations.
0.0	0.365244198006	Bill, I want to say one more thing about...
0.0	0.365305344815	And as president I would expand enormous energy, literally call every member of Congress that I thought I could persuade.
0.0	0.365351136667	We've already got a great talker in the White House.
0.0	0.365420518751	You know why three?
0.0	0.365420518751	You know why three?
0.0	0.36550006843	And when we -- and when we do that, we don't do what the Republicans want, which is to cut Social Security.
0.0	0.365557164384	If there's an act of violence in America, his immediate answer before he even knows the facts is gun control.
0.0	0.365666232761	And we are going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fall.
0.0	0.365871063077	The result of that, you had the Iranian Revolution coming in, and that is where we are today.
0.0	0.365894539059	I know we can do this because we're still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.
0.0	0.365944515794	In other words, the very rich are getting richer, almost everybody is going -- getting poorer.
0.0	0.365955200287	Every election we talk about this.
0.0	0.365988776226	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.366171278074	But it doesn't change my view that we need to empower everyone, women and men, to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make.
0.0	0.366213369728	Then you have to get rid of Larry Kudlow, who sits on your panel, who's a great guy, who came out the other day and said, I love Trump's tax plan.
0.0	0.366535275551	It was the AFL-CIO.
0.0	0.366620507327	And by those standards, we're not doing particularly well.
0.0	0.367021953163	This stuff is fantasy.
0.0	0.36707051872	No, that's -- you're wrong.
0.0	0.367112614147	What we need to do is destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.367496024968	Let me say, I read that editorial today with a great amusement.
0.0	0.367514592253	And when you have insider information, which apparently has been the case, where people use that information and use big data to try to take advantage of it, there has to be some regulation.
0.0	0.367535391842	A Republican Congress did that.
1.0	0.367548633316	When I look at the migration, I looked at the line, I said it actually on your show recently, where are the women?
0.0	0.367805649021	In my family, my dad fled oppression in Cuba to come to America.
0.0	0.368103930429	Progressives don't believe that.
0.0	0.368368638854	Stimulating the economy -- because it's tethered down right now with so many regulations...
0.0	0.368436871456	So -- you know, you shouldn't misrepresent how well you're doing with the polls.
0.0	0.36846865029	Gronkowski is still going strong.
0.0	0.368610669537	Imagine -- imagine -- if a politician were held to that standard of account.
0.0	0.368612415344	I just don't believe that this country's days are going to be deeply -- you know, going down.
0.0	0.368660140537	Is there going to be any change in the House with new leadership?
0.0	0.368835120962	Both Donald and Jeb have good points, and there is a middle ground.
0.0	0.368893833815	Now, Donald...
0.0	0.369029449297	...numerically, it's gonna be higher.
0.0	0.369122407444	Yes, it's very simple.
0.0	0.369195400192	Well, with respect to Syria, I really do appreciate the efforts that Secretary Kerry has made.
0.0	0.369208400036	I would change them.
0.0	0.369233041711	I've had my issues with Donald Trump.
0.0	0.369602170815	He's been a good governor, and he's a heck of a lot better than his predecessor that would have bankrupted New Jersey.
0.0	0.369680336058	We're asking the top 1.5 percent, including passive income, to start paying a little bit more so that the elderly and disabled vets in this country can live with security and dignity.
0.0	0.36968482204	We need a nominee who is going to throw every punch, not pull punches, and someone who cannot stumble before he even gets into the ring.
0.0	0.369764409669	But here's the real key.
0.0	0.369828365128	I've got a very simple strategy as your president against ISIL.
0.0	0.369842731444	With a couple of additional tweaks, we know what this will do.
0.0	0.369896215436	And I'll note that California senator -- Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said, if she could say to Mr. America and Mrs. America, "give me your guns, I'm rounding them up," she would.
0.0	0.370075445265	I have proposed there be a Middle East NATO so that we can combine our allies there to stand up to Iranian expansion, and at the same time join together to begin to stop and this ISIL thing before it becomes an actual state.
0.0	0.370099779571	The other Arab countries have a role to play in this.
0.0	0.370154453622	-- fix America, this is the formula.
0.0	0.370316337377	So we have a good group of people.
0.0	0.370366345649	China, they don't like to tell us but they have total control -- just about, of North Korea.
0.0	0.370448174771	That's real moral authority that we need in the Oval Office.
0.0	0.37071597549	And the fact of the matter is if we give them a mission and we don't tie their hands behind their back, they can get it accomplished.
0.0	0.371019950726	I am all in favor of keeping these talented people here so they can go to work in Silicon Valley.
0.0	0.371028337456	Because I think we have to get to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.371067017932	I am proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend.
0.0	0.371091003015	That debate reflected a debate between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks.
0.0	0.371186687707	But if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in Flint.
0.0	0.371245332118	Well, this is going to be a show me, don't tell me election.
0.0	0.371363268552	I can agree with you or not, but you can't have a question over your head.
0.0	0.371662140338	We need to use our technological advantages, because what we've warned of is an international guerrilla movement that threatens this country.
0.0	0.371761789849	I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators -- back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.
0.0	0.371880127092	Here's the deal, Chris is totally right.
0.0	0.37196884502	No, the Federal Government should not play a larger role.
0.0	0.372070370523	I applaud Secretary Kerry and the president for trying to put together this agreement.
0.0	0.372086480828	The fact is -- and if for some reason he beats the rest of the field, he beats the rest of the field (inaudible).
0.0	0.372155645126	The talk has got to stop, the action has got to begin.
0.0	0.372379060217	And yet when he won, he turned to me, trusting my judgment, my experience, to become secretary of state.
0.0	0.372597651538	If I become President because we'll have a Constitutional Amendment to require a federally balanced budget so they will do their job.
0.0	0.3728063392	The agreement on humanitarian relief now needs to be implemented, because there are enclaves that are literally filled with starving people throughout Syria.
0.0	0.372966685289	Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well.
0.0	0.373025103256	I talked about Donald Trump from the standpoint of being an individual who was using his celebrity rather than his conservatism.
0.0	0.373248765627	I had to answer every single question about every single result and every single projection in public until there were no more questions.
0.0	0.373274296044	My state is doing great across the board.
0.0	0.373285999117	Our legal immigration system from now on has to be merit-based.
0.0	0.373384800072	That was not, as I understand it, the secretary's position.
0.0	0.373590666113	Let me just say this.
0.0	0.373594142964	In my view healthcare is a right of all people, not a privilege, and I will fight for that.
0.0	0.373789571703	The choice between a weak economy and a strong environment is a false choice, that is not the choice I'll offer America.
0.0	0.37385770852	And you combine that with a plan to make manufacturing -- this country number one in manufacturing, you've got someone who's going to help revitalize and give hope to America, the place -- the place is that is the most hopeless today.
0.0	0.37394701479	America is back in the leadership business.
0.0	0.373978672073	Every war you can imaging, we have people at each other's throat and our strength is actually in our unity.
0.0	0.374002429642	So the indignation that you carry on, some of the stuff, you have to also own then.
0.0	0.374139901277	See, in Ohio, we've had some controversial decisions.
0.0	0.374188500852	I've watched to see people say that we should dismantle Medicare and Medicaid and leave the senior citizens out -- out in the -- in the cold.
0.0	0.374330533554	It's why you see the pharmaceuticals getting together.
0.0	0.374349409755	This president, this president is more interested in funding -- less interested in funding the military, than he is in funding planned -- he's more interested in funding Planned Parenthood than he is in funding the military.
0.0	0.37449076478	And sadly, in America today, in our economy, a whole lot of those poor people are African-American.
0.0	0.374550055738	First of all, John got lucky with a thing called fracking, OK?
0.0	0.374558923785	You know, in our country, there are a lot of people who feel as though they just don't have the power.
0.0	0.37468503985	Over time, we're going to become energy independent.
0.0	0.3747430075	It's like them getting mugged, and then us saying, well, we're going to mug you some more.
0.0	0.374781933851	And that's why this study, which shows that if you can believe it today, for white working class people between 45 and 54, life expectancy is actually going down.
0.0	0.374974718913	So we do as the United States have to support our friends, our allies in Europe.
0.0	0.375025095468	You know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in America.
0.0	0.37526030716	But the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with Iran, maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world, yes, that is something I want to achieve.
0.0	0.375544477402	... the best results, wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
0.0	0.375596923003	I am convinced because I see how he works with his attorney general, not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0.0	0.376082471933	And if I could say just one thing.
0.0	0.376217086228	I ran for office to make the generational changes in Louisiana.
0.0	0.376292576769	I totally get that.
0.0	0.376536805828	You know, as I said already twice in this debate, we have a very serious problem in this country.
0.0	0.376690118549	That, I think, between the two of us demonstrates the strength of the support we have among people who want to see change in our country.
0.0	0.376697741787	We would still have LGBT people who get married on Saturday and get fired on Monday.
0.0	0.376989540901	I think it's a wonderful that that businesses start a 401(k).
0.0	0.377009560959	I love this country.
0.0	0.37706919396	It puts us on a level, even playing field, which brings jobs here at home...
0.0	0.377229872252	The fact is, there is a big overhang.
0.0	0.377255400916	Government causes a problem, and then government steps in to solve the problem.
0.0	0.377376399715	I find it very, very hard to forgive people that deceived me.
0.0	0.37739336867	That's why I'm running for office because when I become president of the United States, on my first day in office we are going to repeal every single one of his unconstitutional executive orders.
0.0	0.377589817886	I ask for your support to build, together, a safer and stronger America.
0.0	0.377591086978	s entrenched problems head-on.
0.0	0.377793282774	I don't think anybody should expand Medicaid.
0.0	0.377901888905	Nobody -- I could stand up here all night.
0.0	0.377955443646	Who can you count on to keep us safer, stronger and freer?
0.0	0.378007599496	The only way we're going to solve this problem is with we, the people.
0.0	0.378017344222	We should be relying upon the leadership of the Congress to pass the laws.
0.0	0.378033875677	You can -- if you -- you flew in with your 767, didn't you?
0.0	0.378305975139	It was a back sacrifice, and I have to hand it to Ben.
0.0	0.378371524291	No Jeb, I don't remember -- well, let me tell you.
0.0	0.378612202944	Government trying to level the playing field between Internet and brick-and-mortar creates a problem.
0.0	0.378615217642	I was not at all.
0.0	0.378803189734	We're friends.
0.0	0.378843497554	But let me just say that we also need down -- to tear down the cyber walls that China is erecting, that Russia is erecting.
0.0	0.378915845102	And you combine that with reforms of our welfare system.
0.0	0.379056315107	I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would.
0.0	0.379098946429	The truth is I had to make some tough calls in some tough times.
0.0	0.379240811247	And it's not too much to ask of our generation after everything our parents and our grandparents did for us.
0.0	0.379572336886	I believe in government, but I believe in efficient government, not wasteful government.
1.0	0.379597707457	Nobody knows who Mossadegh was, democratically-elected prime minister of Iran.
0.0	0.379689198872	Our job has to be to recognize the conflict between the two.
0.0	0.380389611668	There's a big question mark on your head.
0.0	0.38060138757	We're against your policies.
0.0	0.380645161034	We are in a war against ISIS.
0.0	0.380674995657	Now, you've got Europe.
0.0	0.380709107263	So, yes, I do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white Americans -- particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have -- you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is.
0.0	0.380718130448	We have been debating right here the core difference between conservatism and progressivism.
0.0	0.380840924295	You also have to prove that you're going to pay these people more than you would pay someone else, so that you're not undercutting it by bringing in cheap labor.
0.0	0.380858023025	Imagine a country where the middle class can get rising income again.
0.0	0.380870806137	In fact, frankly, he's complaining about the fact that we're losing some of the most talented people.
0.0	0.381142173758	It comes from the right, from the left, from people on all sides of the political spectrum.
0.0	0.381168261774	Neil, my name was mentioned here.
0.0	0.381413301096	Because, I've got to tell you the truth, even in New Jersey what you're doing is called rude.
0.0	0.381570248331	Since he has changed his mind on amnesty, on health care and on abortion, I would just ask, what are the principles by which he will govern?
0.0	0.381671367287	I choose him as my vice presidential candidate, and the Democrats sue because we can't take him along for the ride.
0.0	0.381681773102	And based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don't add up, and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now.
0.0	0.382094780525	If they don't treat us fairly, hey, their whole trade is tariffed.
0.0	0.382128714232	We have to go after terrorist networks, predominantly ISIS -- that's not the only one, but let's focus on that for a minute.
0.0	0.382130511771	Let me -- let me answer your question on the Sun-Sentinel editorial today.
0.0	0.382141803135	Let me just close it out this way.
0.0	0.38219812868	But if I become president, I couldn't care less about my company.
0.0	0.382202374151	If somebody's already stolen money from you, are you going to give them more?
0.0	0.382204495505	The people that Washington leaves behind.
0.0	0.382292533693	I don't know if people understand, but I spent a lifetime with my colleagues getting us to a federal balanced budget.
0.0	0.382657399674	President Obama and I are friends.
0.0	0.382770640227	I said right from the beginning that we should take no Syrian refugees of any kind.
0.0	0.382822984148	It turns out we knew something was wrong.
0.0	0.383032929013	Well, gee, after the last debate, I was told that I didn't smile enough.
0.0	0.383071012099	But we can give people better health care.
0.0	0.383180632087	I mean, let me be honest with the people who are watching at home.
0.0	0.383440409019	And what I have concluded is that the best policy is to get rid of all government subsidies, and get the government out of our lives, and let people rise and fall based on how good they are.
0.0	0.383726250728	We need to get back in the game as it relates to our Arab nations.
0.0	0.383817305945	It's not responsible.
0.0	0.383838551426	We don't need newer (ph) laws.
1.0	0.383874233879	And he says, the president's appointee, that crime is going up because of this.
0.0	0.384023897174	And specifically, we know that we could have detected and repelled some of these cyber attacks if that collaboration had been permitted.
0.0	0.384109179036	Or, are you going to deal with the problem by saying, I'm going to give people who've done well in this country less benefit on the backend.
0.0	0.384201391226	Well, look, I think that she's been saying that for as long as I've known her, which is about 25 years.
0.0	0.384254543089	The other issue is mental health.
0.0	0.384281074097	Well, if that's the case, we're going to win every state, if Bernie Sanders is the nominee.
1.0	0.384284265661	As I understand it, the African-American community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse.
0.0	0.384342777178	We now have some good models about how better to provide employment, housing and education.
0.0	0.384374562407	The fact is in New Jersey, what we have done is to make it easier now to get a conceal and carry permit.
0.0	0.384672837426	We will arm and train the Kurds.
1.0	0.384739952815	Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan.
0.0	0.385010564538	And that is what they told me when I was in Jordan in November.
0.0	0.385107553679	And that free education of extraordinary accomplishment was from first grade to 12th grade.
0.0	0.385225580251	I have a slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially.
0.0	0.385351902157	Republicans and Democrats alike believe this.
0.0	0.385387937939	The point I'm making is this, the Federal Government should not be in a lot of things.
0.0	0.385564012758	But, what we did is we said to the working families of this country, look, we know things are tough, but if you want to help us go beyond establishment politics, and establishment economics, send us something.
1.0	0.385755347324	We don't need the federal government to be involved in this at all.
0.0	0.385839849303	We have to lead a coalition that will take back territory from ISIS.
0.0	0.38595116536	And that is what's so critical for our neighborhoods, our families, our children, and our grandchildren.
0.0	0.385964053798	Well Maria, thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the New York Times.
0.0	0.386090590452	And we should back up the recent donors conference to make sure we have made our contribution to try to deal with the enormous cost that these refugees are posing to Turkey and to members of the E.U.
0.0	0.386167577437	That's not the way the game is supposed to be played.
0.0	0.386168180502	Look, every time the Federal Government gets engaged in something it gets worse.
0.0	0.386217439684	But this is nothing new.
1.0	0.386432810362	And Iranian wise guys having guns to their heads.
0.0	0.386481791429	That's why George Romney, Mitt's dad, was eligible to run for president, even though he was born in Mexico.
0.0	0.386514882844	America was worth the wait.
0.0	0.386523215601	You don't know it, they tax us.
0.0	0.38658110352	I didn't find it offensive at all.
0.0	0.386611478528	These mythical Arab armies that my friends talk about that are going to protect us don't exist.
0.0	0.386733398045	And I said, "Didn't you resent America for not letting you be with your father in those formative and very threatening years?"
0.0	0.386764241092	He's missing the whole point, that America's leadership in the world is required for peace and stability.
0.0	0.386777844422	We're not -- the American people -- forget about anything else, they've already been lied to and stolen from.
0.0	0.386890943728	I suspect you may have.
0.0	0.386942153441	We're going to take the political handcuffs off the military.
0.0	0.387181073684	We have to obey the laws.
0.0	0.38718362772	They shouldn't be going to Europe.
0.0	0.387338339299	We don't need to raise taxes to get this done.
0.0	0.387405516132	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.387405516132	I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.
0.0	0.387715926747	And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word.
0.0	0.387983185148	...This is a matter not of math, this is a matter of morality.
0.0	0.388054015326	As a result of his efforts and the efforts of Joe Biden against unprecedented, I was there in the Senate, unprecedented Republican obstructionism, we have made enormous progress.
0.0	0.38808122455	But the ideal scenario is to train Americans to do the work so we don't have to rely on people from abroad.
1.0	0.388205896947	But I want to -- I want to follow up on something having to do with leadership, because, you know, today Senator Sanders said that President Obama failed the presidential leadership test.
0.0	0.388237145628	Right there, right next to the plant.
0.0	0.388417254812	Work requirements and time limits.
0.0	0.388725884809	Look, the -- the deal is already done.
0.0	0.388930867137	That never works.
0.0	0.388967561816	It was a coalition made up of Arabs and Americans and westerners and we're going to need it again.
0.0	0.388972836553	No, they don't like he beats the rest of the field, because they want me.
0.0	0.389046340351	I mean, you have great constitutional lawyers that say you can't run.
0.0	0.389092114419	You've got to keep asking because this is a hugely important issue.
0.0	0.38918484322	Let me tell you that, in this country -- in this country, people are concerned about their economic future.
0.0	0.389186173133	You see, you have one side, the Democrats, and with immigration, all they care about is votes.
0.0	0.389242125002	And I'll tell you what, Donald, you -- you very kindly just a moment ago offered me the V.P.
0.0	0.3894793862	The domino theory, you know, if Vietnam goes, China, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.
0.0	0.389583674742	And we will join the rest of the other -- the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families.
0.0	0.389759996526	The time to turn the page is now.
0.0	0.389822445906	Why should we let their people be sitting there smoking their cigars, sitting in their comfortable chairs in Raqqa?
0.0	0.389877502641	Why not go to Congress and in a bipartisan way, begin to deal with the process of mental health issues so that people that are spiraling out of control because of mental health challenges don't have access to guns.
0.0	0.389952582264	Well, it ain't Henry Kissinger.
0.0	0.390159232982	Maria, you look at what this president and his secretary of state, Secretary of State Clinton, has done to get us in this spot.
0.0	0.390205680522	We honest to god are here to get this country back on track.
0.0	0.390604906392	Thirdly, we need to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to send a serious signal that we're back in the game with Israel --
0.0	0.390638296286	Let me tell you, Donald Trump would be a president every day of the week and twice on Sunday, rather than Hillary.
0.0	0.390785613624	This is a group of people that enslaves women and sells them, sells them as brides.
0.0	0.391089814356	I would a whole lot rather had Carly Fiorina over there doing our negotiation than John Kerry.
0.0	0.391134513926	Well, this is one of the reasons why Tom Perkins and I had disagreements in the boardroom, Becky.
0.0	0.391142516495	So I not only had the opportunity to go through the Cold War struggles in Central America, and even after 9/11 to be involved.
0.0	0.391166573945	I think our country is tired of the politicians who simply read the polls and fail to lead.
0.0	0.391295110822	I'm just saying.
0.0	0.39160889572	On welfare.
0.0	0.391634210827	I find -- I mean, it's just a very different, you know, historical perspective here.
0.0	0.391688411989	You know how many votes John McCain missed when he was carrying out that furious comeback that you're now modeling after?
0.0	0.391703552701	It was a hard choice.
0.0	0.391707578641	First of all, Ohio does have an energy industry, but we're diversified.
0.0	0.39188489159	I don't think you expand entitlements when so many people are dependent on government and when the money the federal government is offering is going to be taken away from you after just a couple of years.
0.0	0.392400948421	They are a sophisticated purveyor of propaganda, a celebrator of violence, an instigator of attacks using their online presence.
0.0	0.392479981457	Maria -- Maria, what you were talking about just now is called corporate inversion.
0.0	0.392495411085	And I just couldn't agree -- disagree more with those kinds of comments.
0.0	0.392823939413	So he had to leave the Situation Room after hearing from the small group advising him and he had to make that decision.
0.0	0.39300783648	I will stand firm.
0.0	0.393164848399	The people aren't dumb.
0.0	0.393228173014	This campaign is not just about electing a president.
0.0	0.393397461539	Let me give you one quick example.
0.0	0.393745949817	Now it is their time to help the middle class.
0.0	0.393956178317	How about Obamacare, a certified job killer?
0.0	0.394004032191	He was on the board.
0.0	0.394279030798	Nobody can deny them.
0.0	0.394653203518	It did not come from our Judeo-Christian roots, I can tell you that.
0.0	0.394808726649	If we were to expand Medicaid, for every uninsured person we would cover, we'd kick more than one person out of private insurance or remove their opportunity to get private insurance.
0.0	0.394809128487	I had to work my way through school.
0.0	0.394947094075	Folks, we've got to wake up.
0.0	0.395274898218	In my world, we'll focus on energy independence and a clean environment.
0.0	0.395346094775	It will create a manufacturing juggernaut in this country.
0.0	0.395421255818	Our next president, and our Republican nominee can not be someone who supports those positions.
0.0	0.395498000955	I hope the Supreme Court upholds them.
0.0	0.395523319173	I want security for this country.
0.0	0.395580642245	But I'm not worried about my finances, I'm worried about the finances of everyday Americans who today are struggling in an economy that is not producing good paying jobs while everything else costs more.
0.0	0.395967066531	We're going to get more revenue.
0.0	0.3959723295	I would say that I would and I have a permit, which is very unusual in New York -- a permit to carry.
0.0	0.395981288902	That's my view.
0.0	0.396113097576	Look, in addition to what Donald was saying is we also need to talk about the legal immigration system for permanent residents.
0.0	0.396237369369	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.396296275106	No, I think the idea was that president -- then-Senator Obama was wrong for suggesting that it is a good idea to talk to your opponents.
0.0	0.396415375693	And in fact I would go further.
0.0	0.39646740475	We don't have a health care crisis in America, we have a health crisis.
0.0	0.396535549757	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.396535549757	I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.
0.0	0.396644098069	We have people out of work.
0.0	0.396975505323	This isn't -- this isn't, you know, a different kind of job.
0.0	0.396977592864	I think it was a mistake to expand Medicaid everywhere in Ohio and across the country.
0.0	0.397100358294	So we have to go after this both abroad and at home.
0.0	0.397152915891	Listen, we -- this is the greatest country in the history of mankind.
0.0	0.397158568315	They recognize that people's actions don't always match their words.
0.0	0.397196837449	We used to win, we don't win anymore.
0.0	0.397241331698	Like rich kids, they deserve to get a free education.
0.0	0.397251482526	It always seems to be the private marketplace does a better job.
0.0	0.397353806035	And as someone who's worn the uniform of the country, that's how we build our military back up.
0.0	0.397509828069	And it troubles me that people are rewarded for tearing down our country.
0.0	0.397524153081	They do not get any credit for their care-taking responsibilities.
0.0	0.397706128585	Well, I'll tell you something: you can take everything from the top 1 percent, and you apply it to our fiscal gap, and you won't even make a dent in it.
0.0	0.397800422111	I'm the only person on this stage that actually was involved in the chief architect of balancing the Federal Budget.
0.0	0.39796634945	This is extraordinary.
0.0	0.398200910519	The simple fact is that the plane that's being build here is being sold to China.
0.0	0.398297614756	Probably, I don't know -- you people write the stuff.
0.0	0.398311055211	We had Hezbollah.
0.0	0.398381001033	We have arrived at a point in our nation's history where the potential of this nation and too many Americans is being crushed by the weight, the power, the cost, the complexity, the ineptitude, the corruption of the federal government, and only someone who will challenge the status quo of Washington, D.C. can lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.0	0.398386793219	We have to eliminate the sequester, rebuild our military in a way that makes it clear that we're back in the game.
0.0	0.398524236222	Every time he's got a chance, going all the way back to -- remember that Great Beer Summit he had after he messed up that time.
0.0	0.398718561608	That is the appropriate approach in order to get the results that you are seeking.
0.0	0.398871237509	I want to tackle those barriers that stand in the way of too many Americans right now.
0.0	0.398917261073	It seems to me that given our history as a nation that has been a beacon of hope for the oppressed, for the downtrodden, that I very strongly disagree with those Republican candidates who say, you know what, we've got to turn our backs on women and children who left their home with nothing, nothing at all.
0.0	0.398987955738	We have got to demilitarize local police departments so they do not look like occupying armies.
0.0	0.399569839188	And he was a managing general partner.
0.0	0.39957469548	If you look at the numbers, there are actually as many, if not more white communities that are truly being left behind and left out.
0.0	0.399591321392	If we means test Social Security, it means that the government decides whether or not I deserve it.
0.0	0.399812137874	This is why, fundamentally, we have to take our government back.
0.0	0.399812595971	We've got to stop this culture of government dependence.
0.0	0.400085696956	All I'm saying is our next president has to be someone that undoes the damage Barack Obama has done to this country.
0.0	0.400088925671	I would change them.
0.0	0.400208102129	Here is the one thing I'm not going to do.
1.0	0.400224324636	And on Common Core, Common Core has been eliminated in New Jersey.
0.0	0.400298644148	Now, let me just be clear, John.
0.0	0.400407536073	2016 is going to be a fight between conservatism, and a Democrat party that is undermining the very character of this nation.
0.0	0.400529158717	Someone's going to be collecting this tax.
0.0	0.40067591456	I know what it's like to owe that money, and we've worked hard.
0.0	0.400708951502	There is a war against ISIS, not just against ISIS but against radical jihadists terrorists, and it is a war that they win or we win.
0.0	0.400760974566	We need somebody who can balance budgets, cut taxes...
0.0	0.400765757272	Do senators have the right to disagree with the president?
0.0	0.400770928706	For too long -- no, for too long, what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our people's jobs, and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us.
0.0	0.400837331114	And as Reagan demonstrated, if we cut taxes, we can bring back growth.
0.0	0.400935720393	They explode the bomb, we have an electromagnetic pulse.
0.0	0.400960993305	It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are.
0.0	0.400979659116	Where are you gonna clean it up?
0.0	0.401045997648	don't listen to the Trumps of the world and allowing them to divide us.
0.0	0.401166529568	I mean, she would drive a car until it wouldn't make a sound, and then gather up all her coins and buy a new car.
0.0	0.401177836256	And, it was made for we the people, we are the ones who decide who we are, and we should never give away the values and principles that made America into a great nation for the sake of political correctness.
0.0	0.401217368803	I would just say this, we've heard a lot of great ideas up here, and I agree with what Senator Rubio said.
0.0	0.401266728087	A law has been sitting -- languishing, sadly, on Capitol Hill and has not yet been passed, and it would help.
0.0	0.401302781414	We differ, however, on a couple of key points.
0.0	0.401332168748	You're not going to even allow them to come to our country?
0.0	0.401397405913	Because this president has consistently underestimated the threat of ISIS.
0.0	0.401652333659	And -- and -- you know, the concept of New York values is not that complicated to figure out.
0.0	0.401658309815	They don't like NBC, but I like the poll.
0.0	0.402083373605	We can use it to break up the banks, if that's appropriate.
0.0	0.402164099417	It takes away discretion from judges.
0.0	0.402168708128	I used the laws of the country to my benefit, I'm sorry.
0.0	0.402622561737	Well, first of all the -- the plan gives people the option of -- of opting out.
0.0	0.402863826053	It's "give me options on how I can make it harder for law-abiding people to buy guns."
0.0	0.40302341144	Our best days are in front of us.
0.0	0.403201503485	I've laid out...
0.0	0.403226616241	But honestly, if you're a small business owner today you are being crushed.
0.0	0.403380632663	So as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and the like.
0.0	0.403454035863	None of these instances that the president points to as the reason why he's doing these things would have been preventive.
0.0	0.404124659764	I think the last eight years in the private sector have allowed me to see government from the outside, and I think that is a positive thing.
0.0	0.404135418769	I'm against the kind of inhumane treatment that is now being visited upon families, waking them up in the middle of the night, rounding them up.
0.0	0.404491070579	We don't need Hillary Clinton's price controls for -- again, does anybody out there think that giving Washington, D.C., the opportunity to run the pharmaceutical industry is a good idea, given how well they have done running the government?
0.0	0.404744336212	And it's not the folks on Wall Street.
0.0	0.405016662663	And I ask everyone in America to call Congress tomorrow and say enough is enough; no more debt.
0.0	0.405039138596	We're going to end up in the same place.
0.0	0.405256451783	I happen to believe that Putin is doing what he is doing because his economy is increasingly in shambles and he's trying to rally his people in support of him.
0.0	0.405626114608	Well, first off, what we don't do is do what Hillary Clinton and John Kerry and Barack Obama want us to do, which is their solution for everything, put more taxes on it, give more money to Washington, D.C., and then they will fix it.
0.0	0.405745022029	They're looking -- they're recruiting people that enter this country as doctors and engineers and even fiances.
0.0	0.405987461048	I was recruited to H.P.
0.0	0.406015340666	They're making a half, two-thirds what they used to make.
0.0	0.406205586066	...you wrote a story on it, and you had to go back and correct it.
0.0	0.406239366432	And clearly, what we need to do is get a group of experts together, including people from other countries, some of our friends from Israel, who have had experience screening these people and come up with new guidelines for immigration, and for visas, for people who are coming into this country.
0.0	0.406576948888	All over this country we have Republican candidates for president saying we hate the government.
0.0	0.406756427516	It just needs a corporate executive type at the top that's done it before.
0.0	0.406763636665	But like all of our problems, there isn't a single one that can't be solved with common sense if you remove the ego and the politics.
0.0	0.40695806573	The questions that are being asked shouldn't be trying to get people to tear into each other.
0.0	0.407040869701	I would say the message that got us the win in Iowa and 10 other states against pretty overwhelming odds, is the message that's going to deliver us in this election.
0.0	0.407280289881	I laid out a plan at the Citadel to do just that and it starts with creating a "No Fly Zone" and "Safe Zones" to make sure refugees are there.
0.0	0.407325428845	We have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9/11, and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks, yet we see the terrible attack in San Bernardino and know that we haven't done enough.
0.0	0.407350853358	I am the only person in either campaign that's self-funding.
0.0	0.40741548695	Suicide, alcoholism, drugs, that's why we need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country, and not just a handful of billionaires who have enormous economic and political power.
0.0	0.4076458112	I believe that we need to cut these taxes down, we need to be on a roadmap to balancing the budget, and we need to send power, money, and influence, the welfare department, the education department, job training, infrastructure, Medicaid, all of that out of Washington back to the states so we can run these programs from where we live to the top, not a one size fits all mentality that they have in Washington.
0.0	0.408394549322	So listen, this is the difference between being a governor and a senator.
0.0	0.40850853105	And first of all, we've got to recognize that there is problem that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have caused.
0.0	0.408632007693	The only way we're going to defund Planned Parenthood is have a pro-life president.
0.0	0.408800379746	You know, I know to a lot of people in the media, this is just a great big game, and we're the players.
0.0	0.408875665801	I would give up some Social Security to save a system that Americans are going to depend on now and in the future.
0.0	0.409629912352	This mandatory sentencing, a very bad idea.
0.0	0.409938917419	And if I am president and we get our hands on him, he is standing trial for treason.
0.0	0.410087964966	So you know, I had to report results every 90 days in excruciating detail.
0.0	0.410140545405	Any connection to the fact that not one Republican candidate for president thinks and agrees with the scientific community that climate change is real and that we have got to transform our energy system?
0.0	0.410363085021	And by the way, it's not just on immigration, you used to support TPA, now you say you're against it.
0.0	0.410686812557	When we do business with China, they tax us.
0.0	0.41079667144	I was ready to lead, but I wasn't ready to run.
0.0	0.410850981723	And I say, look, it's not Republicans' fault, it's not Democrats' fault, it's your grandparents' fault for having too many damn kids.
0.0	0.410911984268	We had a decision to make early on, do we do a Super PAC?
0.0	0.410943700292	We have a huge mental health problem in this country.
0.0	0.411683513457	It's actually evidence of the bias that exists in the American media today.
0.0	0.411837921546	And remember, the Russians have not gone after ISIS or any of the other terrorist groups.
0.0	0.411890129012	They say, " well, we don't really have control."
0.0	0.411932809774	It's why you see the banks consolidating.
0.0	0.412461799876	I -- I've been for pausing on admitting the Syrian refugees.
0.0	0.412581138675	And I mean, are you kidding me?
0.0	0.412869855454	I think we have achieved a great deal with the Iranian nuclear agreement to put a lid on the Iranian nuclear weapons program.
0.0	0.412938436138	I am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of Vermont from very significant majorities of women.
0.0	0.413015095579	The big corporations have the scale to deal with all of this.
0.0	0.4132259159	No radical Islam that is allowed to engage in encouraging violence against Americans, that is not protected speech.
0.0	0.413238624078	They understand the vulnerabilities we have on the southern border.
0.0	0.413279114161	At that particular point in time, then Americans will believe that Washington is up to a conversation to deal with the millions of people that are here illegally, but not until.
0.0	0.413351941695	You know, the Russians wanted to buy time.
0.0	0.413746537879	Just ditto to that.
0.0	0.413896592763	Last I heard we lived in a democratic society.
0.0	0.414209853824	Now we're having smaller families.
0.0	0.414719912019	Because what she will do is come in and she will raise Social Security taxes.
0.0	0.414872942297	They don't like somebody else like David Petraeus, they prosecute them and send a decorated general on to disgrace.
0.0	0.414936757741	You know, in recent travels around this country, I've encountered so many Americans who are discouraged and angry as they watch our freedom, our security and the American dream slipping away under an unresponsive government that is populated by bureaucrats and special interest groups.
0.0	0.41506102125	They hit us with a cyberattack simultaneously and dirty bombs.
0.0	0.415135555654	You spend the money today and then you hope you're going to save money tomorrow.
0.0	0.415157722267	Why don't we just give a chicken in every pot, while we're, you know, coming up -- coming up with these fantasy tax schemes.
0.0	0.415399475311	In fact, what that hurts is hurt hardworking taxpayers.
0.0	0.415426469248	Please do not tell me that in this country, if -- and here's the if -- we have the courage to take on the drug companies, and have the courage to take on the insurance companies, and the medical equipment suppliers, if we do that, yes, we can guarantee health care to all people in a much more cost effective way.
0.0	0.415521303467	And if we can do that in Texas, that 12th largest economy in the world, we can do it in America.
0.0	0.415745707103	Here at home, we've got to do a better job coordinating between federal, state, and local law enforcement.
0.0	0.416020810284	And, here's the difference between me and Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.416040094549	In her world, cap- and-trade would dominate, that we will destroy the economy in the name of helping the environment.

0.0	0.416645272078	Here's why, the president of the United States and both his attorney's general, they give the benefit of the doubt to the criminal, not to the police officers.
0.0	0.416647634788	You did support a U.N. Security Council approach, which we did follow up on.
0.0	0.416651085839	When I was 21, my mom died.
1.0	0.417033201019	You know, the FBI director, the president's appointed FBI director has said this week that because of a lack of support from politicians like the president of the United States, that police officers are afraid to get out of their cars; that they're afraid to enforce the law.
0.0	0.417286067019	We need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources, but from sources overseas, that can be a real-time fusion effort to get information where it's needed.
0.0	0.417305040568	In the crowd today is Major General James Livingston, who's the co-chairman of my campaign here in South Carolina, a Medal of Honor recipient.
0.0	0.417498991044	That sounds like people are afraid the president's going to take their guns away.
0.0	0.417872024882	And, if this government doesn't pay it, than tell me what's different between the government and Bernie Madolf, who sits in prison today for doing less than what the government has done to the people on social security and Medicare in this country.
0.0	0.418008002877	That's what I've always stood for.
0.0	0.418034713	The government is not supposed to be in every part of our lives, and that is what is causing the problem.
0.0	0.418260936134	You know, I think most people know exactly what New York values are.
0.0	0.418466860253	Maria, I'd like to interrupt this debate on the floor of the Senate to actually answer the question you asked, which was on entitlements.
0.0	0.418529170175	And you shouldn't have mentioned the polls because I would have been much...
0.0	0.418706523019	And, where we are failing abysmally is in the very high rate of recidivism we see.
0.0	0.418976496467	And that is that one of the things you're watching tonight are 11 quality candidates debating an important issue.
0.0	0.419281400547	And I was going to tell you, whether I'm president or not, we better make it clear to the Saudis that we're going to support you, we're in relation with you just like we were in the first Gulf War, but you've got to knock off the funding and teaching of radical clerics who are the very people who try to destroy us and will turn around and destroy them.

0.0	0.420105574279	A terrible sight.
0.0	0.420398771431	We've got a president who cannot bring himself to say the words "radical Islamic terrorism."

0.0	0.420963058277	I was invoked in that question, so let me just say -- in that answer -- let me say, the real question here, I hate to interrupt this episode of Court TV.
0.0	0.421066648797	Let me conclude by just saying this.
0.0	0.421071880375	They discussed how -- how hard it is to sell tractors in China, because all the regulatory barriers.
0.0	0.421333880647	Now, the challenge we're seeing today is that the Supreme Court is being converted into some type of political body.
0.0	0.42158571006	A healthy environment, a strong economy and energy independent America -- that would be the purpose of my presidency, is break the strangle hold that people enjoy on fossil fuels who hate our guts.
0.0	0.421627641552	This is about more than replacing a D with an R. We need a leader who will help us take our government back.
0.0	0.421667985155	Say again?
0.0	0.422116840927	Many businessmen want to endorse me.
0.0	0.422155342963	And I've done it in the state of Ohio as the chief executive.
0.0	0.422195547076	... that, having been in the trenches fighting for this, I believe strongly we have to guarantee health care.
0.0	0.422461168974	Marco voted on the other side.
0.0	0.422918315601	I'm not running against Governor Bush, I'm not running against anyone on this stage.
0.0	0.423018116942	And, you know, there are a number of programs that I think are duplicative and redundant and not producing the results that people deserve.
0.0	0.423126019916	It's a political Justice Department.
0.0	0.423326142556	Check it out.
0.0	0.423326142556	Check it out.
0.0	0.423365250481	He was overthrown by British and American interests because he threatened oil interests of the British.
0.0	0.423524884342	They're taking money from Social Security and they're going to spend it on the military and they're going to spend it on domestic spending.
0.0	0.423557368969	That's wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country.
0.0	0.423617809768	We actually did it.
0.0	0.423788160952	Do I take the product?
0.0	0.42416667448	And this deal is giving him a pathway to a bomb, a missile to deliver it, and money to pay for it all.
0.0	0.424330786121	And I would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country.
0.0	0.42440952302	If I am president of the United States, we're going to send soldiers back to Iraq, back to Syria, to keep us from being attacked here and keep soldiers in Afghanistan because we must.

0.0	0.42468103414	You didn't see these kind of ideas being batted around, and being batted around in a way that's civil and smart and that's trying to help to inform the voter out there.
0.0	0.424995445145	I believe that we have got to move toward a path toward citizenship.
0.0	0.425085524435	He has gone to China.

0.0	0.425667668748	And so do I.
0.0	0.42585378255	There is no other description of it.
0.0	0.42595359565	We should use the debt ceiling, as precisely to Don, to force upon them budgetary reforms.
0.0	0.426047439914	No, not a comic book, and it's not a very nicely asked question the way you say that.
0.0	0.426177229227	Can I just add one very quick thing?
0.0	0.426293726658	Maybe we would've gotten a deal where we didn't give everything away.
0.0	0.426299526727	Here's the truth.
0.0	0.426332528276	We have to get the remaining 10.
0.0	0.426346122061	I may not be your dream candidate just yet, but I can assure you I am Hillary Clinton's worst nightmare.
0.0	0.426364088744	That's all I'm saying.
0.0	0.426370902521	The age will have to gradually rise, there is no question.
0.0	0.426544111699	Whether it's welfare reform and getting something back for the hard-earned taxpayers; whether it's engaging in Pentagon reform and taking on the big contractors that were charging thousands of dollars for hammers and screw drivers and ripping us off; or whether it's taking on the special interests in the nursing home industry in Ohio, so that mom and dad can have the ability to stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.
0.0	0.426557405837	That is very different than talking about specific action for regime change, which I did not support.
0.0	0.426717662463	Now, I find it rather amazing, because I happen to believe that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country.
1.0	0.426730135429	Everybody voted for it wanting to see Libya move toward democracy, of course we all wanted to do that.
0.0	0.426850692615	Look, I am deeply concerned about what's happening in every community in America, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths.
0.0	0.427043067496	We need to reform Social Security.
0.0	0.427053808352	You gotta be -- stick with it, and all that.
0.0	0.427055951451	What's crony capitalism?
0.0	0.427061721177	The Republican Party is blessed to have 11 good candidates, (inaudible) 10 good candidates.
0.0	0.427103996791	It's the New York Times, they are always wrong.
0.0	0.427125819627	Look, here's the deal, in this particular case, the FBI made a mistake.
0.0	0.427253556198	It's like a 400 pound man saying, "I'm going to go on a diet, but I'm eating a sack of Krispy Kremes before I do."
0.0	0.427288136508	Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.
0.0	0.427568259455	I think he would have said bring back a 21st-century Glass-Steagall legislation.
0.0	0.427764144286	So I believe that working with Europe -- and, by the way, you know, we've got some very wealthy countries there in that part of the world.
0.0	0.427779706925	Washington gets bigger, taxes get higher, and the American people feel more distance from our government.
0.0	0.427803437251	That's how you go from secretary to CEO.
0.0	0.427959736041	You know, of the few questions I've got, the last one I need is to give him some more time.
0.0	0.428029116134	So you know the New York Times and I don't have exactly have the warmest of relationships.
0.0	0.428059400782	And in your heart of hearts, you cannot wait to see a debate between Hillary Clinton and Carly Fiorina.
0.0	0.428148700517	And that's why I've offered a specific program to the people of America tonight to address the fundamental problem of getting our country growing again, getting our economy growing, wages up, opportunities for people.
0.0	0.428309347125	But here's the best solution of all.
0.0	0.428388676948	And this is what we have to -- I -- I've got to tell you, when wages don't rise -- and they haven't for a lot of families for a number of years -- it's very, very difficult for them.
0.0	0.428758601192	And then what he did is redefine the role of government.
0.0	0.428967457723	So I'm asking women, I'm asking men, to support me because I'm ready to go into the White House on January 20th, 2017 and get to work on both domestic and foreign policy challenges.
0.0	0.429152673251	If she gets elected, her first 100 days, instead of setting an agenda, she might be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse.
0.0	0.429390738151	They're very, very badly wounded.
0.0	0.429516771994	We have to shut down, whether or not they're in prisons preaching or on -- in mosques preaching.
0.0	0.429564372105	When he meets with the attorney general in the White House, it's not "how can we protect the Second Amendment rights of Americans."
0.0	0.429599628004	And secondly, we should pass the legislation that I've introduced...
0.0	0.429764739467	But to destroy ISIS, it is necessary.
1.0	0.429913880335	And this is not the first time that he has criticized President Obama.
0.0	0.430023076735	I want to go back to what we were talking about earlier, this budget deal in Washington.
0.0	0.430060484142	Do we still have standards?
0.0	0.430179285675	I am convinced that this president, if he could get rid of the Second Amendment, he would.
0.0	0.430384315105	And Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will say it's those evil rich people.
0.0	0.430442481383	You know, I have two sons.
0.0	0.430963188025	The deployments are too high for the military personnel.
0.0	0.43133207319	But I would add this.
0.0	0.431366891688	It's like a tariff, but here's the difference: if we impose a tariff, China responds.
0.0	0.431389299275	I was down there, and I've never seen anything like it.
0.0	0.431457250751	One principle, for example, we've got to embrace is on immigration.
0.0	0.431526440117	People aren't dumb.
0.0	0.43175648824	You don't have seven children and bring them into this world if you're not optimistic about the future of this country.
0.0	0.432150157747	And it is now being put into place everyplace across the state of Ohio.
0.0	0.432388492213	We have to put the personnel on that border in the right places; you have to put the strategic fencing in place; and you have to have aviation assets that fly all the way from Tijuana to El Paso to Brownsville, Texas -- 1,933 miles looking down 24/7, with the technology to be able to identify what individuals are doing, and ID when they are in obviously illegal activities or suspicious activities, and quick response teams come.
0.0	0.432533942617	So you don't get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.
0.0	0.432553487479	Which is what we're gonna get if we elect a big government liberal like Hillary Clinton to the White House.
1.0	0.432612337027	It isn't there anymore, Mike.
0.0	0.432677332312	You know, she only had a third-grade education, but -- you know, she knew how to stretch a dollar.
0.0	0.433019851803	13 Hours -- tomorrow morning, a new movie will debut about the incredible bravery of the men fighting for their lives in Benghazi and the politicians that abandoned them.
0.0	0.433061823185	It is a unique nation in all of human history and on the face of the planet, because here, our founders believed that everyone has a right to fulfill their potential and that that right --they called it life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness -- comes from God and cannot be taken away by government.
0.0	0.433063440851	Community banks are going out of business.
0.0	0.433083847532	This president has failed, and when I'm in the Oval Office, police officers will know that they will have the support of the president of the Untied States.
0.0	0.43322258415	We have ISIS and al Qaeda attacking us.
0.0	0.433655553164	We need to create jobs.
0.0	0.43366216151	And we would still have governors like Scott Walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions.
0.0	0.433706311226	You really can't.
0.0	0.433769550844	We should be deporting criminals, not hardworking immigrant families who do the very best they can and often are keeping economies going in many places in our country.
0.0	0.433811578813	Our healthcare is a horror show.
0.0	0.433876658946	Can you have Medicare or Social Security?
0.0	0.433938475071	You know, you had Herbert Hoover before that saying, no, we got to only worry about the deficit.
0.0	0.434192322077	There are other attorneys that feel, and very, very fine constitutional attorneys, that feel that because he was not born on the land, he cannot run for office.
0.0	0.434712505969	In my view, it doesn't go anywhere near far enough.
0.0	0.434831820032	At the end of the day, the legal issue is quite straightforward, but I would note that the birther theories that Donald has been relying on -- some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on U.S. soil, but have two parents born on U.S. soil.
0.0	0.43495024785	Come with me to Iraq and Afghanistan, folks.
0.0	0.435015199137	That's exactly what we saw.
0.0	0.435058467963	A politician other than the people in the states -- I don't want to -- a politician cannot get them to pay.
0.0	0.435267967099	But many, many people did.
0.0	0.435310287215	The majority of people in American actually have values and principles and they believe in the very things that made America great.
0.0	0.435389941694	I'm running for president because there is no way we can elect Hillary Clinton to continue the policies of Barack Obama.
0.0	0.43548799947	We don't have to have refugees come to our country, but all Muslims, seriously?
0.0	0.435737476925	When I was 22, my dad died.
0.0	0.435739991186	In fact, he's done worse than nothing.
0.0	0.435809540842	Donald Trump actually seized on it when he talked about immigration.
0.0	0.435835508215	Why didn't they call?
0.0	0.436072133274	This country is running out of time.
0.0	0.436291536567	It's poor people and middle class.
0.0	0.436614974872	This is incredibly complicated, because we've got Iran as a big player, in addition to Russia.
0.0	0.436798291074	Well, I would begin by reminding people that at this point in previous presidential elections, Jimmy Carter couldn't win, Ronald Reagan couldn't win, Bill Clinton couldn't win, and neither could've Barack Obama.
0.0	0.437221798343	In fact, that's part of the problem.
0.0	0.43753786048	Until we have a president of the United States that gets up every day and goes to the Oval Office with the intent purpose of securing that border, and there's not anybody on either one of these stages that has the experience of dealing with this as I have for over 14 years with that 1200-mile border.
0.0	0.437570562503	We're not going to dismantle everything.
0.0	0.437848074155	If elected president, I will do everything I can to expand Social Security benefits, not just for seniors, but for disabled veterans, as well.
0.0	0.438014883846	Are you coming onboard a proposal?
0.0	0.438057154779	The American people have rejected your agenda and now you're trying to go around it.
1.0	0.438181829308	Under longstanding U.S. law, the child of a U.S. citizen born abroad is a natural-born citizen.
0.0	0.438213145131	The terrible, authoritarian, Communist dictatorship he warned us about, now he's urging companies to shut down and move to China.
0.0	0.438234805387	Detailed plans count, and I believe that the plan I've laid out to destroy ISIS before the tragedies of San Bernardino and Paris are the right ones.
0.0	0.438730035095	And that is wrong.
0.0	0.439027816608	I don't think it's so much about when the government orders a corporation to do something.
0.0	0.439080466172	We have to stand with them.
0.0	0.439215145858	And we can no longer continue to sweep it under the rug.
0.0	0.439593709399	I'm asking folks not just to join my campaign, but join a cause.
0.0	0.439641909517	And if you're going to leave this to Hillary Clinton, the person who gave us this foreign policy, the architect of it, and you're going to give her another four years, that's why I'm speaking out as strongly as I am about that.
0.0	0.439643143897	Who actually has stood up not just to Democrats, but to leaders in our own party?
0.0	0.43970510592	We can put America back on track on a growth level and a growth rate that we've never seen in the history of this country.
0.0	0.439847913474	And I'll go back to something that had been mentioned just a few minutes ago.
0.0	0.439909953786	And I'll allow putting that tariff or whatever he's saying here...
0.0	0.439938863094	We can't just allow it to continue on its current path the way that Hillary Clinton wants to do because there'll be major reductions in benefits in the next decade if we do nothing.
0.0	0.440040364734	And by the way, Jeb you mentioned Boeing, take a look.
0.0	0.440196601873	You have regulations -- I mean, come on, they're affecting everybody here, particularly our small businesses.
0.0	0.440224294281	But I have no argument with anyone making up her mind about who to support.
0.0	0.440252939425	In all due respect, Secretary Clinton, a lot of the progressive groups, the online groups have really asked you a simple question.
0.0	0.440478165162	Last I heard, a United States senator had the right to disagree with the president, including a president who has done such an extraordinary job.
0.0	0.440564936146	John Harwood, there's a bigger issue here.
0.0	0.440704929519	Those are the hard numbers.
0.0	0.440803401221	And nobody, nobody on either one of these stages has done more than I've done and the people of the State of Texas to deal with securing that border.
0.0	0.440889968654	If that's not hypocrisy, I don't know what hypocrisy is.
0.0	0.4412829926	I think there's a sense in this country today that somehow our best days are behind us.
0.0	0.441437397726	There are a lot of training programs and education programs that I think can be streamlined and put into a much better format so that if we do continue them they can be more useful, in public schools, community colleges, and colleges and universities.
0.0	0.441452897412	And I would note the other individuals on this stage were nowhere to be found in that fight.
0.0	0.441465887488	My parents in this country were able to give me the chance to do all the things they never did.
0.0	0.441490637703	Well, listen, I've spent my entire life defending the Constitution before the U.S. Supreme Court.
0.0	0.441597646837	This is absolutely disgusting, and revolts the conscience of the nation.
0.0	0.441602532875	So what I will tell you about our incentives -- our incentives are tight, and at the end of the day we make sure that we gain more from the creation of jobs than what we lose.
0.0	0.442001057003	Because they're recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees.
0.0	0.442076887806	We're a country of laws, not of men, not of people who do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.442313291005	Because we work with the private sector to make solar energy affordable and available to businesses and individuals in our state.
0.0	0.442354781475	People are upset about it.
0.0	0.442721863802	We do not have to have massive levels of income and wealth inequality.
0.0	0.443035633261	And also, I've been tested in a way no one else has.
0.0	0.443050633485	So this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement.
0.0	0.443274877496	It's a problem all over the world.
0.0	0.443358031874	You know, Obama has presented the American people with a false choice every time.
0.0	0.443657288837	The rest of the world is moving away from us towards other alliances because we are weak.
0.0	0.443966803035	And I think when you give low-income kids -- African-American, white, Latino kids -- the opportunities to get their lives together, they are not going to end up in jail.
1.0	0.444301523031	We have 400,000 small businesses forming every year in this country.
0.0	0.444611147772	This is not some small scale group.
0.0	0.44472880792	And somebody walked in and shot them, killed them.
0.0	0.44481731235	And they got a killer in San Bernardino in posing as a fiance.
0.0	0.444851011417	But in the interim, in the absence of that, what's happening is some of these tech companies are taking those -- those centers (ph) to Canada because they can get people to go over there instead of here.
0.0	0.444897846744	But you haven't asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought I'd get that off my chest if you don't mind.
0.0	0.444904821917	Today, I'm 60, I'm not married, I don't have any kids.
0.0	0.445040247183	But our goal is, in fact, to try over a period of time to, in fact, deal with our enemies, not just ignore that reality.
0.0	0.445069668123	Guaranteeing that women's work finally gets the pay, the equal pay that we deserve.
0.0	0.445192165051	Those three things put together are going to give confidence to job creators and you will begin to see wages rise.
0.0	0.445193012812	I mean, literally, the Senate -- what is it, like a French work week?
0.0	0.445255772321	That is the way to deal with China at the end of the day.
0.0	0.445601724958	It begins with tax reform.
0.0	0.445712886919	Now, the fact is, what this president has done is invited Russia to play an even bigger role, bring in Vladimir Putin to negotiate getting those chemical weapons back from Assad, yet what do we have today?
0.0	0.445719929723	I didn't inherit any money.
0.0	0.445744685309	You see, all of my career, I've fought about giving voice to the people that I grew up with and voice to the people that elected me.
0.0	0.445789161836	I far prefer that and the chances we have to be successful there than trying to start all over again, gridlocking our system, and trying to get from zero to 100 percent.
0.0	0.445862854867	And as a result of that, the shah of Iran came in, terrible dictator.
0.0	0.4459581546	He undermines it.
0.0	0.446001452252	Now, on that tariff -- here's what I'm saying, China -- they send their goods and we don't tax it -- they do whatever they want to do.
0.0	0.446020803092	And, sending mixed signals to kids about drugs is a disaster.
0.0	0.446462250657	And you put me on that stage against her next September, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.446468633723	What this campaign is about is creating a process for a political revolution in which millions of Americans, working people who have given up on the political process, they don't think anybody hears their pains or their concerns.
0.0	0.446606091298	I'm not talking about now, I'm talking about in the future they're building massive plants in China because China does not want Boeing building their planes here, they want them built in China, because China happens to be smart the way they do it, not the way we do it.
0.0	0.44673532233	This is the same old stuff since I left.
0.0	0.446780994119	So it's not just the government -- the private sector companies, it's also our own government that needs to raise the level of our game.
0.0	0.447041663275	And let me say this also.
0.0	0.447473051405	And I can do it regardless of what the makeup of Congress is because I did it in New York state.
0.0	0.447517833708	Let the states do this.
0.0	0.44773015769	I used the tithing analogy.
0.0	0.4478089818	But a great nation like ours should not be in a position where elderly people are cutting their pills in half, where they don't have decent nutrition, where they can't heat their homes in the wintertime.
0.0	0.447825199797	Here, we actually need 1,000 because we have natural barriers.
0.0	0.447877882006	I can only say that we both share the goal of universal health care coverage.
0.0	0.44788463803	But I will tell you this, Atlantic City, you're using that, hundreds of companies that I have opened have thrived.
0.0	0.44807092161	Why aren't we talking about -- instead of cutting benefits for old people, cutting benefits for sick people -- why don't we say, "let's cure the four big cost-driving diseases...
0.0	0.448078861514	ISIS came in, and now occupies significant territory in Libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold.
0.0	0.448195960021	If this country that does not keep its promise to seniors then what promise can this country hope to be trusted to keep?
0.0	0.44825160987	So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.448252515203	I think America is just a few good decisions and a leadership change at the top away from the best years we've ever had.
0.0	0.448323879737	I congratulate Secretary of State John Kerry and the president for working on this agreement.
0.0	0.448371198087	...eliminates the business...
0.0	0.448425182166	No one is a socialist.
0.0	0.448525700766	Neil, my name was mentioned as well.
0.0	0.448541637847	Let me just add one thing about ISIS over there.
0.0	0.448582091292	We have a country of laws.
0.0	0.448585528931	Jeb Bush says we've got to be willing to lose the primary in order to win the general.
0.0	0.448662801162	Or would you rather take less later on?
0.0	0.448887856513	That's not even an issue.
0.0	0.448951413965	A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to go on a congressional delegation.
0.0	0.448983507898	I think what our campaign is indicating is that the American people are tired of establishment politics, tired of establishment economics.
0.0	0.44899339022	What we should do is to be investing in all types of energy, John, all types of energy.
0.0	0.449041090455	When I am president of the United States, I'm going to side with Ronald Regan on this and not Nancy Pelosi and we are not having a vat tax.
0.0	0.449094138937	I just want to remind you, people paid their money.
0.0	0.449321309359	We didn't spend any.
0.0	0.449339937031	I'm not anti-Wall Street, but I don't believe the government ought to wear a team jersey, pick winners and losers.
0.0	0.449425262689	I would not place one American life at risk unless it was absolutely necessary.
0.0	0.4496682563	And, look, I think it's important to look at what the most important counterterrorism judgment of the first four years of the Obama administration was, and that was the very difficult decision as to whether or not to advise the president to go after bin Laden.
0.0	0.44972900368	The Europeans have moved on.
0.0	0.450052578633	I'm going to be introducing a plan which I call the 2020 Perfect Vision for America.
0.0	0.4502236098	You have to reform Social Security, and the simple way to do it is to make sure that the wealthiest don't receive the same benefits as people that are lower-income.
0.0	0.450393439386	But I agree with Jeb, you can't just do this by growing the economy.
0.0	0.450568039926	MACCALLUM: Thank you, Governor.
0.0	0.450720054017	Whose fault is it that Medicare is broken, out of money, that Social Security is broken, out of money?
0.0	0.450724866466	If you're running for president of the United States and you do not understand that we cannot defend this nation without more of our soldiers over there, you are not ready for this job.
0.0	0.450736034858	Unless you are clinically insane...
0.0	0.450741187143	OK. You know, the Democrats who have the ultimate super PAC, it's called the mainstream media.
0.0	0.450790904566	Do you remember when he ran for president of the United States, and he was a candidate, and he went and said, "These Americans with traditional values, they are bitter people, and they cling to their guns and to their religion."
0.0	0.450848531947	That's why I've been leading the fight to stop it.
0.0	0.451539617319	But, here is the truth.
0.0	0.4519732566	We need to incent private savings and make sure that Social Security is protected for those that have it.
0.0	0.452193781559	Thank you, senator.
0.0	0.452300328391	And he allows states to go ahead and do whatever they want on a substance that's illegal.
0.0	0.452496054108	You can't send your troops into harm's way unless you give them every opportunity to be successful.
0.0	0.452568727027	It's all about getting people to listen to one another's problems.
0.0	0.452760100424	You know the nice thing about the mainstream media, they don't hide their views.
0.0	0.452842051391	Before this, I was a very successful person as a developer and as a businessman.
0.0	0.453101104484	I looked at the evidence.
1.0	0.453194955817	The blurb said that the next president of the United States has got to be aggressive in bringing people into the political process.
0.0	0.45321601192	Instead, the Washington establishment raised both.
0.0	0.45321667805	He's wrong.
0.0	0.453725227748	And we're going to just fix everything with waste, fraud, and abuse?
0.0	0.453821187025	Our country doesn't win anymore.
0.0	0.453847096629	It will lead to even greater war in this world.
0.0	0.454104084528	And you know, when you see Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and all the Democrats talking about wanting to address the plight of working women, not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama, 3.7 million women have entered poverty.
0.0	0.454131252586	In the same light, as the foreign leader, Winston Churchill's politics were not my politics.
0.0	0.45443268429	It's called the mainstream media who every single day...
0.0	0.454447956352	Just like getting rid of Medicare and Medicaid.
0.0	0.454522670361	Well, one of us ran against Barack Obama.
0.0	0.454590300065	But they can't get along.
0.0	0.454769745197	You think about the regulatory cost and the tax cost -- that's why small businesses are closing, rather than being formed in our country right now.
0.0	0.454822798128	And so he undermines the Constitution, and he undermines free enterprise by expanding government, and he betrays our allies and cuts deals with our enemies and guts our military.
0.0	0.454875186436	We would still have sexism preventing women from getting equal pay.
1.0	0.454921792846	When we have more people in jail, disproportionately African American and Latino, than China does, a communist authoritarian society four times our size.
0.0	0.454927456224	For example, all right, who in America denies that we have an infrastructure that is crumbling?
0.0	0.455038639078	We have to do this in unison with the Arab world.
0.0	0.455086713455	Now, when it mattered, he stood up and took on Wall Street.
0.0	0.455098856931	They didn't do that either.
0.0	0.455175430413	Ours was intended to be a citizen government.
0.0	0.455230157642	When I'm president of the United States, we are defending the Second Amendment, not undermining it the way Barack Obama does.
0.0	0.455456964785	You lead and you produce results.
0.0	0.455636273939	The wages that high school graduates receive today are significantly less, whether you are white or black, than they used to be.
0.0	0.45568488101	Let me concur with the secretary, no question women's rights are under fierce attack all over this country.
0.0	0.45585567118	... tariffs that come against us.
0.0	0.455909214162	They do celebrate more dependence on the government.
0.0	0.45599044915	Because Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama.
0.0	0.456048777899	We had this failed red line with Assad and it discouraged folks that want to help us on the ground.
0.0	0.456256644143	And I have the feeling you're going to find a lot of cost overruns there and a lot of waste and duplicative activities.
0.0	0.456324358514	And by the way, I hope we can end the trade embargo with Cuba as well.
0.0	0.456405834435	You know, Hillary Clinton's always saying how Republicans don't follow science?
0.0	0.456576310291	And the reason is simple: because in 2008, we elected as president someone who wasn't interested in fixing America.
0.0	0.456811010323	I've done it once in Washington, with great jobs and lower taxes.
0.0	0.457082033617	Without China, North Korea doesn't even eat.
0.0	0.457291406084	The agreement on a cease-fire, though, is something that has to be implemented more quickly than the schedule that the Russians agreed to.
0.0	0.457364610211	Companies should, if they want to attract the best workers, provide a good set of benefits.
0.0	0.457404093884	Every time we send signals like this, we send a signal of weakness, not strength.
0.0	0.457491484614	But what is to prevent a future liberal president or a liberal Congress from coming back and not just raising the income tax, but also raising that VAT tax, and that vat tax is really bad for seniors.
0.0	0.457514359746	Here's a fact.
0.0	0.457712758469	I can't speak for the Koch Brothers, you're referring to a Super PAC that we don't coordinate with, that was set up to support President Obama, that has now decided that they want to support me.
0.0	0.45778203093	Middle class may notice it when they get to the cash register.
0.0	0.45790409988	They shouldn't automatically assume that because you believe that marriage is between one man and one woman that you are a homophobe.
0.0	0.458317278002	We've got a president who instead says, we're going to change hearts and minds.
1.0	0.458318126699	It looked like very few women.
0.0	0.458387972149	But I think a pause on Syrian refugees has been exactly right for all the governors that have called for it, and also, of course, for me as the governor of Ohio.
0.0	0.458660560598	This debate needs to be about the men and women across this country that are struggling on a daily basis to provide for their families the better future that we've always said this country is all about.
0.0	0.45888382504	I was a child of Ronald Reagan.
0.0	0.458921225435	You just have to look today at Indonesia, bombings all over.
1.0	0.458985218058	And let us be clear that every proposal that I have introduced has been paid for.
0.0	0.458993021835	I don't think anybody has cut that much government anywhere, at any time.
0.0	0.4592793917	Here is the case, they both agree, they can't make a deal.
0.0	0.459424807256	Terrorism is on the run, China, Russia is advancing their agenda at warp speed, and we pull back.
0.0	0.459765591336	Marco Rubio, why don't you resign?
0.0	0.459771876357	Take it to the bank.
0.0	0.460521895379	The first thing is we have to strengthen our alliances around the world.
0.0	0.460582011778	Every election we talk about Medicare and Social Security reform.
0.0	0.460584860404	Every progressive economist who has analyzed that says that the numbers don't add up, and that's a promise that cannot be kept, and it's really important now that we are getting into the rest of the country that both of us are held to account for explaining what we are proposing because, especially with healthcare, this is not about math.
0.0	0.460593693098	You will also have to means-test the benefits and declare there's not enough money.
0.0	0.460741722449	And that's just not acceptable.
0.0	0.460789032043	And we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid.
0.0	0.461003105475	Our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.0	0.461003989882	The reality is that both the African-American community and the white community do marijuana at about equal rates.
0.0	0.461065136778	Senator Cruz is precisely right.
0.0	0.461323866094	I'm 44 years old.
0.0	0.461811149232	We can reform those entitlements, we can change that corporate tax code and lower it.
0.0	0.462319803325	But somehow for decades, nothing really has changed.
1.0	0.462409276337	I think under President Obama we have seen a lot of advances, the Affordable Care Act has helped more African Americans than any other group to get insurance, to be taken care of, but we also know a lot more than we did.
0.0	0.462620360202	We don't have procurement being done for refreshing the equipment.
0.0	0.462693622181	We need to arm the Kurds the directly.
0.0	0.462729198427	Well, as you know, I'm a former elected prosecutor, a former elected attorney general, trained at the University of Virginia in constitutional law, and I don't believe in litmus tests except this.
1.0	0.462926431273	That's wrong.
0.0	0.463161404824	Credibility counts.
0.0	0.46329197389	My point is this.
0.0	0.46337563166	Why in God's name does Wall Street make huge campaign contributions?
1.0	0.463381097989	The bad news is, we have 470,000 going out of business every year.
0.0	0.463449364577	We agree that Wall Street should never be allowed to wreck Main Street again.
0.0	0.463625390904	And loose money is one of the major problems.
0.0	0.463675613483	As a matter of fact, if you're Hispanic or African-American in Texas, you have the number one high school graduation rates in America.
0.0	0.46368743967	Everytime they got a paycheck, the government reached in and took something out of it before they ever saw it.
0.0	0.463781170458	And so much of what we did -- to force competition, to use technology, to stand down the special interest groups -- can you imagine taking Medicaid from 10 to 2.5 percent?
0.0	0.463791123503	So when Nikki said that, I wasn't offended.
0.0	0.463888581429	They have to come into this country legally.
0.0	0.464115963387	I'd consider it.
0.0	0.464309204857	The question was, would you meet with an adversary without conditions?
0.0	0.464359534857	She is still defending Planned Parenthood, and she is still her party's frontrunner.
0.0	0.464536401346	I want to reverse that decline.
0.0	0.464553884604	Well, I was pleased that NATO announced just this week that they're going to start doing patrols in the Mediterranean, in the Aegean, to try to interdict the smugglers, to try to prevent the kind of tragedies that we have seen all too often, also to try to prevent more refugees from coming to the European Union.
0.0	0.464814600104	We have more Americans out of work or just Americans who quit looking for work for 40 years.
0.0	0.464874476027	... you know, the -- the -- the fact of the matter is -- you know, if we fix the taxation system, make it absolutely fair, and get rid of the incredible regulations -- because every regulation is a tax, it's a -- on goods and services.
0.0	0.464907817245	But guess who pushed for that regulation?
0.0	0.464955628264	I cannot tell you how much our nation is threatened and how we need a commander in chief who understands the threats to this nation.
0.0	0.465036126304	And in that meeting, I suggested we had a problem with technology, and that I wanted to take people from Silicon Valley into the Pentagon to solve our most significant problems.
0.0	0.465372821802	Three pages is about the maximum that a single business owner or a farmer or just a couple can understand without hiring somebody.
0.0	0.465418988086	They can't -- when they order the product and when they finally get the product it is taxed.
0.0	0.4654707033	If I'm elected president, we will not let in refugees from countries controlled by ISIS or Al Qaida.
0.0	0.465481745881	I mean, that's just the bottom line.
0.0	0.465576059726	You know what he said to me?

0.0	0.499088817397	You had only 21 Republican governors in this country.
0.0	0.499326169861	Where basically, businesses now will have to pay a tax, both on the money they make, but they also have to pay taxes on the money that they pay their employees.

0.0	0.628391152643	And the last piece is this.

0.0	0.639457256059	I've seen so much of it - a Soviet Union, the coming down of a wall, the issues that we saw around the world in Central America, the potential spread of communism, and 9/11 and Gulf War.
0.0	0.640154811951	There is no money, it's a stack of paper.
