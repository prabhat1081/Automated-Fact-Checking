0.0	0.107494798385	Kathie, I think -- Kathie the...
0.0	0.111147244823	... but wait a minute...
0.0	0.113300174317	And I don't think you have to be a politician to tell the truth.
0.0	0.119792062786	And that's a tragedy because now...
0.0	0.120755201543	And then when we win that, and we will win that against ISIS as it settles down, and we should leave.
0.0	0.123427613791	You know, maybe they're dumb and they don't know what they're going to get, but I don't think so.
0.0	0.124712934879	I think any parent would be so proud of them.
0.0	0.126123398726	I think that is...
0.0	0.126573522144	Do you know where I'm going, Kevin?
0.0	0.131782421366	If we don't know who you are, or why you're coming, you will not get into the United States.
0.0	0.135572445837	But I want to be frank about what I stand for.
0.0	0.135700726757	They want to trigger an apocalyptic Armageddon showdown.
0.0	0.135725242842	Chris...
0.0	0.136577553348	And I think this is an important question.
0.0	0.138768395103	So I hope and pray and cannot wait until this state and others give me an opportunity to serve this party as its nominee because I will defeat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.141356077001	And that's why I've been clear, when I am the president of the United States of America, we don't know who you are, and we don't know why you're trying to come to the United States, you are not going to get in, because the radical threat that we now face from ISIS is extraordinary and unprecedented...
0.0	0.14584397121	We listen to you and -- and then we act.
0.0	0.146466110249	Well, there are so many, I don't know where to start.
0.0	0.147641605663	I've heard a lot about me in this debate, and I'm going to keep talking and thinking about all of you because ultimately, I think the president's job is to do everything possible, everything that she can do to lift up the people of this country.
0.0	0.149439325823	We need to define the enemy.
0.0	0.14966139284	I think if you do not understand that our Judeo-Christian values are one of the reasons why America is such a special country, you don't understand our history.
0.0	0.150952613856	Historically, it is important to try to understand your adversary in order to figure out how they are thinking, what they will be doing, how they will react.
0.0	0.15141778596	Yes, I agree.
0.0	0.151425688097	What we need is leadership in this country which revitalizes American democracy, and makes people understand that if they stand up and fight back and take on the billionaire class, we can bring about the change that we need.
0.0	0.152253407736	It was an excruciating experience.
0.0	0.152896886487	Thank you Chris...
0.0	0.153060654494	... and when I'm president, we are keeping ISIS out of America.
0.0	0.154083466875	But I think if we're ever going to really tackle the problems posed by jihadi extreme terrorism, we need to understand it and realize that it has antecedents to what happened in Iraq and we have to continue to be vigilant about it.
0.0	0.154893997067	And we have no quarrel with the Iranian people.
0.0	0.155165520958	(APPLAUSE) I think that is the -- I think that's the conservative consensus pragmatic approach to how to solve this problem.
0.0	0.157804482637	We need to rebuild the military to defeat the enemy.
0.0	0.158389772424	And you should hope that our next president is someone that is influence by their faith.
0.0	0.160107798266	And when I'm president, I can tell you this, my faith will not just influence the way I'll govern as president, it will influence the way I live my life.
0.0	0.160624745237	But if we don't know right and wrong, I think we have lost our way.
0.0	0.16192802326	I think we become unmoored and I think without the religious foundation that guides us all, I think we have a great risk of going horribly in the wrong direction.
0.0	0.162671046539	So they clearly think I'm going to do what I say I will do and you can look at what I did in the Senate.
0.0	0.163788133256	Well, I think that they're be pretty smart, because I think a lot of the states will do the right thing, and I think those states that don't will pay a heavy penalty.
0.0	0.164345148007	Oh, great.
0.0	0.165942208685	And, I'm going to tell you exactly how we're going to deal with it when I am president.
0.0	0.167380980403	I will do everything I can as president to get that accomplished.
0.0	0.167920869401	OK.
0.0	0.16940609413	I'm glad he has produced enormous enthusiasm, and, every Donald Trump voter or potential voter, I hope to earn your support.
0.0	0.16972994207	And that's what I will do as your president.
0.0	0.169776300213	And now, like never before, we need our Muslim American neighbors to stand up and to -- and to be a part of this.
0.0	0.17183649761	... Chris, keep it coming...
0.0	0.172324304994	We have -- I don't know that there's any disagreement here...
0.0	0.173068267302	And I cannot wait to earn the opportunity to do it because she cannot be the president of the United States.
0.0	0.173437867748	But I think on the broader question of religion and politics, you know, I think liberty, itself requires a virtue -- requires a virtuous people.
0.0	0.174019578201	We want to be the United States of America.
0.0	0.174019578201	We want to be the United States of America.
0.0	0.174046031826	And who's compromised and who is principled.
0.0	0.174130576574	That is what is going to have to happen, if we want to revitalize and rebuild the crumbling middle class.
0.0	0.174566044372	And I think that's a mistake, and I just don't think Marco can have it both ways.
0.0	0.174691432725	You're not going to hear a lot of polished political speech from me, but you will hear the truth.
0.0	0.175453311361	As president of the United States, that is exactly what I will do.
0.0	0.175838051306	And what is missing is the political will, because too many Democrats and, sadly, too many Republicans don't want to solve this problem.
0.0	0.175910843336	And this is why you need to send someone from outside of Washington to Washington.
0.0	0.177623525621	Yeah, but let me respond...
0.0	0.177742132474	I mean, you know, let's not be naive about it.
0.0	0.178041236714	The Shi'a-Sunni split.
0.0	0.178293919368	Okay, thank you.
0.0	0.178321965426	Listen, I think that what people should do is use their common sense.
0.0	0.179137217508	But wait, I just want to say this Senator.
0.0	0.179686476562	I think God has blessed this country with enormous natural resources, and we should pursue all of the above.
0.0	0.180347660405	Look, we need more Americans to be involved in the political process.
0.0	0.180787519046	That's not the America that I think we should be.
0.0	0.18078810031	And there are many ways of doing it.
0.0	0.180966522296	I think we need to put in some armored brigades there.
0.0	0.180987577181	Parents, and sons, and daughters and family members, and as our hearts go out to them and as our prayers go out to them, we must remember this, that this isn't the new face of conflict and warfare, not in the 20th century but the new face of conflict and warfare in the 21st century.
0.0	0.181168732312	It is not tough talk.
0.0	0.18135783515	Well, I believe, and I know that if Iowa helps make me the Republican nominee, I will defeat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.181999011423	I think they'd want to hear it.
0.0	0.183100998219	And, I'll tell you one other thing, you know why the Republican party will want to take a chance on me?
0.0	0.183543080373	He's an entertaining guy.
0.0	0.183980135471	I feel like I need -- I feel like I need a Washington to English dictionary converter, right?
0.0	0.184124122716	Well, I'll tell you who is on my side.
0.0	0.185860943396	And that this world, with American leadership, can and must come together to destroy them.
0.0	0.186780821019	And, you know, I don't know all the details of what Rick Snyder has done.
0.0	0.187039767065	Well John, wait a minute.
0.0	0.188025937187	Can I -- can I -- I just...
0.0	0.1887464971	That's American capitalism.
0.0	0.189316670393	Look, first of all, I recognize that Vladimir Putin is an opportunist and he's a bully, and we have to face him down.
0.0	0.189397141933	You know, I like Marco.
0.0	0.189517304818	Now we hear the tough talk.
0.0	0.189648209774	... Chris, your questions that you...
0.0	0.190947619956	And yes, when I am president of the United States, if there is some place in this country where radical jihadists are planning to attack the United States, we will go after them wherever they are, and if we capture them alive, they are going to Guantanamo.
0.0	0.191166146347	I kind of miss Donald Trump.
0.0	0.191383976657	And I know that term gets my Republican friends nervous.
0.0	0.192567744431	Hillary doesn't want to run against me, but I cannot wait to run against her.
0.0	0.192658941338	Afghanistan is a mess.
0.0	0.193358466058	As president I will restore and rebuild our military, restore the alliances and keep us safe.
0.0	0.193442890206	... Well, no, no.
0.0	0.193545182343	Well, Chris, I'm glad to discuss my views on ethanol and energy.
0.0	0.193594048563	Talk about what?
0.0	0.194326254575	I would say that on this issue, I'm a little bit more conservative than the Secretary...
0.0	0.194736266499	And I'll tell you what I'm worried about -- I'm worried about money.
0.0	0.195069772331	And for the sake of our economy, they must -- the major banks must be broken up.
0.0	0.19750903275	Who do you know will defend life, marriage and religious liberty?
0.0	0.198070799935	I do think that it's important to defend it.
0.0	0.198079714106	And I'll tell you, Bret, I think that's a much more attractive vision for healthcare than the Washington-drive, top-down Obamacare that is causing so many millions of people to hurt.
0.0	0.198618972689	And many of the fights that are going on are not ones that the United States has either started or have a role in.
0.0	0.198813248726	Yes -- thank you.
0.0	0.199726296449	He doesn't want to hear the talk about politics Megyn and who is establishment and who is grassroots.
0.0	0.200489997698	But I had to stand up and come back and get the best that we could.
0.0	0.20125575483	And the fact is that we need a commander-in- chief who not only understands how to protect us, but feels in here what it means to face the possibility of loss.
0.0	0.204036785352	It all will be scrutinized.
0.0	0.205014207354	There is no challenge too great for the United States to confront, provided we have the ability and the courage to put forward new leadership that can move us to those better and safer and more prosperous days.
0.0	0.205162233117	Caucus for me on Monday night because if I am your nominee, I will unite this party and I will defeat Hillary Clinton and when I'm president, America's light will shine again and the 21 century will be a new American century.
0.0	0.205423792078	Break them up.
0.0	0.206280112761	That's what we need to do as a nation.
0.0	0.206302023104	And no matter what your faith is, that's what I want you to be able to do.
0.0	0.206371705931	Well, Chris, I will apologize to nobody for the vigorousness with which I will fight terrorism, go after ISIS, hunt them down wherever they are, and utterly and completely destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.206551417498	I'll keep -- I'll keep heading in that direction, believe me.
0.0	0.206896818176	... And start taking advice...
0.0	0.206947406532	We the people of the United States in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare and secure the benefits of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this constitution of the United States of America.
0.0	0.20729349904	But it cannot be an American fight.
0.0	0.208668079495	You can -- you can deal with the threat of terror and also recognize that this country should be aspirational across the board.
0.0	0.20887528105	I intend to do the exact same thing to defeat radical Islamic terrorism --
0.0	0.208967024958	I do believe that people who are trying to come to the United States -- this country has a right to know who they are and why they are coming.
0.0	0.210000789438	So I'm confident if I win this nomination, I will aggressively go against her and beat her.
0.0	0.210147377528	Chris?
0.0	0.211971879694	Stop the Washington bull and let's get things done.
0.0	0.21216525996	Well, let me tell you what the country should really be worried about.
0.0	0.212279898026	I'm running hard and I believe I'll be the Republican nominee and I'll be the one best suited to beat Hillary Clinton, who should not be president of the United States.
0.0	0.212378895514	But they need to be absolutely clear about where they stand.
0.0	0.212514383591	You can change your mind.
0.0	0.212638928436	But, you know, we are blessed with tremendous energy in this nation, and we need to be looking for new sources of energy.
0.0	0.213362725961	The fact of the matter is -- and let's say it in our debate, because you'll never hear this from that immigration-bashing carnival barker, Donald Trump, the truth of the matter is...
0.0	0.213453172829	And I will be laying out in detail, what I think we need to do with our friends and allies in Europe and elsewhere to do a better job of coordinating efforts against the scourge of terrorism.
0.0	0.214014422705	John, I think somewhere between...
0.0	0.214145583384	I don't think so.
0.0	0.214265999909	When I am president of the United States of America, there will never be any cap-and-trade in the United States.
0.0	0.214301586316	And frankly, if you want to be commander in chief, you have to have the experience.
0.0	0.21430368488	And a lot of people are doing that.
0.0	0.214591191604	You know, need to stop allowing political correctness to dictate our policies, because it's going to kill us if we don't.
0.0	0.214810755705	Washington is broken.
0.0	0.214844026611	If you want to make it into the middle class -- I'm not saying in all cases -- we need plumbers, and we need carpenters, and electricians, that's for sure, and they should get help as well.
0.0	0.215159061319	And I'm so grateful for the diligence, for the seriousness with which the men and women of Iowa approach this process.
0.0	0.215335786994	And it is imperative that we do more not only to help our friends and partners protect themselves and protect our own homeland, but also to work to try to deal with this arc of instability, which does have a lot of impact on what happens in a country like Libya.
0.0	0.215542785294	And when you see a problem, you must act quickly to get on top of it.
0.0	0.21562578891	We serve you.
0.0	0.216232406524	If I am elected president...
0.0	0.217014649785	You know, I've always had a great deal of respect.
0.0	0.217030135	That's why when I'm president we are going to rebuild our intelligence capabilities.
0.0	0.217108155255	So we have a unique opportunity to bring everybody together.
0.0	0.217114101369	So, I want to look at the whole problem and that's why my proposal is much more comprehensive than anything else that's been put forth.
0.0	0.217717635715	And in talking to a lot of our neighbors who are in that super wealthy, millionaire and billionaire category, a great numbers of them love their country enough to do more again in order to create more opportunity for America's middle class.
0.0	0.217794464586	But it will be...
0.0	0.217898210644	I agree completely.
0.0	0.218780719471	We need to mobilize the entire country to treat our veterans and treat them with much more respect than they get today.
0.0	0.218855456715	I like how you stand up.
0.0	0.219168807448	We need to bring together our European and our Sunni Arab allies, and we need to develop a strategy together to take on ISIS every place that it is around the world, so that together, all of us can take ISIS out, destroy it, and then move on to come back to our country, protect our homeland security and make sure that the American people are safe.
0.0	0.219275706393	When I'm president, that will change.
0.0	0.219281789569	I think, frankly, if you have border security, you can have legalization.
0.0	0.219646868447	When you talk about the long-term consequences of war, let's talk about the men and women who came home from war.
0.0	0.219783701526	Everybody is under fire and under attack, and we have to stand together as an alliance.
0.0	0.220302720103	So, we do need to take on the Republicans very clearly and directly.
0.0	0.220867943796	And I believe only with a strong America will we defeat this radical group, this apocalyptic group called ISIS.
0.0	0.221389418309	It -- it doesn't need to be that way.
0.0	0.221719988432	The issue is -- I believe, and I believe this honestly, and I don't know that there's much difference on guns between us.
0.0	0.222666615686	They can do business with Iran, or they can do business with America, and I am very confident they're going to choose America before they choose the Iranian economy.
0.0	0.222905985153	... that stage, and that is exactly what I am ready to do.
0.0	0.223343495829	And they have a desire not simply to conquer the Middle East and to become the dominant power in that region, but ultimately to be able to hold America hostage.
0.0	0.223409854824	Oh, yes there is.
0.0	0.224244850784	And so in no way have I ever said that I don't embrace my father or love my father or appreciate everything that he has done for the country.
0.0	0.224311721859	But just as importantly, and I agree with what John said.
0.0	0.224612595543	We know about the Brits.
0.0	0.224632525516	We know about the Belgians.
0.0	0.224660565959	That's what should be done.
0.0	0.224999071755	And, I'll tell you something else.
0.0	0.226216079878	And it isn't because I'm all that great.
0.0	0.226911737025	And we are going to be able to defeat ISIS on the ground there, as well as in this world, because of the Muslim Americans in our country and throughout the world who understand that this brutal and barbaric group is perverting the name of a great world religion.
0.0	0.227029027509	I don't think the term is what's important.
0.0	0.227472551922	Ted can change his mind.
0.0	0.227650499952	Everybody knows that.
0.0	0.227731102686	We desperately need a conservative leader as president of the United States.
0.0	0.227768542474	Yeah, but look.
0.0	0.228232503983	And that is what we have done in Ohio.
0.0	0.228285695725	I know, Bret.
0.0	0.228314066152	But they should have the right of determine -- self-determination.
0.0	0.22855541485	And as our party's nominee, I will defeat Hillary Clinton in November.
0.0	0.229092224626	And, you know, take advantage of the tremendous opportunities in energy that God has given us, not get involved in these little petty arguments.
0.0	0.229289568596	I think something has to change.
0.0	0.229382878697	I'm going to be independent.
0.0	0.229798066183	If you -- we will not solve our nation's problems by resorting to the divisive ideologies of our past, or by returning to polarizing figures from our past.
0.0	0.229850205174	I think with this kind of barbarism and nihilism, it's very hard to understand, other than the lust for power, the rejection of modernity, the total disregard for human rights, freedom, or any other value that we know and respect.
0.0	0.229899826997	And what we need to do is bring people together to work on the agreement where there is broad consensus and that's what I intend to do.
0.0	0.230458847117	I agree with that.
0.0	0.230562360565	And guess what?
0.0	0.231072367609	I think we all support that.
0.0	0.231117987268	We've got the consensus, what we're lacking is political leadership...
0.0	0.231882475049	And it is easy to talk the talk about ending Citizens United, but what I think we need to do is show by example that we are prepared to not rely on large corporations and Wall Street for campaign contributions, and that's what I'm doing.
0.0	0.231942030691	And now mom and dad can stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.
0.0	0.232721635539	But what happened at the university there, what's happening at other universities, I think reflects the deep sense of, you know, concern, even despair that so many young people, particularly of color, have...
0.0	0.232931799195	Well, I -- if I might.
0.0	0.233822881477	They would like to rip it up and start all over again, throw our nation back into this really contentious debate that we've had about health care for quite some time now.
0.0	0.233826026449	Thank you, Marco.
0.0	0.233911728851	We do have to take a hard look at the defense budget and we do have to figure out how we get ready to fight the adversaries of the future, not the past.
0.0	0.233960711949	I'd like to take a matter of personal privilege here...
0.0	0.234041133204	You know, I think abortion is always wrong.
0.0	0.234316814267	But the Iranian leader, their supreme leader is a radical Shia cleric who has an apocalyptic vision of the future.
0.0	0.235183506223	But...
0.0	0.235201963656	I know everyone else on this stage hopes to earn your support.
0.0	0.235511219824	But John, let's not fall into the trap of thinking that all of our Muslim American neighbors in this country are somehow our enemies here.
0.0	0.235901433078	Well, thank you, John.
0.0	0.236018368104	So, I mean this may seem like a bit of an arcane discussion.
0.0	0.23632414735	But we don't see it happening at all.
0.0	0.236733391693	Now, secondly, let me say I'm a maniac and everyone on this stage is stupid, fat, and ugly.
0.0	0.237356653139	Well, let me be clear, if Donald engages in insults or anybody else, I don't intend to reciprocate.
0.0	0.237413087107	I will...
0.0	0.237534534686	But the bottom line is we must have virtue, we must have a religious bearing as a nation.
0.0	0.238104666579	That can be done.
0.0	0.238176437856	... What was your question...
0.0	0.238186826777	You want to make the Veterans Administration do a better job, give them -- give veterans choices and you'll get a much better result.
0.0	0.238201015837	America is best when we are actually standing up to evil in this world.
0.0	0.238434601349	They want to say they're getting some of the liberty vote.
0.0	0.238631749839	And I will also go after executives who are responsible for the decisions that have such bad consequences for our country.
0.0	0.238641784868	But, more importantly, to train a Sunni-led force in Syria to take out ISIS with our support...
0.0	0.238644032703	It is the future of the world and the future of our children and grandchildren.
0.0	0.239602210807	I think that there are many other reasons why it has in addition to what happened in the region, but I don't think that the United States has the bulk of the responsibility.
0.0	0.239779582704	There is no reason why you can't stand for principles, go and fight for them and be able also, to have to get things done in government.
0.0	0.2399791878	We've gotten off the Hillary's e-mails, good.
0.0	0.240349498257	This entire question was an attack, but that's (inaudible)
0.0	0.240661982879	I feel like...
0.0	0.24077962232	But here's something that I believe we have to do as we put together an international coalition, and that is we have to understand that the Muslim nations in the region -- Saudi Arabia, Iran, Turkey, Jordan -- all of these nations, they're going to have to get their hands dirty, their boots on the ground.
0.0	0.240786920935	Chris, please attack Ted.
0.0	0.241003419941	Yeah.
0.0	0.241003419941	Yeah.
0.0	0.241003419941	Yeah.
0.0	0.241206426115	But what we need to do is turn it over to the regional powers to be able to handle that.
0.0	0.241693942169	And I will always allow my faith to influence everything I do.
0.0	0.241938245302	Let me hear if there's any difference between the Secretary and myself.
0.0	0.2427892521	But Megyn...
0.0	0.24308788641	You know, we all have our own individual interpretations of our faith.
0.0	0.243207724172	Look--
0.0	0.24351969146	And it's-- it's a worthy debate.
0.0	0.243731039861	It's really a question for all of us to answer, every single one of our children deserves the chance to live up to his or her god-given potential.
0.0	0.243973122902	And we need someone who will take on Hillary Clinton in November.
0.0	0.244198052735	Sure.
0.0	0.244578866026	But this cannot be an American fight, although American leadership is essential.
0.0	0.244621362997	At the same time we're doing all that, the Pentagon must be reformed so we get what we need for our men and women in uniform.
0.0	0.244847477296	You don't serve us.
0.0	0.245137591571	But I certainly think that the United States should take its full responsibility in helping those people.
0.0	0.245582986501	And Ben, you're a terrible surgeon.
0.0	0.246243155358	I'll take that, too.
0.0	0.246891544801	For her convenience.
0.0	0.247402951407	I talked to a diplomat from Belgium.
0.0	0.247514561837	I think we're at war with jihadists who have --
0.0	0.248026831958	I think we have a disagreement, and the disagreement is that not only did I vote against the war in Iraq.
0.0	0.249518129897	It should always be going up.
0.0	0.249839848069	The Secretary's obviously right.
0.0	0.249878569191	Jeb, please attack Ted..."
0.0	0.249883756138	I'm going to support you, and I think that is absolutely appropriate.
0.0	0.250024181233	It's perfectly legal in this country to change your mind.
0.0	0.250217093744	You see, ladies and gentlemen, at the end of the day, I'm an optimist
0.0	0.25119747437	I think the issue here is -- and I applaud Secretary Clinton.
0.0	0.251318410253	Didn't just happen.
0.0	0.251581168662	Now, there has been a lot of turmoil and trouble as they have tried to deal with these radical elements which you find in this arc of instability, from north Africa to Afghanistan.
0.0	0.252041889432	It cannot solely be America's fight.
0.0	0.252112945196	But I would say that if you want to defend the country, it begins with border security.
0.0	0.252157228404	So there's a lot of work we need to do and I want to be sure what's called the AUMF, has the authority that is needed going forward.
0.0	0.252241651852	But what -- I will tell you this.
0.0	0.252392788822	Examine our records, pray on it and I will be honored if you and your family will come caucus for us on Monday night.
0.0	0.252564989699	...
0.0	0.252564989699	...
0.0	0.252564989699	...
0.0	0.252564989699	...
0.0	0.252564989699	...
0.0	0.252564989699	...
0.0	0.252564989699	...
0.0	0.252564989699	...
0.0	0.252564989699	...
0.0	0.253831147896	Well, I mean, I was talked about in the question.
0.0	0.253881595886	But Bret, here's the problem.
0.0	0.254001727971	I think on Article V of NATO, we would definitely protect all of our allies.
0.0	0.254022641251	There won't be any -- you can get it.
0.0	0.254255479605	They will never again support it, and that's wrong for our country, bad for our future.
0.0	0.25468429846	I think the only argument is are we a sovereign country, are we not allowed to choose who comes in, when they come in and how they come in?
0.0	0.254763422734	So, there does need to be a whole of government approach, but just because we're involved and we have a strategy doesn't mean we're going to be able to dictate the outcome.
0.0	0.254848102707	We can build the fence.
0.0	0.255250254618	But when you're a governor, you have to admit it.
0.0	0.256929763644	I don't want immigration reform to fail.
0.0	0.257299490878	He's a progressive economist.
0.0	0.257534738462	They're terrified by the saber rattling.
0.0	0.258040345962	We need much more than that.
0.0	0.258108393004	And number two, if we find out they're developing a nuclear weapon and we know how to get to it, we're gonna go take it out.
0.0	0.258265024023	So, I think it's important for us to be careful about the language we use, which is why I've been critical of Donald Trump.
0.0	0.258897294611	Let me do that but let me pick up on an issue, a very important issue that we have not yet discussed.
0.0	0.258952840879	But I would say this to you, Bret.
0.0	0.259285631655	Bret, we're just starting.
0.0	0.259379179521	Let's be frank here.
0.0	0.260067254889	And Secretary Clinton, unfortunately, is on the wrong side.
0.0	0.261553724547	You know, the situation is this.
0.0	0.261751630811	Our country deserves no less, because all of the other issues we want to deal with depend upon us being secure and strong.
0.0	0.262408298498	America is best when we work in collaboration with our allies.
0.0	0.262665849421	I think we need major reform in the military, making it more cost effective, but also focusing on the real crisis that faces us.
0.0	0.2630718517	Yes, we must protect our borders.
0.0	0.263846905161	And that's the difference between somebody who knows how to do this and somebody who's never done it before.
0.0	0.26392350657	Let me put those proposals-- and you're absolutely right.
0.0	0.263933836013	As such, everybody is welcome from any race, any country, any religion, if they want to be Americans.
0.0	0.264203047765	And, you know, that's been my message in New Hampshire.
1.0	0.264315891978	I think we need to stop taking our advice from economists on Wall Street...
0.0	0.265433275717	Right.
0.0	0.26589924187	That's exactly what I'll do as president of the United States.
0.0	0.266251058332	And we will always celebrate legal immigration like Dulce's great story.
0.0	0.266631936769	And we have to stop all the divisions.
0.0	0.266668614292	You will have welcomed my dad to preach at your churches.
0.0	0.266702639469	John, may I -- may I interject here?
0.0	0.266717811234	... and I think -- you know, Governor -- Jeb, you -- the attack that -- the authorization that Barack Obama asked for was not against ISIS.
0.0	0.266998743843	Now I am the only candidate up here that doesn't have a super PAC.
0.0	0.267000412748	As a Catholic, that's what I want to do.
0.0	0.267070656066	I think we ought to put in our missile defense system.
0.0	0.267748096579	Go on to martinomalley.com.
0.0	0.267879451709	... and I'd like to respond.
0.0	0.268266159549	What that is, is just common sense.
0.0	0.268446887715	And we can do it again together, all of us, to strengthen this country, work together.
0.0	0.268703999728	Thank you.
0.0	0.268703999728	Thank you.
0.0	0.268703999728	Thank you.
0.0	0.268703999728	Thank you.
0.0	0.268703999728	Thank you.
0.0	0.268703999728	Thank you.
0.0	0.268892424174	Thank you very much.
0.0	0.269269378723	Thank you very, very much.
0.0	0.269905429698	Well, I agree with Rand that I very much respect Ron Paul and that I think anyone who is able to win in the Republican Party has to be able to bring together the disparate elements of the Reagan coalition.
0.0	0.27013364107	Marco can change his mind.
0.0	0.270421622119	Again, with all do respect to Secretary Clinton...
0.0	0.270486365832	We need a leader that will fix things and have a proven record to do it.
0.0	0.270655497236	Well, as anyone knows who's been listening to me, you know?
0.0	0.270828625656	I still want to get back to health care, because I think that's a worthy topic to explore.
0.0	0.271099199872	So did you, Marco.
0.0	0.271195229695	That's what really matters.
0.0	0.271375569299	Well, John, I think that we have to look at ISIS as the leading threat of an international terror network.
0.0	0.27153356924	Wait a minute, he has basically used his answer to impune my integrity.
0.0	0.271662460629	The mentally ill?
0.0	0.271889261692	And I had to confront the possibility of being a single parent.
0.0	0.272084658073	... we will secure the border...
0.0	0.272631879018	But I can tell you this.
0.0	0.272740139854	And I think what the president has consistently said-- which I agree with-- is that we will support those who take the fight to ISIS.
0.0	0.272898765399	We can do that.
0.0	0.272898765399	You can do both.
0.0	0.273092328426	And we can get a lot of them out if we get the government out of our lives.
0.0	0.273217179515	It's not about Donald Trump.
0.0	0.273394688801	I don't think the United States should be engaged in symbolic military activity.
0.0	0.274007385131	We need, very clearly, major, major reform in a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.274610959233	Look, I served on...
0.0	0.274951475853	We need a strategy to destroy ISIS there.
0.0	0.275081790646	It's an important one that we should be engaged in.
0.0	0.275354288501	I believe that the goal should be debt-free college.
0.0	0.275399274916	I don't think Ted can have it both ways.
0.0	0.275539704467	And, you know, I do think it's important to do exactly what Senator Sanders said, and that is to start talking about the issues that the American people really care about, and that they talk to each of us about.
0.0	0.275966832475	All of that together, we're going to be just fine and America is going to continue to lead the world.
0.0	0.276327163346	We don't want to be Sweden.
0.0	0.276605228547	But I don't want us to be painting with too broad a brush.
0.0	0.27662001842	That is what I want to do.
0.0	0.276673315565	That is why we have troops in Iraq that are helping to train and build back up the Iraqi military, why we have special operators in Syria working with the Kurds and Arabs, so that we can be supportive.
0.0	0.276760298729	And when I'm president, we are going to bring it under control once and for all after 30 years of talking about it.
0.0	0.276962135865	... And that I am not a great fan of regime change.
0.0	0.277828263749	We ought to be working to improve it and prevent Republicans from both underming it and even repealing it.
0.0	0.277842309225	Well, I think it's pretty clear that they know that I will.
0.0	0.278155579686	I need your help.
0.0	0.278155579686	I need your help.
0.0	0.278598672651	We need to deal with ISIS in the caliphate.
0.0	0.279507955849	I mean, let's talk about this arc of instability that Secretary Clinton talked about.
0.0	0.279644499513	Let me just...
0.0	0.279644499513	Let me just...
0.0	0.279809532111	And until that happens there's not going to be consensus on this issue.
0.0	0.27983681834	There are other ways to lead and to be a moral leader in this world, rather than at the opposite end of a drone strike.
0.0	0.279882703312	Iraq is a mess.
0.0	0.27993817851	Reestablish Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.280799349921	We can develop that, you know?
0.0	0.281394008656	This actually is America's fight.
0.0	0.281401784045	Maybe now we can get it moving again so that we can upgrade it so that it does include all the tools and everything in our arsenal that we can use to try to work with our allies and our friends, come up with better intelligence.
0.0	0.281412144295	More and more military personnel are leaving becoming veterans, and the waiting list grows.
0.0	0.281892949148	But, I don't believe that Washington should be picking winners and losers.
0.0	0.282308746252	But in order to bring about the changes that we need, we need a political revolution.
0.0	0.282351568523	... and say there is something more important than money.
0.0	0.282485491375	Marco, please attack Ted.
0.0	0.282761306171	...the only reason is -- look...
0.0	0.283233852345	We will -- when I am president of the United States, on my first day in office, we are canceling the deal with Iran, and nations will have to make a choice.
0.0	0.283353704788	Because I've seen so many things get accomplished in my lifetime.
0.0	0.2834613416	Look, I don't believe there's the model -- there's lots of good people that work in finance, Secretary Sanders, but Secretary Clinton, we need to step up and we need to protect Main Street from Wall Street and you can't do that by -- by campaigning as the candidate of Wall Street.
0.0	0.283641134892	Who are we kidding?
0.0	0.283807123215	There's a lot packed into that statement.
0.0	0.283828449278	You know, one of our biggest national security issues is the world looks at us some time, and we look at each other and say, why can't we solve problems?
0.0	0.284209004278	These are American soldiers and we fail them when we fail to take into account what happens the day after a dictator falls and when we fail to act with a whole of government approach with sustainable development, diplomacy, and our economic power in alignment with our principles.
0.0	0.28459886314	We need people who think out of the box and can solve problems; can utilize the resources around them; very smart people, to focus on the problem and solve the problem.
0.0	0.284981052495	And that's what we need to be doing to the best of our ability in our country.
0.0	0.285278532426	We took out the safe haven in Afghanistan, but now there is, undoubtedly, a larger safe haven and we must rise to this occasion in collaboration and with alliances to confront it, and invest in the future much better human intelligence so we know what the next steps are.
0.0	0.285296409583	I believe it is a right.
0.0	0.285351841094	And we need to be focused and lift the rules of engagement so we're not sending our fighting men and women into combat with their arms tied behind their backs.
0.0	0.285423869445	And they're going to tell us where the terrorists are.
0.0	0.285550522024	More importantly, I want kids in Burlington, Vermont, or Baltimore, Maryland, who are in the sixth grade or the eighth grade, who don't have a lot of money, whose parents -- like my parents -- may never have gone to college.
0.0	0.285744478438	Let me tell you who's not qualified to be President of the United States, Chris.
0.0	0.285857616908	You know, we probably have to figure out a way to make sure that we keep America safe.
0.0	0.28612571018	Let me just say this...
0.0	0.28651050214	It's great to be back.
0.0	0.286525668674	You see, we usually elect presidents in America that want to change the things that are wrong in America.
0.0	0.286952631973	No, they shouldn't.
0.0	0.287175413614	CLINTON: Oh, wait a minute, senator.
0.0	0.287284919606	I don't think we're at war with all Muslims.
0.0	0.287341021027	Because they know that Hillary Clinton will never be prosecuted by this justice department, and they're going to want to put a former federal prosecutor on the stage to prosecute her next September.
0.0	0.287610146436	But we have a unique time in America to connect with people all around the world that understand that there's an existential threat against all of them, the Arabs, the Jordanians, the Saudis, the Egyptians, our friends in Europe, including the Turks.
0.0	0.288109520008	This group needs to be confronted and defeated.
0.0	0.288351988363	That's right.
0.0	0.288351988363	That's right.
0.0	0.288351988363	That's right.
0.0	0.288559322499	... and to devote the resources from the booming economy to rebuilding our Navy, rebuilding our Air Force, rebuilding our Army and ensuring we have the capacity to keep this country safe.
0.0	0.289214631384	I believe that actually affordable college, debt-free college is the goal that we need to attain as a nation.
0.0	0.289227281174	Yes.
0.0	0.289227281174	Yes.
0.0	0.289227281174	Yes.
0.0	0.289227281174	Yes.
0.0	0.289227281174	Yes.
0.0	0.289227281174	Yes.
0.0	0.289227281174	Yes.
0.0	0.289227281174	Yes.
0.0	0.289227281174	Yes.
0.0	0.289372095986	And I've had many situations in the state of Ohio where we've had to move, whether it's storms, whether it was a horrible school shooting.
0.0	0.289479853339	Now, in fact, what we have got to do -- and I think there is widespread agreement here -- is the United States cannot do it alone.
0.0	0.290032942306	All right, Nancy, I really wish you'd come back to me on this on this one, John...
0.0	0.290045081257	I will work my heart out.
0.0	0.290049632178	Sit down with people like John Mccain.
0.0	0.290707754361	So there might be an occasion if we did overturn Roe v. Wade -- Roe v. Wade nationalized the issue.
0.0	0.291018041369	Who do you know will kill the terrorists, defend the constitution and repeal Obamacare?
0.0	0.291081648405	And that's the way it is.
0.0	0.291172426845	Look, the conservative message is economic growth and along with economic growth goes opportunity for everybody in America.
0.0	0.291179971331	Libya is now a mess.
0.0	0.291230613291	And I also have detailed plans to fix the mess in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.291326927759	I will be ready.
0.0	0.291350351589	She worked -- and many of us supported you -- in trying to rebuild that devastation.
0.0	0.291363816616	We need radical changes in mental health in America so somebody who is suicidal or homicidal can get the emergency care they need.
0.0	0.291473879634	That's fair game but that's where I'm going to focus.
0.0	0.29184085316	We had all kinds of questions that we discussed and, you know, at the end, I recommended to the president that we take the chance to do what we could to find out whether that was bin Laden and to finally bring him to justice.
0.0	0.29185697878	And I believe that Puerto Rico ought to have the right of self-determination.
0.0	0.291898791546	What he wants is something to get done.
0.0	0.292017869853	If not, they can stay where they are.
0.0	0.292170749976	You learn to constantly evaluate and understand the nature of the threats that you are being faced with.
0.0	0.29222435091	Well, I don't know about the GOP messaging, but I can tell you about my messaging.
0.0	0.292242377523	I want to thank everyone here for showing the men and women of Iowa the respect to show up and make the case to the people of this state and the people of the country why each of us believe we would make the best commander in chief.
0.0	0.292371512041	We talked about criminal justice reform.
0.0	0.292470323728	Here's the story.
0.0	0.292593386974	That is the issue.
0.0	0.293665713649	I kind of miss him.
0.0	0.293673925337	It was...
0.0	0.293911334032	They do not want us to exercise religious liberty.
0.0	0.29423779582	Let me...
0.0	0.29423779582	Let's...
0.0	0.294878292769	And then, with the revolution against Assad -- and I did early on say we needed to try to find a way to train and equip moderates very early so that we would have a better idea of how to deal with Assad because I thought there would be extremist groups filling the vacuum.
0.0	0.29552096473	That's the future of banking in America.
0.0	0.296010199356	He's very charming.
0.0	0.296139762526	Go ahead.
0.0	0.296262747301	But -- but we are going to end the absurdity, as Warren Buffet often remind us.
0.0	0.296703238431	Look, we have waiting lists for veterans that are -- that are leaving because of the sequester where we're gutting the military.
0.0	0.297236377067	You will be the first Americans that get to answer the fundamental question, what comes next for this country after seven disastrous years of Barack Obama?
0.0	0.297836481079	Barack Obama wants to change America.
0.0	0.298035240261	I think issues and substance, policy and vision and record should be the meat of politics.
0.0	0.298108526275	And we do have a role in this.
0.0	0.298193788856	So, yes, I'd absolutely would go in if he attacked.
0.0	0.298876256163	We need to have a resolve that will bring the world together to root out the kind of radical jihadist ideology that motivates organizations like ISIS, a barbaric, ruthless, violent jihadist terrorist group.
0.0	0.298963539544	You know, the mother of the young man with his friends in the car who was playing loud music and, you know, some older white man pulled out a gun and shot him because they wouldn't turn the radio down.
0.0	0.299053296644	And I know that securing our borders is not anti-immigrant and we will do it.
0.0	0.299096081177	O' Malley: John, please, it's-- personal privilege, John.
0.0	0.299224338146	And it is from the lessons from history that we do this because if we allow this to fester, we're going to have Islamic terrorism, multi-generations of it all across this country.
0.0	0.299492875408	So we've got to look at the full range and then come to some smart decisions about having more streamlined and focused approach.
0.0	0.299522485811	Listen, we can solve immigration.
0.0	0.299960240409	Here's what I believe.
0.0	0.300043575569	I looked at ways that the shareholders would have more control over what was going on in that arena.
0.0	0.300111528124	And I do not believe it's a good idea now.
0.0	0.300270335123	I wish he was here.
0.0	0.300288564519	They've been talking about this issue for 30 years, and nothing ever happens.
0.0	0.300722484216	So let's move toward what we should be doing as a nation and follow the values of our immigration history and begin to make it possible for them to come out of the shadows and to have a future that gives them a full chance of citizenship.
0.0	0.300869475048	The Cold War is over.
0.0	0.300948038102	That's who I'm indebted to.
0.0	0.301099387848	I think we ought to give Ukraine offensive weapons and I think we ought to fight them on the economic basis because Putin is a one- horse country: oil and energy.
0.0	0.301100318586	I think the United States military is operating under rules of engagement that are too strict...
0.0	0.301426240225	See, I think there is an opportunity to bring the world together.
0.0	0.302199090121	And I apologize to nobody for that.
0.0	0.302577405415	Megyn, that's the problem.
0.0	0.302628778636	Well, but you changed the -- in the book...
0.0	0.302671274229	Thank you, John.
0.0	0.3029567592	She did it for convenience.
0.0	0.303077199203	And it was not only a great accomplishment of the Democratic Party, but of President Obama.
0.0	0.303112465899	We have so much natural gas now, and we can liquify it, and we can transfer it across the sea so we can make Europe dependent on us instead of Putin -- put him back in his little box where he belongs.
0.0	0.303173535791	We can re-assume our role in the world.
0.0	0.303185912447	And there is no nation on the planet better able to adapt to this change than our nation.
0.0	0.303313144611	Yeah (ph), no, I think that's a -- that's a huge mistake, to be closing down mosques.
0.0	0.303386268785	The American people are terrified.
0.0	0.303750973072	We know about the French.
0.0	0.303777657918	You take a look at the -- at Belgium.
0.0	0.303830432162	That's what we believe in.
0.0	0.304072476561	John, I don't think that there is a crisis at the state or local level that really you can point to and say, therefore, I am prepared for the sort of crises that any man or woman who is commander in chief of our country has to deal with.
0.0	0.304089847281	That is why Hillary Clinton cannot win this election.
0.0	0.304213645962	There are many crises that come -- a water crisis in Toledo.
0.0	0.304647596904	And that someone in that office has to do their job.
0.0	0.304736799758	We have to come together as a country.
0.0	0.305088430806	And I agree with much of what the Secretary and the Governor have said.
0.0	0.305312069164	Who has the experience, who has the knowledge, who has the judgement, who has the clarity, and vision and strength of resolve to keep this country safe.
0.0	0.305388059263	They don't believe in any of that.
0.0	0.305629289516	But bottom line now, is in America, in the year 2015, any person who has the ability and the desire should be able to get an education, college education, regardless of the income of his or her family.
0.0	0.305719478213	I did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild.
0.0	0.305783226131	Might I respond?
0.0	0.306013394166	Please think of our founding fathers as you listen.
0.0	0.306321568478	Donald Trump, for example -- I'm glad -- I mentioned his name again just if anybody was missing him...
0.0	0.306359426361	Just because this is not an esoteric argument.
0.0	0.306432329547	We need different solutions to solve the problems and to save our nation.
0.0	0.306756572008	Senator Cruz, I'd like to respond...
0.0	0.30696057909	And then he cut and run because it wasn't popular amongst conservatives, I guess.
1.0	0.307379185299	They knew that they were talking about trying to take our country and attack it.
0.0	0.307410844223	I couldn't talk to anybody about it.
0.0	0.307796935482	And I -- I supported him because I think people, when you're elected, you need to do things.
0.0	0.307922663142	I think it's important for people in elected office to try to forge consensus to solve problems.
0.0	0.308540103867	They need to be defeated militarily, and that will take overwhelming U.S. force.
0.0	0.308696090159	We're worried the future of our children and we've have been burned over and over again.
0.0	0.309103122384	There has to be real tax reform, and the wealthiest and large corporations will pay when I'm president.
0.0	0.309151886652	Well, Megyn, let me say at the outset to the men and women of Iowa, thank you for the incredible hospitality over this past year.
0.0	0.309597915494	The caliphate of ISIS has to be destroyed, which means we need to arm directly to Kurds, imbed our troops with the Iraqi military, re engage with the Sunni tribal leaders.
0.0	0.309723910628	Now I want to go back something.
0.0	0.310182881042	Where were we attacked?
0.0	0.310256943921	We must keep America safe from this threat.
1.0	0.310352292281	I have not insulted Donald personally and I don't intend to.
0.0	0.310484661834	I don't think we're at war with Islam.
0.0	0.310785167231	I -- I believe that we should make community college free.
0.0	0.310806542626	KELLY: Go ahead, Governor Christie.
0.0	0.310828055229	And I think that's a bad idea for the following reason.
0.0	0.311267278508	Those are the kinds of things that we ought to be doing.
0.0	0.311770599278	We need to be much more far thinking in this new 21st century era of -- of nation state failures and conflict.
0.0	0.31178011176	Now, what the magic number is, I don't know, because we don't know the extent of the problem.
0.0	0.311807773341	Look, I am in the establishment because my dad, the greatest man alive was president of the United States and my brother, who I adore as well as fantastic brother was president.
0.0	0.312182163948	Look at what's happening with the Republicans.
0.0	0.312366531095	But I do take what Alan Krueger said seriously.
0.0	0.312399331399	That's why I've got such a good plan.
0.0	0.312643653705	I just don't think it would get the job done.
0.0	0.312866381086	Let me get a chance to respond.
0.0	0.312920331314	He can't have it both ways.
0.0	0.312948851116	I do agree that in particular, Turkey and the Gulf nations have got to make up their minds.
0.0	0.313309400177	It's not for them to make those decisions about whether or not something is legal or illegal, or profiling or not.
0.0	0.313327200928	Because we don't want them in and out -- we don't want them in and out of the prisons.
0.0	0.313434447974	I am glad Donald is running.
0.0	0.313952219144	I honored my commitments, and as president, I will honor every commitment that I make to the men and women of this country.
0.0	0.313960451205	We've been struggling to get this done since Harry Truman.
0.0	0.31487639141	And Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being the commander-in-chief of the United States.
0.0	0.315224154698	And so I think really that vote is going to stay in the Paul household.
0.0	0.316359107946	A bipartisan approach got close.
0.0	0.316731644221	So, yes, I did know people.
0.0	0.317253451658	That's a part of the problem and I am going right at them.
0.0	0.317319101787	And that's why Monday night, what will happen here in Iowa is so important.
0.0	0.31733834247	She's an American citizen.
0.0	0.318372619293	Fine, I'll take it.
0.0	0.318490973594	A debate actually is a policy issue, but I will say this.
0.0	0.318653648857	But the other thing I just wanted quickly to say is, I think President Obama deserves more credit than he gets for what he got done in Washington, despite the Republican obstructionists.
0.0	0.319605291011	... first of all, I'm -- don't worry, I'm not leaving the stage no matter what you ask me.
0.0	0.319742351866	We need to move aggressively now.
0.0	0.319857335073	... there was a question about foreign policy, by the way, and experience.
0.0	0.319951899671	I think more of it is coming and it's going to grow.
0.0	0.319982079027	You know, you claim it is tough talk to discuss carpet bombing.
0.0	0.320009249432	And if we do those things, we can be a country that actually can afford debt-free college again.
0.0	0.320089377256	The problem is...
0.0	0.320211954299	We need to be doing military exercises if not only Estonia but Latvia and Lithuania.
0.0	0.320723072997	You've got to be able to bring together conservatives and evangelicals and libertarians, and stitch together a winning majority.
0.0	0.320739263775	Everybody ought to have a chance to be able to rise to their God-given purpose.
0.0	0.321210827777	And if you listen to what they say -- and I had a chance over those 11 hours to watch and listen, as well as what I see in their debates -- they are putting forth alarming plans.
0.0	0.321213278179	... and I encourage everybody watching this tonight to please, acknowledge that by going online at martinomalley.com and help me wage this campaign for real American capitalism.
0.0	0.321230027471	We have a lot of work to do, to better prepare our nation and to better lead this world into this new century.
0.0	0.321791843143	I'm very much against the government being involved in every aspect of our lives, you know?
0.0	0.321813493321	I think it ought to be a compact -- families contribute, kids contribute.
0.0	0.321903723819	So for me, it is looking at what works and what we need to do to try to move past what happened in '08.
0.0	0.32214903069	They are going to have to take on ISIS.
0.0	0.322414749129	It's saved a lot of lives along the way, Senator.
0.0	0.323108296171	I mean, that's a fact.
0.0	0.323722189254	We're giving young people and working people hope that real change can take place in America.
0.0	0.323901592357	I plead that it's very difficult when you deal with ISIS and organizations like that whose behavior is so barbaric and so vicious that it doesn't seem to have any purpose other than lust for killing and power and that's very difficult to put ourselves in the other shoe.
0.0	0.323932703266	They would -- they would accept the responsibilities of full U.S. citizenship.
0.0	0.324050292832	They serve in the military.
0.0	0.324234160682	So actually, the opportunity is there, because of the threat to all of these countries, to bring all of us together...
0.0	0.324263037424	And so if there's someone in that organization, and it turns out there was, who was willing to be able to do that, that's what we should do.
0.0	0.324516907941	You should stick with it and that's exactly what happened.
0.0	0.324761266478	But when you didn't do that and you ask people to support, you shouldn't cut and run.
0.0	0.32477151834	Look what they did in San Bernardino.
0.0	0.324965015858	I don't think she's responsible for his behavior.
0.0	0.325319064472	If I'm our nominee, I will unite this party and we'll defeat Hillary Clinton and we will turn this country around once and for all, after seven years of the disaster that is Barack Obama.
0.0	0.325852124735	We have got to come forward with a consensus that in fact will work.
0.0	0.325984530139	If you stack that up it would be a three-story building.
0.0	0.326053214154	The radical Islamic jihadists, what they want to do is impose their faith upon each and every one of us -- every one of us.
0.0	0.326168225643	And let me tell you what the answer better not be.
0.0	0.326899595941	And I will go back and say again, AIG was not a big bank.
0.0	0.326947616319	Well, let me just say something.
0.0	0.326982810179	Syria is a mess.
0.0	0.327273271483	Not solely ours, but we must work collaboratively with other nations.
0.0	0.32748305386	I want immigration reform to pass.
0.0	0.327708635354	She is not qualified to be President of the United States.
0.0	0.328088614292	The fact is what we need is someone on that stage who has been tested, who has been through it, who has made decisions, who has sit (ph) in the chair of consequence and can prosecute the case against Hillary Clinton on...
0.0	0.328868987441	And, yes, we are at war with those people.
0.0	0.329107848785	That's basically bordering on a miracle because of our great prison director.
0.0	0.329135694136	And we have to have an attitude when we're in government of serving-hood.
0.0	0.329285779186	They're not wrong.
0.0	0.329597129072	See, I was there when Reagan rebuilt the military.
0.0	0.329612174196	We can have debt-free college in the United States.
0.0	0.329986490691	So I don't think you can paint with a broad brush.
0.0	0.330136016971	I was sick and tired of Hillary Clinton's e-mail.
0.0	0.330141987605	And I think that's the false choice...
0.0	0.330202313084	I am still sick and tired of Hillary Clinton's e-mails.
0.0	0.33057212569	I -- I think -- I think as Democrats we ought to proudly support the Affordable Care Act, improve it, and make it the model that we know it can be.
0.0	0.330589953813	No, you weren't.
0.0	0.331734101352	You know, Ted didn't show up.
0.0	0.331743447935	So let's focus on what this election is really going to be about.
0.0	0.331936520213	You can't be in favor of defend us...
0.0	0.332323227922	It is about understanding the secondary and third consequences that fall next.
0.0	0.332470084085	And I would hope in the midst of all of this discussion, this country makes certain that we do not turn our backs on the men and women who put their lives on the line to defend us, and that we stand with them as they have stood with us.
0.0	0.332632671858	It is because in this nation, we are influenced by Judeo-Christian values that teach us to care for the less fortunate, to reach out to the needy, to love our neighbor.
0.0	0.332673487163	And what I hear is people's concern that the economy we have is a rigged economy.
0.0	0.33275062704	Obviously, I believe that on a college campus, there should be enough respect so people hear each other.
0.0	0.33414853131	In terms of Wall Street, I respectfully disagree with you, madam secretary, in the sense that the issue here is when you have such incredible power and such incredible wealth.
0.0	0.33418492261	Well, I think that there are different records.
0.0	0.334412017577	There is no question in my mind that if we summon our resources, both our leadership resources and all of the tools at our disposal, not just military force, which should be used as a last resort, but our diplomacy, our development aid, law enforcement, sharing of intelligence in a much more open and cooperative way -- that we can bring people together.
0.0	0.334612872464	All of us believe climate change is real.
0.0	0.334955033629	Millions of people are going to have to stand up, turn off the TV, get involved in the political process and tell the big- money interest that we are taking back our country.
0.0	0.33501183353	I don't blame Hillary Clinton at all for this.
0.0	0.335232941397	Kevin, if I could just jump in.
0.0	0.335318236135	Yeah, I would encourage people to go on my website, marcorubio.com, and we'll put all the facts up there so people can see it for themselves.
0.0	0.335397730845	We think we're going to do very well in Iowa with the liberty vote.
0.0	0.335542211447	The problem is, this redistribution has gone in the wrong direction.
0.0	0.335676264231	I will make sure that we fire the sheer incompetence inside the Department of Veterans Affairs and then we'll give veterans a choice card so that they don't have to travel hours and hours to get care if they want to go to their private provider.
0.0	0.336411233978	And we ought to fight them on that level.
0.0	0.336745609828	It will not happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.337471603024	And this is where I've had my disagreement with Senator Rubio.
0.0	0.337504510262	... We're never going to win elections if we don't have a more broader unifying message.
0.0	0.337902997799	And I -- I thought, if I didn't jump in, I might not be able to tell everybody this.
0.0	0.337978074333	They are doing everything they can to prevent the voices of Americans to be heard.
0.0	0.338519819507	But when millions of people stand up and are prepared to take on the insurance companies and the drug companies, it will happen, and I will lead that effort.
0.0	0.338659964433	...and that do not allow us to pursue victory.
0.0	0.338758747805	I have been tried under many different emergencies and I can tell you that in each of those emergencies, whether they were inflicted by drug gangs, whether they were natural emergencies, I knew how to lead and I knew how to govern because I know how to manage people in a crisis and be very clear about the goal of protecting human life.
0.0	0.339409655241	I'm all about making sure we actually get results for whatever we do.
0.0	0.339715474745	It is enormously complicated.
0.0	0.339847270542	She wants to pursue the American dream.
0.0	0.339858257447	... and that's what you and others can start providing in the Senate.
0.0	0.339996721046	How has it worked?
0.0	0.340332546742	I think what's interesting about where that liberty vote goes that my father brought to the Republican Party is, I don't think they're necessarily going to go for Ted.
0.0	0.340639442248	So, you know, it's fine for you to say what you're going to say, but I looked very carefully at your proposal.
0.0	0.340705407516	And the reason is, is that I've been a reformer all of my career, fighting to reform welfare, fighting to reform the Pentagon, also being in a position to balance the budget, because that is very, very hard to do.
0.0	0.34113436996	I'm running for president, because as I go around this nation, I talk to a lot of people.
0.0	0.341965636273	Anyone can go online at tedcruz.org and read exactly what it said.
0.0	0.342394714218	I think Bernie Sanders is good candidate for president of Sweden.
0.0	0.342503024228	We want to destroy ISIS, it has to be in the air and on the ground.
0.0	0.342525568851	Kathie, let me say this.
0.0	0.342600856724	I think we all support it.
0.0	0.342701715609	I ask for your support on the caucuses come Monday night and I will make you proud as our party's nominee.
0.0	0.342828154217	There will be a process.
0.0	0.342890819738	They elected moderate leaders.
0.0	0.343064356169	... it's harder and harder to actually solve this problem.
0.0	0.343688148764	They blow people up.
0.0	0.343726782866	It's not going to happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.344588252757	May I respond?
0.0	0.344588252757	May I respond?
0.0	0.344600525656	Both.
0.0	0.344600525656	No.
0.0	0.344600525656	No.
0.0	0.344600525656	No.
0.0	0.34461266644	You know, Chris, here's what happened with Medicaid in my state.
0.0	0.344941025901	But all of this has to come together when we have a positive attitude, an optimistic approach, an ability for us to set the tune as conservatives, to invite other people in to be part of that orchestra.
0.0	0.34512596793	That would be a disaster for this country.
0.0	0.345153515106	It's also about choosing our next commander-in-chief.
0.0	0.345502384469	Megyn?
0.0	0.34584037133	If they want to accept our values and our laws.
0.0	0.345950651338	They knew they were talking about the issues of attacking people, Megyn.
0.0	0.34605300658	I think after 11 hours, that's pretty clear, yes.
0.0	0.346265649935	Go ahead.
0.0	0.346422686262	I've always listened to you, Megyn.
0.0	0.346508152883	She put American strategy at risk for her convenience.
0.0	0.346578033541	That's a wonderful business model.
0.0	0.346810779699	All of you in Iowa, I need you to caucus for me.
0.0	0.346854166221	But the first duty of the next president of the United States is to fix the mess at the Department of Veterans Affairs.
0.0	0.34685813305	It's become more complicated.
0.0	0.347099571945	Well, I will gladly confess that I'm the only one on this stage with no political title.
0.0	0.347113288283	Who do you know will stop amnesty and secure the borders?
0.0	0.347181317725	That was a terrible mistake.
0.0	0.347251606205	Make ourselves stronger at home, but also our role in the world, yes, is also to confront evil when it rises.
0.0	0.348395431017	They have children who are doing so well, I've met and worked with dreamers.
0.0	0.348689466404	But the thing that is most important to me and caused me to run for office is I'm worried about the country and how much debt we're adding.
0.0	0.348947143464	But I would want to agree with something that Senator Sanders says.
0.0	0.348986682032	And I would -- first of all, face him down in that whole region, the whole Baltic region.
0.0	0.34961675728	Well, John, let me concur with you and with all Americans who are shocked and disgusted by what we saw in Paris yesterday.
0.0	0.35008185056	And I have to tell you, I would not want -- if I lived in Iowa, Terry Branstad administering my health care.
0.0	0.350236425124	I want to use pell grants to help defray the living expenses that often make a difference, whether a young person can stay in school or not.
0.0	0.350441429636	I'd suggest people take a look at it.
0.0	0.350960227004	So should the UK, so should France.
0.0	0.35110724951	And I will pay for it by, yes, taxing the wealthy more, closing corporate loopholes, deductions, and other kinds of favorable treatment.
0.0	0.351501839671	So it is difficult.
0.0	0.351753355148	But I do think that her position as promoting women's rights and fairness to women in the workplace, that if what Bill Clinton did any CEO in our country did with an intern, with a 22-year- old, 21-year-old intern in their office, they would be fired.
0.0	0.35183897893	Well, let me be clear about one thing, there's only one savior and it's not me.
0.0	0.352089896943	In terms of my faith, look, all I say is that when I study scripture, I know that people who live in the shadows need to have a chance.
0.0	0.352255484325	I guess I'm part of the establishment Barbara Bush is my mom.
0.0	0.352606768289	That's what I understand is the request from the international...
0.0	0.352938847692	Because you realize that people depending on you.
1.0	0.353037286056	She wants to put Barack Obama on the Supreme Court of the United States of America.
0.0	0.353523930394	And that's not what's happening now.
0.0	0.353669507104	You cannot destroy ISIS with a military that's being diminished.
0.0	0.353994946554	And it's not just a question for parents and grandparents to answer.
0.0	0.354096689611	I'm an eye surgeon from Bowling Green, Kentucky, I miss doing eye surgery, still get to do a little bit.
0.0	0.354212161448	I disagree with free college for everybody.
0.0	0.354436273593	That is what we have to do.
0.0	0.355123061015	And those countries who are opposed to Islam, they are going to have to get deeply involved in a way that is not the case today.
0.0	0.355354718727	But I think it's important to understand there's a significant difference that I have with Senator Sanders about how best to provide quality, affordable health care for everyone.
0.0	0.355736924921	Please go to hillaryclinton.com and be part of making this country what we know it can and should be.
0.0	0.356190806686	Number one, if they violate it, we need to move against them.
0.0	0.356297341819	We will finish the 700 miles of fencing and walls our nation needs.
0.0	0.356398761032	Chris, let's begin by being clear what this campaign is about.
0.0	0.356875491676	What I've always said is that this issue does need to be solved.
0.0	0.356907652106	... do I go -- let me go first, and then you can please recognize Rand after.
0.0	0.35740179539	The issue now is do we break them ?up do we reestablish Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.357546472515	Gosh, if you guys ask one more mean question I may have to leave the stage.
1.0	0.357601498375	And the overall message is that it doesn't result in job loss.
0.0	0.357733973394	And if we capture any of these ISIS killers alive, they are going to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we're going to find out everything they know, because when I'm president, unlike Barack Obama, we will keep this country safe.
0.0	0.357840245963	And when he moved on his own people, threatening a massacre, genocide, the Europeans and the Arabs, our allies and partners, did ask for American help and we provided it.
0.0	0.35842809875	And Megyn, it's best not to talk anymore about back doors and encryption, it will get solved, but it needs to be solved in the situation of the White House with the technology folks.
0.0	0.35850797611	You learn to create a security cabinet.
0.0	0.35855204263	Radical Muslims and radical Islam is not just hate talk.
0.0	0.358636444307	And the reason why this war against them is so important is that very basis of religious liberty.
0.0	0.358863230763	Well, Bret, first that's not entirely the story.
0.0	0.35894265321	But the truth of the matter is, if we want wages to go up, we've got to get 11 million of our neighbors out of off the book shadow economy, and into the full light of an American economy.
0.0	0.359166645217	And a rebuilt U.S. military is going to destroy these terrorists.
0.0	0.359213223585	I believe we've got to go further.
0.0	0.359330868592	No, I have not.
0.0	0.3596247212	And, they've insinuated themselves into everything.
0.0	0.360128361877	Let's go to the major issues facing America.
0.0	0.360261741392	With all -- with all due respect...
0.0	0.360324239378	I think it's a big thing that our party needs to be part of, and I've been a leader in Congress on trying to bring about criminal justice reform.
0.0	0.36034229928	We should be developing oil, and gas, and coal, and nuclear, and wind, and solar, and ethanol, and biofuels.
0.0	0.360582739143	Well first of all, I think it's important that when we're running for the highest office in the land that we recognize that we're living in dangerous times and we have to be serious about it, that our words have consequences.
0.0	0.360616527858	I am certainly, absolutely, willing to look at that bill again and make sure there's a stronger bill.
0.0	0.361303583002	They want everyone in this country to follow their religious beliefs the way they do.
0.0	0.361913734564	I also think the war on drugs has disproportionately affected our African-American community, and what we need to do is make sure that the war on drugs is equal protection under the law and that we don't unfairly incarcerate another generation of young African-American males.
0.0	0.362028230146	That's why as commander in chief, I will take on ISIS, not only because it keeps us safe, but because it allows us to absolutely conduct our religious affairs the way we find in our heart and in our souls.
0.0	0.362466554317	I don't think any -- I don't think any sensible person would disagree that the invasion of Iraq led to the massive level of instability we are seeing right now.
0.0	0.362579717952	I have made the decisions that need to be made as a governor to protect us and as president of the United States, no one will keep this country safer than I will.
0.0	0.362708096256	And I had commitments to be at a town hall in New Hampshire.
0.0	0.362855255811	And, also, acting according to our principles and constructing a new foreign policy of engagement and collaboration, and doing a much better job of identifying threats before they back up into military corners.
0.0	0.362946852361	My heart, like all of us in this room, John, and all the people across our country, my hearts go out to the people of France in this moment of loss.
0.0	0.363091415808	What we need to do is lead an international coalition which includes very significantly the Muslim nations in that region who are going to have to fight and defend their way of life.
0.0	0.36309264946	Well, Mr. Cooney, we've actually been focusing on border security to the exclusion of talking about comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.363099023777	DICKERSON: A question from Kathie Obradovich.
0.0	0.363258558374	You read about all the companies now that are doing business -- about to do business in Iran, and if we don't get this settled now, with other countries in the world, about sanctions, then Iran could violate that agreement, and we're the only ones putting the sanctions on.
0.0	0.363315640907	It was our money, and we brought them back to tend to the mentally ill. Because I don't think they ought to live in prison or live under a bridge; to treat the drug-addicted so they're not in an in-and-out-of- the-door policy out of the prisons; and to help the working poor so they don't live in emergency rooms.
0.0	0.363702365875	Now, once that is done, everyone agrees we need healthcare reform.
0.0	0.363729544339	John, I would disagree with Secretary Clinton respectfully on this score.
0.0	0.363928006872	But this election is not about our pedigree, this is an election about people that are really hurting.
0.0	0.363991499552	But it's a falseness, and that's an authenticity problem -- that everybody he knows is not as perfect as him because we're all for amnesty.
1.0	0.364467551967	The 500,000 who came home with PTSD, and traumatic brain injury.
0.0	0.365521177972	She should not feel uncomfortable about her citizenship.
0.0	0.365547806297	So, I think we've got to understand the complexity of the world that we are facing and no place is more so than in the Middle East.
0.0	0.365579978037	We must able to work collaboratively with others.
0.0	0.366041582915	If you believe that our country's problems and the threats that we face in this world can only be met with new thinking, new and fresh approaches, then I ask you to join my campaign.
0.0	0.366586078425	The fact of the matter is, the more our people earn, the more money they spend, and the more our whole economy grows.
0.0	0.366737890868	And I give Senator Sanders a lot of credit for really lighting a fire under many people -- young, old, everybody -- who sees a chance to be involved and have their voice heard.
0.0	0.367189390634	Look, we don't know what's going to happen in ten months.
0.0	0.367245003684	And I wanted to add one other thing, John, and I think it's important for all of us on this stage.
0.0	0.367248269749	And also -- also, what we should be clear about is we end up spending -- and I think the secretary knows this -- far more per capita on health care than any other major country, and our outcomes, health care outcomes are not necessarily that good.
0.0	0.367311392071	I respectfully disagree with Senator Sander's approach.
0.0	0.367358229147	That can be done without profiling people.
0.0	0.367619018518	It cannot be contained, it must be defeated.
0.0	0.367658579953	Making fun of disabled people...
0.0	0.367708998324	Here is the major issue when we talk about Wall Street.
0.0	0.368203236868	I believe capital gains, for the most part, should be taxed the same way we tax income from hard work, sweat, and toil.
1.0	0.368461905036	I have voted time and again to -- for -- for the background check, and I want to see it improved and expanded.
0.0	0.368483750105	We don't want to be like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.368632173427	(LAUGHTER) Now that we've gotten the Donald Trump portion out of the way...
0.0	0.369846184985	Well, thank you very much to CBS and everyone here this evening for giving us another chance to appear before you.
0.0	0.370143142262	You've heard some of those tonight.
0.0	0.370412107326	I will break up these banks.
0.0	0.371034707423	When that battle was waged, my friend Senator Rubio chose to stand with Barack Obama and Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer and support amnesty.
0.0	0.371302024296	and in 2007 it almost passed when my brother was president of the United States.
0.0	0.372048484895	I think THAT you can talk about Islamists who clearly are also jihadists, but I think it's not particularly helpful to make the case that Senator Sanders was just making that I agree with, that we've got to reach out to Muslim countries.
0.0	0.372382637773	He cut and run.
0.0	0.372615732288	Number one, we're going to keep ISIS out of America.
0.0	0.372856846178	You want to know what carpet bombing is?
0.0	0.373044013945	That is why they're building an -- right now, developing long- range missiles capable of reaching the United States, and that is why there's going -- they're going to use those $100 billion to expand their conventional capabilities and to one day buy or build a nuclear weapon.
0.0	0.373209356481	And I'll tell you who supported my amendment -- Jeff Sessions, the strongest opponent of amnesty in the United States Congress.
0.0	0.373342126234	She did.
0.0	0.373717330533	It is a different, fundamental military strategy than what we've seen from Barack Obama.
0.0	0.374084978326	And Dulce Candy -- a pretty cool name, actually -- that is now an entrepreneur over Youtube is part of that American spirit, and we should celebrate it as conservatives.
0.0	0.374246428503	I think he was probably the most honest man in politics that we've ever seen in a generation.
0.0	0.374938292133	We always had such a loving relationship in these debates and in between and the tweets.
0.0	0.37496000365	If I'm elected president, we will repeal every word of Obamacare.
0.0	0.375002361444	They are not going to go away on their own.
0.0	0.375007121228	I would certainly tackle the cost issues, because I think that once the foundation was laid with a system to try to get as many people as possible into it, to end insurance discrimination against people with preexisting conditions or women, for example, that, yes, we were going to have to figure out how to get more competition in the insurance market, how to get the costs of -- particularly, prescription drugs, but other out-of-pocket expenses down.
0.0	0.376089807481	And so -- and I've always made that clear about that cover story.
0.0	0.376117831802	That's what it is.
0.0	0.377005220166	We need to focus our energies there, not these broad, blanket, kind of statements that will make it harder for us to deal with ISIS.
0.0	0.377342138028	I didn't know I had so much power.
0.0	0.37754728422	I would like to see it updated.
0.0	0.378019267758	You learn that threats always change.
0.0	0.378658987783	And especially what these programs are asking us to pass that will do nothing to help the environment, but will be devastating for our economy.
0.0	0.379213767464	I have nothing against the passion that my two friends here have about reinstating Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.379236741612	This is a war for the soul of Islam.
0.0	0.380050042343	But what's wrong is your premise in the question.
0.0	0.380114328322	I have a comprehensive, tough plan.
0.0	0.380366865528	Chris I was mentioned in that question.
0.0	0.381550304005	And if our middle class makes more money, they spend more money, and our whole economy grows.
0.0	0.381599850233	That's not capitalism, Secretary Clinton.
0.0	0.381616574481	No, because if you look at the quote, and it's very specific.
0.0	0.381869315637	She put America's secrets at risk for her convenience.
0.0	0.382646155127	Your question was you have disagreed...
0.0	0.382746634723	Well, I've got news for you, we can.
0.0	0.383081607956	And as it relates to all the other organizations, let me give you a good example.
0.0	0.383178765378	The American people have been told for 30 years they're going to enforce the border, they're going to build a wall and it never gets built and it never happens.
0.0	0.383504501002	This election is not only about electing a president.
0.0	0.38352960871	That's American citizenship.
0.0	0.383648110848	Let's don't use the term 'boots on the ground'.
0.0	0.383871189476	It ain't complicated.
0.0	0.383880188077	If it had gone right, believe me, she would have been running around to be able to take credit for it.
0.0	0.384403358358	Now what we have to take on is the pharmaceutical industry that is ripping off the American people every single day.
0.0	0.38440688552	Or a young woman who had been performing at President Obama's second inauguration coming home, absolutely stellar young woman, hanging out with her friends in a park getting shot by a gang member.
0.0	0.384750849882	It's not a bestseller.
0.0	0.384760854296	And we have -- and let me make this promise.
0.0	0.384859497617	And my reading of the law and the Constitution convinces me that the President has the authority that he is attempting to exercise with respect to dreamers and their parents, because I think all of us on this stage agree that we need comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.385622836223	If you're living on the edge of poverty and you get a $100 fine or your car towed, a lot of times you lose your job.
0.0	0.38567599252	So, your original question is the right question.
0.0	0.386089964336	Hillary Clinton this week said Barack Obama would make a great Supreme Court justice.
0.0	0.386122228162	I do not believe that we have to destroy our economy in order to protect our environment.
0.0	0.386635377646	Sure, because there has been three different investigations and proven that I knew nothing.
0.0	0.386668980854	I have -- look, I would agree with much of what Senator Sanders says, Kevin.
0.0	0.386729446412	To get the information from Hillary Clinton, you need to get a subpoena from the FBI.
0.0	0.386940297946	Barack Obama wants America to be more like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.386990297799	So did you.
0.0	0.38715876188	I've gotten to do some incredible things.
0.0	0.387261997697	Well, this is what I would say, and the Congressman was right.
0.0	0.387362131835	There's never going do be perfect bill.
0.0	0.387887763985	You want one?
0.0	0.38798816594	My son is not a pair of boots on the ground.
0.0	0.388027486894	they expect to get something.
0.0	0.388060630714	And we should be a welcoming nation.
0.0	0.388236573059	If I am elected president, keep an eye on the tarmac, because I'll be back, because Iowa in 2017 will not be fly-over country.
0.0	0.388244798331	As president, I will support law enforcement and we'll stop radical terrorist attacks in this country by supporting our intelligence community and law enforcement community.
0.0	0.388586004335	That's how I focused from the beginning of the campaign and it is how I intend to continue going forward.
0.0	0.389427246592	That's the kind of leadership this country needs.
0.0	0.389439238015	We cannot let things get farther down the road, like we did with North Korea.
0.0	0.38986799167	And I can do it without raising the debt, without raising taxes on the middle class and making it reasonably manageable within our budget so that we can be fiscally responsible at the same time.
0.0	0.389916382693	I want to thank the people of Iowa for being so welcoming to me.
0.0	0.390035094239	But I want to say a quick word about what Senator Sanders and then Governor O'Malley said.
0.0	0.390212976644	I really put that on Assad and on the Iraqis and on the region itself.
0.0	0.390632848969	But you've just asked a very fundamental question about the role of faith in our country.
0.0	0.390679422818	It is not a radical idea to say that a single mom should be earning enough money to take care of her kids.
0.0	0.390721834197	It was against Assad.
0.0	0.390999266465	There was nobody to talk to and it really did give me an insight into the very difficult problems presidents face.
0.0	0.391675955884	That's crony capitalism.
0.0	0.391752346577	I am the son and grandson of immigrants.
0.0	0.391873567256	Absolutely.
0.0	0.391873567256	Absolutely.
0.0	0.392294619683	Because if your faith causes you to care for the less fortunate, it is something you want to see in your public figures.
0.0	0.392926613348	I think it's important we put this in historic context.
0.0	0.393227997155	I said we should go to 65, but only if we have as careful a screening and vetting process as we can imagine, whatever resources it takes because I do not want us to, in any way, inadvertently allow people who wish us harm to come into our country.
0.0	0.394954831623	It should follow the principles of expanding competition, empowering patients, and keeping government from getting in between us and our doctors.
0.0	0.395482070722	It is not a radical idea to say that if somebody works 40 hours a week, that person should not be living in poverty.
0.0	0.395534077283	I don't think taxpayers should be paying to send Donald Trump's kids to college.
0.0	0.395625638337	They knew that.
0.0	0.395922600501	What is important to understand is we have organizations, whether it is ISIS or Al Qaida, who do believe we should go back several thousand years.
0.0	0.396086428338	Let me just add to that.
0.0	0.396225058979	And ISIS, make no mistake about it, is an evil in this world.
0.0	0.396996300435	He believes everything he stands for.
0.0	0.397120677975	ISIS has now attacked a western democracy in -- in France.
0.0	0.398076724975	When I ran in Texas, I told the people of Texas, "if you elect me, I will lead the fight against amnesty."
0.0	0.398390136589	That's not true.
0.0	0.399269383036	Like we have a -- we have a lot of work to do and we're the only nation on the planet that buries as many of our people from gun violence as we do.
0.0	0.399310221429	And that's the only way we'll ever balance our budget.
0.0	0.399623967422	If Teddy Roosevelt, a good Republican, were alive today, you know what he'd say?
0.0	0.400301690379	We have to go after price gouging and monopolistic practices and get Medicare the authority to negotiate.
0.0	0.40031630751	But after I said that, we're not hearing so much about Hillary Clinton's e-mails.
0.0	0.400711373516	They like to ask direct questions.
0.0	0.401111166315	I want to ask the people of the audience.
0.0	0.401282063499	So I've said, if the big banks don't play by the rules, I will break them up.
0.0	0.401599220972	There was a lot of activism on campus -- Civil Rights activism, antiwar activism, women's rights activism -- and I do appreciate the way young people are standing up and speaking out.
0.0	0.40175116674	Come on now.
0.0	0.402082367171	This issue touches on two broad issues.
0.0	0.402187237437	That was good for New York.
0.0	0.402212284609	And I was there when we went into the Gulf War.
0.0	0.402320149526	That is abundantly clear.
0.0	0.402347737743	The central question in this race is trust.
1.0	0.402544188122	You know, the amendment you're talking about is one sentence -- it's 38 words.
0.0	0.402825904698	And, I'll note finally, Chris, there is a reason that Iowa's Congressman Steve King, perhaps the fiercest defender of farmers in this state, is sharing my campaign.
0.0	0.40320221676	That's what our parents and grandparents always did.
1.0	0.403888080374	Unfortunately, Nouri al-Maliki, the prime minister, set about decimating it.
0.0	0.40397189781	And so, you go the extra mile.
0.0	0.404009234939	That's get rid of Planned Parenthood funding from the United States of America.
0.0	0.404228612208	Starting with our children and moving forward.
0.0	0.404307970086	Exactly what to do as it relates to ISIS.
0.0	0.404366540281	Terrorism in this country scares everyone.
0.0	0.404455726852	You will have welcomed Heidi and our girls, Caroline and Catherine, into your homes.
0.0	0.404465746255	If we are not successful, if we continue the same old, same old of Washington being run by corporate lobbyists and big-money interests, nothing changes.
0.0	0.404801986628	So was I, John.
0.0	0.404811270161	That is what the Democrats in the Senate have put forward as a proposal.
0.0	0.404877286666	... everybody nervous to get out of their cars if you're a law enforcement officer.
0.0	0.404978003708	It certainly does cover it.
0.0	0.405104158715	I think, you know, Rand and I have some significant issues on policy, but I respect Rand.
0.0	0.406351474128	I want to see us do away with the gun show loophole.
0.0	0.406829212559	It will give hope to millions of young people.
0.0	0.40691309798	And it has been amazing to me.
0.0	0.407067897096	Get the lawyers off the damn backs of the military once and for all.
0.0	0.407177964756	But those Muslim countries are going to have to lead the effort.
0.0	0.407414236492	We must anticipate these threats before they happen.
0.0	0.40744283572	And I was clear about that at the time.
0.0	0.407588300186	You can't do that without the cooperation of the Muslim world because they're as threatened as we are.
0.0	0.407995026111	This is a new era of conflict where traditional ways of huge standing armies are not as -- serve our purposes as well as special ops, better intelligence and being more proactive.
0.0	0.408883702198	One of the problems we have had -- I think all Americans understand this, is whether it's Republican administrations or Democratic administrations, we have seen Wall Street and Goldman Sachs dominate administrations.
0.0	0.409329381762	We can end sanctuary cities by cutting off...
0.0	0.409432752576	In fact, sometimes it's not that way...
0.0	0.409566800751	And the thing is, she can't be a champion of women's rights at the same time she's got this that is always lurking out there, this type of behavior.
0.0	0.410104239844	We should be supportive of that effort.
0.0	0.410533374802	You can't hide behind parliamentary tricks.
0.0	0.410983131	She's the senator from New York.
0.0	0.41101265142	We were proud of them on graduation day, but we're going to be proud every month for the rest of our natural lives.
0.0	0.411350574777	The United States has, unfortunately, been victimized by terrorism going back decades.
0.0	0.412319257417	But Secretary Clinton, you've been on three sides of this.
0.0	0.412343531376	You know, no public policy doesn't have, in some cases, negative consequences.
0.0	0.412354858258	Well, I'm sorry that whoever tweeted that had that impression because I worked closely with New Yorkers after 9/11 for my entire first term to rebuild.
0.0	0.412578262924	The time has come to stop ignoring the mentally ill in this country and begin to treat them and get them on their feet, along with, of course, with treating the drug-addicted.
0.0	0.412990250644	... against Islam -- radical Islam -- if you're not for border security.
0.0	0.413296997536	And Hillary Clinton lied to the families of those four brave Americans who lost their life in Benghazi.
0.0	0.41421549547	That is what this debate is all about, and I would suggest let's stay focused on those issues -- rather than just attacks directed at each other.
0.0	0.414318598485	And to contrast, even -- there are differences among us.
0.0	0.414358320056	Because he understands that I'm committed to a fair, and level playing field for every energy source without lobbyists, and without Washington picking winners and losers.
0.0	0.414440332652	Yes, I do believe there must be a tax on Wall Street speculation.
0.0	0.414592249546	By the way, no nation on earth is more generous than America is.
0.0	0.414726773964	And I am the one true fiscal conservative who will look at all spending.
0.0	0.414746854658	And what we said is, if they're going to impose this on us, we better prepare to protect the state from it.
0.0	0.415000783926	They should have made it more open ended for the next president.
0.0	0.415480156053	But at the end of the day, Wall Street today has enormous economic and political power.
0.0	0.415579701054	People have invested a lot of energy into that.
0.0	0.415638723246	But I just have to tell you that it's best with some of these things not be said.
0.0	0.415670111537	And my effort in introducing them was to find a solution that reflected common ground and that fixed the problem.
0.0	0.415790582203	But if you place good ones, you pocket it.
0.0	0.415972703085	We never dreamt we'd ever see it."
0.0	0.416240714412	Once again, I am running a campaign differently than any other candidate.
0.0	0.416285076941	That's the record of accomplishment that should be taken to Hillary Clinton, who has no record of accomplishment.
0.0	0.416953387783	Bret, let me tell you, this is another one of those places where Hillary Clinton has so much to answer for, and why she is completely unqualified to be commander in chief.
0.0	0.417176103136	Well, let's take it one at a time.
0.0	0.417389280888	It was good for the economy and it was a way to rebuke the terrorists who had attacked our country.
0.0	0.417495773128	We just heard an argument back and forth that we can't solve immigration.
0.0	0.417711084227	So if Ms. Davis wanted to step aside and get rid of her ability to be able to do that, there should be someone else in that office who it didn't violate their conscience so they could follow the law of the state of Kentucky.
0.0	0.418230113275	Let me tell you something, when you see thousands upon thousands upon thousands of children being murdered in the womb, I can't think of anything better than that.
0.0	0.418630399205	But when we came to Washington, we made a different choice.
0.0	0.418748767825	I don't know and with all due respect to the secretary, Wall Street played by the rules?
0.0	0.419705608804	And number three, we should work to de-link health insurance from employment so if you lose your job, your health insurance goes with you and it is personal, portable and affordable.
0.0	0.420621290187	Well, first of all, it isn't the middle class.
0.0	0.421085939861	Hillary Clinton has never been responsible for those kind of decisions where they were held accountable.
0.0	0.421221625465	And together we make it possible for a new generation of young people to refinance their debt and not come out with debt in the future.
0.0	0.421285786284	Your name wasn't mentioned, Ted.
0.0	0.421917232691	I said, "how's it going?"
0.0	0.421998419446	I've had a lot of folks give me donations from all kinds of backgrounds say, I don't agree with you on everything, but I like what you do.
0.0	0.422182033047	So, yes, this has developed.
0.0	0.422519430286	And anyone who lies to the families of Americans who have died in the service of this country can never be commander-in-chief of the United States.
0.0	0.423176712604	But let me have one area of disagreement with the Secretary.
0.0	0.423517931067	Their business model is greed and fraud.
0.0	0.423550654925	We have made some good progress.
0.0	0.423851908779	And, there is no one on this stage better prepared to prosecute the case against Hillary Clinton than I am.
0.0	0.424209233223	You know, it is difficult finding intelligence that is actionable in a lot of these places, but we have to keep trying.
0.0	0.424368635982	That's what we need to to, and I laid that out prior to the crisis with the advice of a lot of people, including 12 Medal of Honor recipients that I'm proud that they're supporting my campaign.
0.0	0.424445825849	In Ferguson, for every 100 African-American women, there are only 60 African-American men.
0.0	0.425042125387	The threat is Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.425596269006	They've been stepped on for too long in this society, and we are beginning to treat them.
0.0	0.425860858554	We can create a situation where wages begin to rise.
0.0	0.426288358419	We have problems with Russia.
0.0	0.426643056273	We can slap on sanctions alone, on day one, but it's not gonna be anywhere near as effective.
0.0	0.426828367004	From top to bottom.
0.0	0.42761519215	You've got to go the extra mile.
0.0	0.427637446477	Close the gun show loophole, close the online loophole and...
0.0	0.427756928322	Our country is in crisis.
0.0	0.427800850739	It has not been in effect during the administration of Barack Obama.
0.0	0.427931708663	Why do -- why, over her political career has Wall Street been a major -- the major campaign contributor to Hillary Clinton?
0.0	0.428089522281	Well, our prayers are with the people of France tonight, but that is not enough.
0.0	0.42813069974	Please go to berniesanders.com.
0.0	0.428379601593	And if you want to know who's telling the truth, you should look and ask people like Jeff Sessions and Steve King and Rush Limbaugh and Mark Levin, all of whom say, as Jeff Sessions said, responding to these false attacks just recently in Alabama -- he said, "if it wasn't for Ted Cruz, the Gang of Eight Rubio/Schumer bill would have passed.
0.0	0.428926324831	As a former mayor and a former governor, there was never a single day, John, when I went to bed or woke up without realizing that this could happen in our own country.
0.0	0.428947977785	Again, Americans murdered.
0.0	0.429059514416	It is not a barbed wire fence.
0.0	0.429220075432	I never said that Ms. Davis should either lose her job or that she had to do it.
0.0	0.429285855939	But I did want to -- I wanted to follow up.
0.0	0.429512445925	I've been to Ferguson, I've been trying to look for solutions to our criminal justice problem.
0.0	0.430190264565	You're not going to be able to ram down the throat of the American people your approach.
0.0	0.430375443936	It will be fly-to country.
0.0	0.430535252769	They thought something was wrong.
0.0	0.430759583775	I will take her on, and when I take her on I guarantee you one thing, she will never get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.431111653018	I saw Reagan do it, I've seen other presidents do it.
0.0	0.431163866758	There has never been a jihadist group like this.
0.0	0.431371877331	... ground and air.
0.0	0.432289035317	So we have a lot of work to do to get jobs going again, get incomes rising again.
0.0	0.432390933221	And I'll tell you the endorsements that I am proud of are the over 200,000 volunteers across this country who have signed up to volunteer for our campaign.
0.0	0.432511964599	And I have laid out specific plans -- you can go to my web site, hillaryclinton.com, and read the details.
0.0	0.43286836322	You know, I've never really brought this up unless asked the question, but I have responded to the question.
0.0	0.43324347901	... Actually, I was...
0.0	0.433268516256	This is about the bigger, broader war against ISIS.
0.0	0.433842609152	I'm asking you for your vote.
0.0	0.434387478672	We will see what the American people are willing to support.
0.0	0.435577016828	If the proponents of this bill actually demonstrate a commitment not to politics, not to campaigning all the time, but to actually fixing this problem, to finding a middle ground.
0.0	0.435617807349	I want to build on and improve the Affordable Care Act.
0.0	0.437212732009	And there's all sorts of ways that can be done at the state, local and federal level to do that.
0.0	0.437497017799	You know, it's -- it's a fact that if you can pay for a $79 one-way ticket to Orlando, and you can escape the challenges of a declining economy and high crime rates, you move to Orlando.
0.0	0.437531084423	It's not just about getting rid of a single dictator.
0.0	0.437601468062	... First of all -- Let me go first, and then you can please recognize Rand after.
0.0	0.437980630446	And it requires an entire world to come together, including in a very active way, the Muslim nations.
0.0	0.438339647125	This is a grassroots campaign and, you know, when I ran for senate in Texas, I told the people of Texas that I'm not going there to go along to get along.
0.0	0.43854059719	Why don't we let the process work.
0.0	0.438675868368	I have supported a consensus approach to solving this problem wherever it came up.
0.0	0.439328081616	I think the other problem is we have a legal immigration system that's outdated, it's primarily based on whether you have family members living here.
0.0	0.439591888036	You know, John Adams famously said, "facts are are stubborn things."
0.0	0.439768320782	Well, look the Joint Terrorism Task Force needs resources and tools.
0.0	0.439804073891	But people have to be alert.
0.0	0.439812093454	This is the new sort of challenge, the new sort of threat that does, in fact, require new thinking, fresh approaches and new leadership.
0.0	0.439819346184	I have said the invasion of Iraq was a mistake.
0.0	0.440156663075	The media noise will soon be over and it's now for the men and women of Iowa to decide.
0.0	0.440164755292	The NSA is another big issue.
0.0	0.440429736821	John, there is not a serious economist who would disagree that the six big banks of Wall Street have taken on so much power and that all of us are still on the hook to bail them out on their bad bets.
0.0	0.440847843216	I mean, my dad went to college on a G.I.
0.0	0.441826302988	Well, let me first describe Iran because they're not just a normal nation state.
0.0	0.441830552902	Our role in the world is to make ourselves a beacon of hope.
0.0	0.442609480788	Reinstating Glass- Steagall is a part of what very well could help, but it is nowhere near enough.
0.0	0.442768391797	Well, John, I come from the '60s, a long time ago.
0.0	0.443083326618	So John, there's a big difference between leading by polls and leading with principle.
0.0	0.443087637757	If the American people see us granting amnesty they will never again believe in legal immigration.
0.0	0.443105590423	But I believe in the Teddy Roosevelt philosophy.
0.0	0.444365055381	Barack Obama was never responsible for those decisions.
0.0	0.444612968985	He's not arming the Kurds.
0.0	0.444979473367	You know, what people are frustrated about in Washington, D.C.., and I know the folks out there tonight are incredibly frustrated because what they see is a government that doesn't work for them.
0.0	0.445348476856	What I would like for the media now is for us to be talking about why the middle class is disappearing, why we have more people in jail than any other country, why we have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, and we're the only major country on Earth without paid family and medical leave.
0.0	0.445583810709	But we have to also be very clear that we do have some continuing challenges.
0.0	0.446377144746	That will create a true 50-state national marketplace which will drive down the cost of low-cost, catastrophic health insurance.
0.0	0.446441584394	And we didn't put a single boot on the ground, and Gaddafi was deposed.
0.0	0.446465050444	I believe calling it what it is, is to say radical jihadis.
0.0	0.446892134806	Our role in the world is not to roam the globe looking for new dictators to topple.
0.0	0.448103657555	At the time, the liberal governor of Florida, who claimed he was a Republican -- his name was Charlie Crist -- he wanted to impose cap-and-trade on Florida.
0.0	0.448372074738	Well, you know, governor, I know that when you had a chance to appoint a commissioner for financial regulation, you chose an investment banker in 2010.
0.0	0.448669558733	Because in the end, my goal is not simply to live on this earth for 80 years, but to live an eternity with my creator.
0.0	0.449594140057	Together, leading the world, this country will rid our planet of this barbarous organization called ISIS.
0.0	0.449969476274	But the fact is, every single engine of government has to move when you see a crisis like that.
0.0	0.45035694586	I can tell you that as a mayor and as a governor, I learned certain disciplines which I believe are directly applicable to that very, very powerful and most important of all jobs in the United States, the president, whose first and primary duty is to protect the people of our country.
0.0	0.450895149529	And that's what you expect from a leader.
0.0	0.450922995535	This is revolutionary for education in America.
0.0	0.451003593394	It's their time to bail out the middle class, help our kids be able to go to college tuition-free.
0.0	0.451451747408	As far as the polls are concerned, Iowa, on Monday night you're going to go to a caucus site and you'll be the first Americans that vote in this election.
0.0	0.451557818917	I want to end the international embarrassment of the United States of America being the only major country on earth that doesn't guarantee health care to all people as a right, not a privilege.
0.0	0.451703620592	Well, you've got to be on top of it right away.
0.0	0.451983491659	There's probably no person I respect more in the country or in recent history than my father.
0.0	0.452188334695	Why do we continue to get ripped off by the drug companies who can charge us any prices they want?
0.0	0.45225534896	The big banks--
0.0	0.452523146427	But it's a lot safer.
0.0	0.453197275083	I am not the candidate of Wall Street...
0.0	0.453256179909	We don't need more of the same solutions.
0.0	0.453477521342	Someone who has a proven record, who has been tested, who is totally transparent.
0.0	0.453540566498	As Americans, we have shown ourselves to have the greatest military on the face of the planet, but we are not so very good at anticipating threats and appreciating just how difficult it is to build up stable democracies, to make the investments and sustainable development that we must as a nation if we are to attack the root causes of these sorts of instability.
0.0	0.454212348299	Well, (inaudible) the major issue right now is whether or not we reestablish Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.454398255883	Sit down with people like Jeff Miller, the Republican chairman of the house, and work on a bill.
0.0	0.454895333833	Let's do more -- let's do more than reverse the immunity.
0.0	0.454944864807	Well, first of all, I know that the President has appealed the decision to the Supreme Court.
0.0	0.455848983303	So the federal solution would be the Life at Conception act which is an act that would federalize the issue.
0.0	0.456825463717	But we have to also go after the gun lobby and 92 percent of Americans agree we should have universal background checks.
0.0	0.457011424047	Now, there is a difference between personal insults and attacks -- between going into the mud with ad hominems and focusing on issues and substance.
0.0	0.45794378783	And places like Seattle, like Los Angeles, like New York City, they can go higher.
0.0	0.458153034045	Not committing crimes and earn legal status where you're not cutting in front of the line for people that are patiently waiting outside.
0.0	0.458265251354	Before you get to that, though, Puerto Rico is going to have to deal with the structural problems they face.
0.0	0.458830459338	You know, for the 45-year-old construction worker out there, who is having a hard time making things meet.
0.0	0.459095354245	But the president needs to be laying the groundwork right now for the ability to slap those sanctions back on worldwide.
0.0	0.459105874243	And second of all...
0.0	0.459473509316	I think she said something like the bulk of the responsibility is not ours.
0.0	0.459987150867	Well, first of all, I had a national reporter say, you know, there's three lanes.
0.0	0.460409949303	Give people a chance.
0.0	0.460783781203	(APPLAUSE)
0.0	0.461205261082	And the issue is, the problem is, the front pages every day were dealing with it.
0.0	0.461489017289	They are not doing it now.
0.0	0.461539921785	I was in Burlington, Iowa.
0.0	0.462154848858	There's give and take.
0.0	0.462188015902	And so, look, the way that -- a stronger middle class is actually the source of economic growth.
0.0	0.462779613066	You're seeing cities like Seattle.
0.0	0.463103442965	Well, I think -- I think that is very unfair to a few you mentioned, most particularly Jordan, which has put a lot on the line for the United States, has also taken in hundreds of thousands of refugees from Syria, and has been, therefore, subjected to threats and attacks by extremists themselves.
0.0	0.463416218614	But I'm not deciding that anybody's got to make these decisions the way that I do, on the basis of what I do.
0.0	0.463502204987	It's hate action.
0.0	0.463602902184	Looking forward to it.
0.0	0.463682905385	I would want us to take our place among the nations of the world to alleviate this sort of death and the specter we saw of little kids' bodies washing up on a beach.
0.0	0.464277603071	It became popular after the attack in Paris, and San Bernardino.
0.0	0.464347140694	I mean, all of us support funding Planned Parenthood.
0.0	0.464381648235	This is not a conflict where we send in the third divisions of Marines.
0.0	0.46506909273	Marco, Marco -- he brought up my name.
0.0	0.466054132975	... and we will end the illegal immigration.
0.0	0.466096921299	... funding to them.
0.0	0.466219473804	Disparaging women, disparaging hispanics, that's not a sign of strength.
0.0	0.466441557727	Nobela (ph) is a rising entrepreneur.
0.0	0.466714931353	We've got to have them be part of our coalition.
0.0	0.466799994215	And, here's what she said to the American people.
0.0	0.466844915304	Well, we're going to have to redo the way the prescription drug industry does business.
0.0	0.467023982637	It's called the politics.
0.0	0.467623775134	ISIS is a group that wants to trigger an apocalyptic showdown in the city of Dabiq -- not the city of Dubuque; I mis-said -- mis-said that wrong once (inaudible) time -- the city of Dabiq in Syria.
0.0	0.468071682621	Are they going to stand with us against this kind of jihadi radicalism or not?
0.0	0.468473827339	Well, I think it's perfectly fair to say that we invested quite a bit in development aid.
0.0	0.468813862403	It has to be with our friends in the Arab world and our friends in Europe, the coalition that we had when we went to the first Gulf War.
0.0	0.468979908344	The guy who systematically and habitually violates the constitution on the Supreme Court?
0.0	0.46972656816	If you had the court reverse Roe v. Wade, it would become a state issue once again.
0.0	0.469822050943	The federal government can play a role in allowing them to do that, but they should not -- the process of statehood or the status of Puerto Rico won't be solved until we get to the bigger issue of how you deal with the structural economic problems they're facing right now.
0.0	0.470003294257	But the differences among us pale compared to what's happening on the Republican side.
0.0	0.470195303412	I think that was one of the worst foreign policy blunders in the more than history of the United States.
0.0	0.471959030421	I couldn't have said it better myself.
0.0	0.47209965822	And it's probably not going to happen until we have real campaign finance reform and get rid of all these superpacs, and the power of the insurance companies and the drug companies.
0.0	0.472778265444	It better not be Bernie Sanders.
0.0	0.473097993968	Because we have found a way to reduce hospital costs, so whenever we come...
0.0	0.473123364966	And then we saw that the leading candidates for president at the time, both the Republican and the Democrats, all supported it.
0.0	0.473123594857	We did it, and it worked, and nobody headed for the hills or left the state because of it.
0.0	0.473171513898	Well, thanks for having me.
0.0	0.473396597618	And I stood alongside Jeff Sessions and Steve King, and we led the fight against amnesty.
0.0	0.474603249725	And Teddy Roosevelt is right.
0.0	0.474696128709	What part is valid?
1.0	0.474710734487	It didn't say a word about legalization.
0.0	0.475242454832	No, what I said, Chris, was that the law needs to be followed.
0.0	0.475955818701	Like, I'm standing here, I -- I watched the video of Senator Cruz.
0.0	0.476445479312	Well, because you can do it without profiling, Megyn, when you do it on the facts.
0.0	0.476711039134	And, I think there should be no mandates, and no subsidies whatsoever.
0.0	0.476722989909	John, thank you, and to all of the people in Iowa, for the role you have performed in this presidential selection process.
0.0	0.476907291853	That's the difference, and that's the kind of leader we need in the White House.
0.0	0.477430843334	I saw Ted Cruz say, "we'll take citizenship off the table, and then the bill will pass, and I'm for the bill."
0.0	0.477682786453	That's just media stuff.
0.0	0.478313784801	Our government belongs to all of us, and not just the hand full of billionaires.
0.0	0.478390814212	Each one of them, you know, described their child, had a picture.
0.0	0.478415354858	And a mom of a service member of ours who served two duties in Iraq said, Governor O' Malley, please, when you're with your other candidates and colleagues on stage, please don't use the term 'boots on the ground'.
0.0	0.478811022472	Well, in fact, I would argue that the disastrous invasion of Iraq, something that I strongly opposed, has unraveled the region completely and led to the rise of al-Qaeda and to ISIS.
0.0	0.478849600795	The dictatorships have suppressed people's aspirations.
0.0	0.479394812186	He was the only Republican that didn't show up for it.
0.0	0.47942518947	I spent a lot of time in the situation room as secretary of state and there were many very difficult choices presented to us.
0.0	0.479505338224	But there is no substitute for having comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship for 11 million people, many of whom have known no other country but the United States of America.
0.0	0.479527333643	He's the greatest show on earth.
0.0	0.479845026624	Three times, she refused to answer the question, because she refuses to be held accountable for anything that goes wrong.
0.0	0.480196338825	But I do believe that is a minimum.
0.0	0.480378523707	And John Kerry described it as attacks that would be unbelievably small.
0.0	0.480632829722	We'll have mandatory E-verify, a mandatory entry/exit tracking system and until all of that is in place and all of that is working and we can prove to the people of this country that illegal immigration is under control, nothing else is going to happen.
0.0	0.481147658322	Because most of the time, they're absolutely correct.
0.0	0.48138030912	Please become part of the political revolution.
0.0	0.481598154868	Ninety-three hours.
0.0	0.481917065573	So while other candidates will talk about the things they would like to do, I actually got these things done in a state that defended not only a AAA bond rating, but the highest median income in America.
0.0	0.482330052892	In Houston, Texas, there's an organization in place because someone acted on their heart, wanted to make sure that there's no homeless veterans in Houston.
0.0	0.482618848545	There's not going to be consensus on this issue until we enforce our immigration laws.
0.0	0.482745293462	We also had attacks on two of our embassies in Tanzania, Kenya, when my husband was president.
0.0	0.482912816793	And people at home are saying they've got a problem, listen to them.
0.0	0.483069972155	Part of the problem that we have currently in the Middle East is that Assad has hung on to power with the very strong support of Russia and Iran and with the proxy of Hezbollah being there basically fighting his battles.
0.0	0.483452442962	You see something that's suspicious, you call law enforcement and let law enforcement make those decisions.
0.0	0.484730967091	The first thing -- I don't know of anyone who's not in favor of fully vetting people that are trying to come into this country, other than perhaps Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.484777478224	We saw a Muslim brotherhood president installed, and then we saw him ousted and the army back.
0.0	0.484811133719	We can create a situation for our children to be able to get a decent job to pay down their college debt.
0.0	0.484985528507	No, it would have to go through the Congress, and I know the White House has actually been working with members of Congress.
0.0	0.485146378921	Leading by fixing the things that are broken.
0.0	0.485585512081	When he ran for election in the state of Florida, he told the people of Florida, "if you elect me, I will lead the fight against amnesty."
0.0	0.486051187516	I -- I said I made a mistake on Iraq, and I would love to see Senator Sanders join with some of my colleague in addition the Senate that I see in the audience.
0.0	0.486563702181	It's not true.
0.0	0.486989531018	Border security has always been a part of that debate.
0.0	0.487723524294	Chris, the most important determination any voter is going to make in this election is who's best prepared to be Commander in Chief.
0.0	0.487774731158	He views himself not simply as the leader of Iran, but as the leader of all Muslims -- all Shia Muslims on the planet.
0.0	0.487853932424	And if we do not get our act together and listen to what the scientists say, you're going to see countries all over the world -- this is what the CIA says -- they're going to be struggling over limited amounts of water, limited amounts of land to grow their crops ask you're going to see all kinds of international conflict.
0.0	0.488136522582	I'm not that much of a socialist compared to Eisenhower.
0.0	0.488258740358	And its bankruptcy and its failure nearly destroyed us.
0.0	0.488338402874	I've spent my entire life, since I started as a young lawyer for the Children's Defense Fund, trying to figure out how we can even the odds for so many people in America, this great country of ours, who are behind, who don't have a chance.
0.0	0.489570426331	Well, first of all, I've seen polls where I'm beating Hillary Clinton pretty regularly.
0.0	0.489745557405	I know there have been people who have been fired; people who are being held accountable.
0.0	0.489993743418	They're not going to turn into stockbrokers overnight or open up a chain of car washes.
0.0	0.490202366443	I want those kids to know that if they study hard, they do their homework, regardless of the income of their families, they will in fact be able to get a college education because we are going to make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.490266625282	We now have this great accomplishment known as the Affordable Care Act, and I don't think we should have to be defending it among Democrats.
0.0	0.491091653904	She put American intelligence officers at risk for her convenience.
0.0	0.492909257749	All of us want equal pay for equal work.
0.0	0.493410438272	That's what the political revolution is about.
0.0	0.493571448261	I have made very clear that hardworking, middle-class families need a raise, not a tax increase.
0.0	0.493808760215	If I was a Puerto Rican, I'd vote for statehood so that they have full citizenship.
0.0	0.493817172751	I think that is the number one requirement.
0.0	0.493933232502	And those are made up of the FBI, state and local law enforcement.
0.0	0.493952648072	But I...
0.0	0.494365997952	And if I were president of the United States right now, I'd be lining up our allies to say that, if one crossed T or one dotted I does not occur, they are -- violate the agreement, we slap back on sanctions.
0.0	0.494547893491	Germany, many other countries do it already.
0.0	0.494711932235	The days for the Clintons in public housing are over.
0.0	0.494979041768	That's why we have this abnormal situation going on right now.
0.0	0.495130313253	The people don't work for us.
0.0	0.495834822875	I think it's fair to say that Baltimore is not now one of the safest cities in America, but the issue is...
0.0	0.496398308734	It was designed with Iowa's own Congressman Steve King and Jeff Sessions, and...
0.0	0.496841787774	You learn to create feedback mechanisms.
0.0	0.497070881362	There are a lot of things we've got to do in our country, reigning in Wall Street is certainly one of them.
0.0	0.49745441355	That beautiful young woman who's an entrepreneur who served in the military, first of all, is deserving of our respect for service in the military and the fact that she's an entrepreneur.
0.0	0.49813498689	I want this bill to be voted down.
0.0	0.498335027488	And it is a fact that the net immigration from Mexico and South has basically zeroed out.
0.0	0.498932071341	In fact, Washington said that democracy requires a virtuous people.
0.0	0.499589677153	You know, just two weeks ago was the 25th anniversary of the first Persian Gulf war.
0.0	0.499757759471	In fact, if more border security and these -- and more and more deportations were going to bring our Republican brothers and sisters to the table, it would have happened long ago.
0.0	0.5	Kathie, this was not merely theory in Maryland.
0.0	0.500076942274	John, I was the first person on this stage to say that we should accept the 65,000 Syrian refugees that were fleeing the sort of murder of ISIL, and I believe that that needs to be done with proper screening.
0.0	0.500812547792	So was Ted, but now he says it wasn't so.
0.0	0.501610856479	It means, come out from the shadows, pay a fine, earn legal status by working, by paying taxes, learning English.
0.0	0.501669505759	When we put money into the hands of working people, they're going to go out and buy goods, they're going to buy services and they're going to create jobs in doing that.
0.0	0.501751012589	Look at what happened in '08, AIG, a big insurance company, Lehman Brothers, an investment bank helped to bring our economy down.
0.0	0.503341956484	The Turks are being threatened.
0.0	0.503712660387	We'll hire 20,000 new border agents instead of 20,000 new IRS agents.
0.0	0.503715264105	What my campaign is about is a political revolution -- millions of people standing up and saying, enough is enough.
0.0	0.504082857609	But I look forward to signing that bill into law as president and auditing the Fed and providing needed accountability at the Federal Reserve.
0.0	0.504805750355	But I have never supported cap- and-trade and I never thought it was a good idea.
0.0	0.50495468414	If you look at history, John, you will find that regime change -- whether it was in the early '50s in Iran, whether it was toppling Salvador Allende in Chile, whether it is overthrowing the government of Guatemala way back when -- these invasions, these toppling of governments, regime changes have unintended consequences.
0.0	0.504970896505	The bible commands us to let our light shine on the world.
0.0	0.505115048558	And that's only the beginning of the failures that they have committed, not only in the Middle East, but all over the world, including Russia and China.
0.0	0.505627879828	The first vote hasn't been counted.
0.0	0.505659484223	... first of all...
0.0	0.505709338225	But I've also said for the most part, these issues would be left back to the states.
0.0	0.505753336243	Our identity is not based on race or ethnicity, it's based on a set of shared values.
0.0	0.506764722806	And the U.S. chamber of commerce, which hardly ever says nice things about Democratic governors anywhere, named our state number one for innovation and entrepreneurship.
0.0	0.506933755675	Look, the threat we face from ISIS is unprecedented.
