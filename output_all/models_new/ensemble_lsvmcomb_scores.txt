0.0	0.0868515614456	He doesn't want to hear the talk about politics Megyn and who is establishment and who is grassroots.
0.0	0.0937551032278	And that's a tragedy because now...
0.0	0.0965796725466	And then when we win that, and we will win that against ISIS as it settles down, and we should leave.
0.0	0.0970134965596	And what is missing is the political will, because too many Democrats and, sadly, too many Republicans don't want to solve this problem.
0.0	0.0994100326806	And we have no quarrel with the Iranian people.
0.0	0.104314728697	And I don't think you have to be a politician to tell the truth.
0.0	0.106052768548	So they clearly think I'm going to do what I say I will do and you can look at what I did in the Senate.
0.0	0.108091985387	Listen, I think that what people should do is use their common sense.
0.0	0.109901662116	What we need is leadership in this country which revitalizes American democracy, and makes people understand that if they stand up and fight back and take on the billionaire class, we can bring about the change that we need.
0.0	0.111004829351	And guess what?
0.0	0.11160663876	But we don't see it happening at all.
0.0	0.112034670632	Look at what's happening with the Republicans.
0.0	0.112689515166	Look, first of all, I recognize that Vladimir Putin is an opportunist and he's a bully, and we have to face him down.
0.0	0.113333089851	It's really a question for all of us to answer, every single one of our children deserves the chance to live up to his or her god-given potential.
0.0	0.115524103017	It is not tough talk.
0.0	0.115615410487	We need to define the enemy.
0.0	0.116330790276	Megyn, that's the problem.
0.0	0.116759088288	And that's not what's happening now.
0.0	0.116935553283	Afghanistan is a mess.
0.0	0.117512236756	And it is imperative that we do more not only to help our friends and partners protect themselves and protect our own homeland, but also to work to try to deal with this arc of instability, which does have a lot of impact on what happens in a country like Libya.
0.0	0.118952294214	I think if you do not understand that our Judeo-Christian values are one of the reasons why America is such a special country, you don't understand our history.
0.0	0.119379279851	Historically, it is important to try to understand your adversary in order to figure out how they are thinking, what they will be doing, how they will react.
0.0	0.121000408237	You know, maybe they're dumb and they don't know what they're going to get, but I don't think so.
0.0	0.121355623271	Yes, I agree.
0.0	0.121444921589	Talk about what?
0.0	0.124225563234	We've gotten off the Hillary's e-mails, good.
0.0	0.124855059411	Do you know where I'm going, Kevin?
0.0	0.126906255696	The radical Islamic jihadists, what they want to do is impose their faith upon each and every one of us -- every one of us.
0.0	0.126929381322	But I think if we're ever going to really tackle the problems posed by jihadi extreme terrorism, we need to understand it and realize that it has antecedents to what happened in Iraq and we have to continue to be vigilant about it.
0.0	0.12714334149	If we don't know who you are, or why you're coming, you will not get into the United States.
0.0	0.127224102177	I will do everything I can as president to get that accomplished.
0.0	0.128365308545	And that's the difference between somebody who knows how to do this and somebody who's never done it before.
0.0	0.128926059823	And I know that term gets my Republican friends nervous.
0.0	0.130054530336	Okay, thank you.
0.0	0.132954769845	Now we hear the tough talk.
0.0	0.133800027355	I agree completely.
0.0	0.136020762418	... that stage, and that is exactly what I am ready to do.
0.0	0.136877558174	As a Catholic, that's what I want to do.
0.0	0.136967842686	And now, like never before, we need our Muslim American neighbors to stand up and to -- and to be a part of this.
0.0	0.138266619603	I'm glad he has produced enormous enthusiasm, and, every Donald Trump voter or potential voter, I hope to earn your support.
0.0	0.139217924519	I know everyone else on this stage hopes to earn your support.
0.0	0.14002169799	What he wants is something to get done.
0.0	0.140198313119	If you want to make it into the middle class -- I'm not saying in all cases -- we need plumbers, and we need carpenters, and electricians, that's for sure, and they should get help as well.
0.0	0.140366411459	And the fact is that we need a commander-in- chief who not only understands how to protect us, but feels in here what it means to face the possibility of loss.
0.0	0.140733259262	We need to mobilize the entire country to treat our veterans and treat them with much more respect than they get today.
0.0	0.141465068534	So there's a lot of work we need to do and I want to be sure what's called the AUMF, has the authority that is needed going forward.
0.0	0.143598907047	Well, let me be clear, if Donald engages in insults or anybody else, I don't intend to reciprocate.
0.0	0.145314016882	We know about the Brits.
0.0	0.145888064993	That's American capitalism.
0.0	0.146113548847	But John, let's not fall into the trap of thinking that all of our Muslim American neighbors in this country are somehow our enemies here.
0.0	0.146272139034	But I want to be frank about what I stand for.
0.0	0.147107353967	Stop the Washington bull and let's get things done.
0.0	0.147648446847	And we have -- and let me make this promise.
0.0	0.148632427339	Well, I'll tell you who is on my side.
0.0	0.149096219471	Reestablish Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.150674324681	As such, everybody is welcome from any race, any country, any religion, if they want to be Americans.
0.0	0.152311602016	And I think this is an important question.
0.0	0.152874242898	So we have a unique opportunity to bring everybody together.
0.0	0.153462592752	And when you see a problem, you must act quickly to get on top of it.
0.0	0.154137639496	Everybody knows that.
0.0	0.154143646049	Yes -- thank you.
0.0	0.154603508091	But here's something that I believe we have to do as we put together an international coalition, and that is we have to understand that the Muslim nations in the region -- Saudi Arabia, Iran, Turkey, Jordan -- all of these nations, they're going to have to get their hands dirty, their boots on the ground.
0.0	0.155638687328	We have got to come forward with a consensus that in fact will work.
0.0	0.155802622206	That's what should be done.
0.0	0.157369086861	As president of the United States, that is exactly what I will do.
0.0	0.157711132735	... What was your question...
0.0	0.157948672822	And what we need to do is bring people together to work on the agreement where there is broad consensus and that's what I intend to do.
0.0	0.157972822985	We know about the Belgians.
0.0	0.160085039259	So let's focus on what this election is really going to be about.
0.0	0.160134462575	I've heard a lot about me in this debate, and I'm going to keep talking and thinking about all of you because ultimately, I think the president's job is to do everything possible, everything that she can do to lift up the people of this country.
0.0	0.160759150238	But Bret, here's the problem.
0.0	0.160894936753	I'm running hard and I believe I'll be the Republican nominee and I'll be the one best suited to beat Hillary Clinton, who should not be president of the United States.
0.0	0.161268953793	And I know that securing our borders is not anti-immigrant and we will do it.
0.0	0.161496234425	Yeah, but look.
0.0	0.161895871386	So, I mean this may seem like a bit of an arcane discussion.
0.0	0.162222425624	Look, we need more Americans to be involved in the political process.
0.0	0.162381866287	And when I'm president, I can tell you this, my faith will not just influence the way I'll govern as president, it will influence the way I live my life.
0.0	0.16257387966	Yeah, but let me respond...
0.0	0.16388841804	Oh, great.
0.0	0.165069850555	I think God has blessed this country with enormous natural resources, and we should pursue all of the above.
0.0	0.165071637883	And I will be laying out in detail, what I think we need to do with our friends and allies in Europe and elsewhere to do a better job of coordinating efforts against the scourge of terrorism.
0.0	0.165685491542	So I hope and pray and cannot wait until this state and others give me an opportunity to serve this party as its nominee because I will defeat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.165922300201	And that's what I will do as your president.
0.0	0.166762408909	I do agree that in particular, Turkey and the Gulf nations have got to make up their minds.
0.0	0.166778552524	I mean, you know, let's not be naive about it.
0.0	0.166887487768	I think they'd want to hear it.
0.0	0.167544408018	Yeah.
0.0	0.167544408018	Yeah.
0.0	0.167544408018	Yeah.
0.0	0.167798317423	But just as importantly, and I agree with what John said.
0.0	0.168091817466	The issue now is do we break them ?up do we reestablish Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.168257408502	You're not going to hear a lot of polished political speech from me, but you will hear the truth.
0.0	0.168692491348	The fact is what we need is someone on that stage who has been tested, who has been through it, who has made decisions, who has sit (ph) in the chair of consequence and can prosecute the case against Hillary Clinton on...
0.0	0.16873475652	The fact of the matter is -- and let's say it in our debate, because you'll never hear this from that immigration-bashing carnival barker, Donald Trump, the truth of the matter is...
0.0	0.16900969793	Now, what the magic number is, I don't know, because we don't know the extent of the problem.
0.0	0.169162086587	We listen to you and -- and then we act.
0.0	0.16989076964	And you should hope that our next president is someone that is influence by their faith.
0.0	0.171874489099	And in talking to a lot of our neighbors who are in that super wealthy, millionaire and billionaire category, a great numbers of them love their country enough to do more again in order to create more opportunity for America's middle class.
0.0	0.172117885302	Well, Chris, I will apologize to nobody for the vigorousness with which I will fight terrorism, go after ISIS, hunt them down wherever they are, and utterly and completely destroy ISIS.
0.0	0.173236249171	What that is, is just common sense.
0.0	0.173258651522	That is what I want to do.
0.0	0.173423945162	I do think that it's important to defend it.
0.0	0.175206446284	So, we do need to take on the Republicans very clearly and directly.
0.0	0.175551360298	Didn't just happen.
0.0	0.175798206446	Kathie, I think -- Kathie the...
0.0	0.175923777443	But I think on the broader question of religion and politics, you know, I think liberty, itself requires a virtue -- requires a virtuous people.
0.0	0.176502836491	I feel like I need -- I feel like I need a Washington to English dictionary converter, right?
0.0	0.177243558824	And until that happens there's not going to be consensus on this issue.
0.0	0.177753054736	I feel like...
0.0	0.177771960137	But what -- I will tell you this.
0.0	0.178382929169	And that this world, with American leadership, can and must come together to destroy them.
0.0	0.178510842089	But wait, I just want to say this Senator.
0.0	0.179251584583	That is what is going to have to happen, if we want to revitalize and rebuild the crumbling middle class.
0.0	0.179374407648	And, I'll tell you something else.
0.0	0.179622243628	I think that is...
0.0	0.180659178724	And we can get a lot of them out if we get the government out of our lives.
0.0	0.181324890107	Sure.
0.0	0.181520391126	... we will secure the border...
0.0	0.181973494838	Examine our records, pray on it and I will be honored if you and your family will come caucus for us on Monday night.
0.0	0.182779273632	I think any parent would be so proud of them.
0.0	0.182816331904	And that's why I've been clear, when I am the president of the United States of America, we don't know who you are, and we don't know why you're trying to come to the United States, you are not going to get in, because the radical threat that we now face from ISIS is extraordinary and unprecedented...
0.0	0.183709715654	And, you know, take advantage of the tremendous opportunities in energy that God has given us, not get involved in these little petty arguments.
0.0	0.184042716368	... and I'd like to respond.
0.0	0.184091855034	Well, as anyone knows who's been listening to me, you know?
0.0	0.184105830971	So I'm confident if I win this nomination, I will aggressively go against her and beat her.
0.0	0.185088623445	We need to bring together our European and our Sunni Arab allies, and we need to develop a strategy together to take on ISIS every place that it is around the world, so that together, all of us can take ISIS out, destroy it, and then move on to come back to our country, protect our homeland security and make sure that the American people are safe.
0.0	0.185600067914	She wants to pursue the American dream.
0.0	0.185615516182	Thank you.
0.0	0.185615516182	Thank you.
0.0	0.185615516182	Thank you.
0.0	0.185615516182	Thank you.
0.0	0.185615516182	Thank you.
0.0	0.185615516182	Thank you.
0.0	0.18595637196	That's exactly what I'll do as president of the United States.
0.0	0.186647184846	Caucus for me on Monday night because if I am your nominee, I will unite this party and I will defeat Hillary Clinton and when I'm president, America's light will shine again and the 21 century will be a new American century.
0.0	0.187795758959	I don't think we're at war with all Muslims.
0.0	0.188044461832	And that is what we have done in Ohio.
0.0	0.188115783368	I'll take that, too.
0.0	0.188288479013	I mean, that's a fact.
0.0	0.189226718692	Well, I believe, and I know that if Iowa helps make me the Republican nominee, I will defeat Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.189839533819	So, I want to look at the whole problem and that's why my proposal is much more comprehensive than anything else that's been put forth.
0.0	0.189854299223	I don't think the term is what's important.
0.0	0.190155304412	And, I'll tell you one other thing, you know why the Republican party will want to take a chance on me?
0.0	0.190402160051	I know, Bret.
0.0	0.19068811901	And I think that's a mistake, and I just don't think Marco can have it both ways.
0.0	0.190749600973	And I will always allow my faith to influence everything I do.
0.0	0.191304512798	Radical Muslims and radical Islam is not just hate talk.
0.0	0.19137531958	You should stick with it and that's exactly what happened.
0.0	0.191692526906	You learn to constantly evaluate and understand the nature of the threats that you are being faced with.
0.0	0.192198452155	... but wait a minute...
0.0	0.192472125558	Exactly what to do as it relates to ISIS.
0.0	0.1926214027	And, you know, I don't know all the details of what Rick Snyder has done.
0.0	0.192951850245	We've got the consensus, what we're lacking is political leadership...
0.0	0.193520908886	As president I will restore and rebuild our military, restore the alliances and keep us safe.
0.0	0.193703871274	That's what really matters.
0.0	0.193770145955	That's not the America that I think we should be.
0.0	0.193861630052	Thank you Chris...
0.0	0.194335175455	The fact of the matter is, the more our people earn, the more money they spend, and the more our whole economy grows.
0.0	0.194810521554	I like how you stand up.
0.0	0.195141665234	And, they've insinuated themselves into everything.
0.0	0.19514757064	When I'm president, that will change.
0.0	0.195276747952	And, I'm going to tell you exactly how we're going to deal with it when I am president.
0.0	0.195465519085	Yes, we must protect our borders.
0.0	0.195810794159	Libya is now a mess.
0.0	0.195914884433	Who are we kidding?
0.0	0.196173208821	We have -- I don't know that there's any disagreement here...
0.0	0.196309981661	We need people who think out of the box and can solve problems; can utilize the resources around them; very smart people, to focus on the problem and solve the problem.
0.0	0.19648532715	John, I don't think that there is a crisis at the state or local level that really you can point to and say, therefore, I am prepared for the sort of crises that any man or woman who is commander in chief of our country has to deal with.
0.0	0.19668494415	One of the problems we have had -- I think all Americans understand this, is whether it's Republican administrations or Democratic administrations, we have seen Wall Street and Goldman Sachs dominate administrations.
0.0	0.196686313515	But if we don't know right and wrong, I think we have lost our way.
0.0	0.196897410396	I don't think so.
0.0	0.196993534586	And I'm so grateful for the diligence, for the seriousness with which the men and women of Iowa approach this process.
0.0	0.197199499136	What we need to do is lead an international coalition which includes very significantly the Muslim nations in that region who are going to have to fight and defend their way of life.
0.0	0.197824326517	I think that there are many other reasons why it has in addition to what happened in the region, but I don't think that the United States has the bulk of the responsibility.
0.0	0.197939751401	The issue is -- I believe, and I believe this honestly, and I don't know that there's much difference on guns between us.
0.0	0.198033897422	You can -- you can deal with the threat of terror and also recognize that this country should be aspirational across the board.
0.0	0.19810929457	I'll keep -- I'll keep heading in that direction, believe me.
0.0	0.198669533534	The Shi'a-Sunni split.
0.0	0.198967684595	Fine, I'll take it.
0.0	0.199351974351	And I would hope in the midst of all of this discussion, this country makes certain that we do not turn our backs on the men and women who put their lives on the line to defend us, and that we stand with them as they have stood with us.
0.0	0.19995027031	And it is easy to talk the talk about ending Citizens United, but what I think we need to do is show by example that we are prepared to not rely on large corporations and Wall Street for campaign contributions, and that's what I'm doing.
0.0	0.200808817405	But what we need to do is turn it over to the regional powers to be able to handle that.
0.0	0.200839556557	Well, there are so many, I don't know where to start.
0.0	0.202139110447	And we do have a role in this.
0.0	0.202178986001	Look--
0.0	0.202226699498	And we will always celebrate legal immigration like Dulce's great story.
0.0	0.202418117735	You know, I like Marco.
0.0	0.203183300703	We can develop that, you know?
0.0	0.203226780937	Thank you, Marco.
0.0	0.203270509203	And I'll tell you what I'm worried about -- I'm worried about money.
0.0	0.20347647706	But I'm not deciding that anybody's got to make these decisions the way that I do, on the basis of what I do.
0.0	0.204182815376	But we have a unique time in America to connect with people all around the world that understand that there's an existential threat against all of them, the Arabs, the Jordanians, the Saudis, the Egyptians, our friends in Europe, including the Turks.
0.0	0.204199981726	But it will be...
0.0	0.204548687522	Now, secondly, let me say I'm a maniac and everyone on this stage is stupid, fat, and ugly.
0.0	0.20529147407	When you talk about the long-term consequences of war, let's talk about the men and women who came home from war.
0.0	0.20567611297	I did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild.
0.0	0.20602485072	Terrorism in this country scares everyone.
0.0	0.206409328505	Well, I think that they're be pretty smart, because I think a lot of the states will do the right thing, and I think those states that don't will pay a heavy penalty.
0.0	0.207233965259	It's called the politics.
0.0	0.207549195893	But they need to be absolutely clear about where they stand.
0.0	0.20798356263	And it isn't because I'm all that great.
0.0	0.208488644844	Well, I agree with Rand that I very much respect Ron Paul and that I think anyone who is able to win in the Republican Party has to be able to bring together the disparate elements of the Reagan coalition.
0.0	0.208856838471	It all will be scrutinized.
0.0	0.209028028696	It should always be going up.
0.0	0.209458636883	That is why we have troops in Iraq that are helping to train and build back up the Iraqi military, why we have special operators in Syria working with the Kurds and Arabs, so that we can be supportive.
0.0	0.209599743723	So let's move toward what we should be doing as a nation and follow the values of our immigration history and begin to make it possible for them to come out of the shadows and to have a future that gives them a full chance of citizenship.
0.0	0.209967522718	And no matter what your faith is, that's what I want you to be able to do.
0.0	0.211731609808	There is no reason why you can't stand for principles, go and fight for them and be able also, to have to get things done in government.
0.0	0.212079436307	And frankly, if you want to be commander in chief, you have to have the experience.
0.0	0.212160626986	I think with this kind of barbarism and nihilism, it's very hard to understand, other than the lust for power, the rejection of modernity, the total disregard for human rights, freedom, or any other value that we know and respect.
0.0	0.212167211014	I will...
0.0	0.212536561016	So actually, the opportunity is there, because of the threat to all of these countries, to bring all of us together...
0.0	0.212906716433	I think, frankly, if you have border security, you can have legalization.
0.0	0.213570441507	But when you're a governor, you have to admit it.
0.0	0.213804705887	And I think what the president has consistently said-- which I agree with-- is that we will support those who take the fight to ISIS.
0.0	0.213919738571	And if we do not get our act together and listen to what the scientists say, you're going to see countries all over the world -- this is what the CIA says -- they're going to be struggling over limited amounts of water, limited amounts of land to grow their crops ask you're going to see all kinds of international conflict.
0.0	0.215139941846	Those are the kinds of things that we ought to be doing.
0.0	0.215635349866	We know about the French.
0.0	0.215714737257	But I don't want us to be painting with too broad a brush.
0.0	0.216392458888	I want to thank everyone here for showing the men and women of Iowa the respect to show up and make the case to the people of this state and the people of the country why each of us believe we would make the best commander in chief.
0.0	0.216595988769	And they're going to tell us where the terrorists are.
0.0	0.217341041482	So for me, it is looking at what works and what we need to do to try to move past what happened in '08.
0.0	0.217918164375	And I believe that Puerto Rico ought to have the right of self-determination.
0.0	0.218210282274	It's not for them to make those decisions about whether or not something is legal or illegal, or profiling or not.
0.0	0.218459699051	Syria is a mess.
0.0	0.218726799585	Chris...
0.0	0.219152565431	That's fair game but that's where I'm going to focus.
0.0	0.219238451364	You want to make the Veterans Administration do a better job, give them -- give veterans choices and you'll get a much better result.
0.0	0.219336681482	You learn to create a security cabinet.
0.0	0.219673115491	And a lot of people are doing that.
0.0	0.219872340936	I've had a lot of folks give me donations from all kinds of backgrounds say, I don't agree with you on everything, but I like what you do.
0.0	0.219952522443	Because I've seen so many things get accomplished in my lifetime.
0.0	0.220797254233	There are a lot of things we've got to do in our country, reigning in Wall Street is certainly one of them.
0.0	0.220897277635	We need to rebuild the military to defeat the enemy.
0.0	0.220964725905	I don't think we're at war with Islam.
0.0	0.221248299922	I plead that it's very difficult when you deal with ISIS and organizations like that whose behavior is so barbaric and so vicious that it doesn't seem to have any purpose other than lust for killing and power and that's very difficult to put ourselves in the other shoe.
0.0	0.221455179348	See, I think there is an opportunity to bring the world together.
0.0	0.222110045394	But what happened at the university there, what's happening at other universities, I think reflects the deep sense of, you know, concern, even despair that so many young people, particularly of color, have...
0.0	0.222538527365	More importantly, I want kids in Burlington, Vermont, or Baltimore, Maryland, who are in the sixth grade or the eighth grade, who don't have a lot of money, whose parents -- like my parents -- may never have gone to college.
0.0	0.222861804803	Jeb, please attack Ted..."
0.0	0.222901071512	Everybody is under fire and under attack, and we have to stand together as an alliance.
0.0	0.223030668976	That's a part of the problem and I am going right at them.
0.0	0.223650872942	Wait a minute, he has basically used his answer to impune my integrity.
0.0	0.223818341518	They can do business with Iran, or they can do business with America, and I am very confident they're going to choose America before they choose the Iranian economy.
0.0	0.224278976684	... and when I'm president, we are keeping ISIS out of America.
0.0	0.224307709529	Who has the experience, who has the knowledge, who has the judgement, who has the clarity, and vision and strength of resolve to keep this country safe.
0.0	0.224355168321	Our country deserves no less, because all of the other issues we want to deal with depend upon us being secure and strong.
0.0	0.224574759704	You don't serve us.
0.0	0.225001780328	You know, need to stop allowing political correctness to dictate our policies, because it's going to kill us if we don't.
0.0	0.225600639903	We serve you.
0.0	0.225684275091	We need to have a resolve that will bring the world together to root out the kind of radical jihadist ideology that motivates organizations like ISIS, a barbaric, ruthless, violent jihadist terrorist group.
0.0	0.225905704126	I think the only argument is are we a sovereign country, are we not allowed to choose who comes in, when they come in and how they come in?
0.0	0.227072909977	I do believe that people who are trying to come to the United States -- this country has a right to know who they are and why they are coming.
0.0	0.227390101014	Let me get a chance to respond.
0.0	0.22751573421	The dictatorships have suppressed people's aspirations.
0.0	0.227762948999	We the people of the United States in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare and secure the benefits of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this constitution of the United States of America.
0.0	0.228155104944	Who do you know will stop amnesty and secure the borders?
0.0	0.22824297012	Chris?
0.0	0.22832073839	And the fact is this is what makes a difference when you're a governor.
0.0	0.228652582315	Oh, yes there is.
0.0	0.229272295501	That can be done.
0.0	0.230363641725	The problem is...
0.0	0.230375540999	they expect to get something.
0.0	0.23047299058	The time has come to stop ignoring the mentally ill in this country and begin to treat them and get them on their feet, along with, of course, with treating the drug-addicted.
0.0	0.230785235222	But the Iranian leader, their supreme leader is a radical Shia cleric who has an apocalyptic vision of the future.
0.0	0.230791100376	Well, thank you, John.
0.0	0.231486734817	Well, Chris, I'm glad to discuss my views on ethanol and energy.
0.0	0.231576508945	But what's wrong is your premise in the question.
0.0	0.231644876683	... and I encourage everybody watching this tonight to please, acknowledge that by going online at martinomalley.com and help me wage this campaign for real American capitalism.
0.0	0.231894472035	Well John, wait a minute.
0.0	0.232147278653	Listen, we can solve immigration.
0.0	0.232295195088	What I've always said is that this issue does need to be solved.
0.0	0.232480005542	... it's harder and harder to actually solve this problem.
0.0	0.232899675749	But the bottom line is we must have virtue, we must have a religious bearing as a nation.
0.0	0.233062251734	You've got to be able to bring together conservatives and evangelicals and libertarians, and stitch together a winning majority.
0.0	0.233841520379	And we are going to be able to defeat ISIS on the ground there, as well as in this world, because of the Muslim Americans in our country and throughout the world who understand that this brutal and barbaric group is perverting the name of a great world religion.
0.0	0.234050992459	Maybe now we can get it moving again so that we can upgrade it so that it does include all the tools and everything in our arsenal that we can use to try to work with our allies and our friends, come up with better intelligence.
0.0	0.234518555809	Hillary doesn't want to run against me, but I cannot wait to run against her.
0.0	0.23483856249	I will be ready.
0.0	0.234890365889	America is best when we work in collaboration with our allies.
0.0	0.234966687003	That's what I understand is the request from the international...
0.0	0.235427773593	This entire question was an attack, but that's (inaudible)
0.0	0.235746039809	You know, we probably have to figure out a way to make sure that we keep America safe.
0.0	0.236550226894	Please think of our founding fathers as you listen.
0.0	0.236735287142	Now, there has been a lot of turmoil and trouble as they have tried to deal with these radical elements which you find in this arc of instability, from north Africa to Afghanistan.
0.0	0.237102672324	Parents, and sons, and daughters and family members, and as our hearts go out to them and as our prayers go out to them, we must remember this, that this isn't the new face of conflict and warfare, not in the 20th century but the new face of conflict and warfare in the 21st century.
0.0	0.237583265227	It's great to be back.
0.0	0.237599638507	So, there does need to be a whole of government approach, but just because we're involved and we have a strategy doesn't mean we're going to be able to dictate the outcome.
0.0	0.23767950863	Who do you know will defend life, marriage and religious liberty?
0.0	0.237948473609	I've gotten to do some incredible things.
0.0	0.240425846908	All of that together, we're going to be just fine and America is going to continue to lead the world.
0.0	0.240478930651	O' Malley: John, please, it's-- personal privilege, John.
0.0	0.24053920754	Thank you very much.
0.0	0.24066873554	And so in no way have I ever said that I don't embrace my father or love my father or appreciate everything that he has done for the country.
0.0	0.240862864227	I agree with that.
0.0	0.240932750914	And many of the fights that are going on are not ones that the United States has either started or have a role in.
0.0	0.241088917018	... and say there is something more important than money.
0.0	0.241405993881	But they should have the right of determine -- self-determination.
0.0	0.241462510142	I will work my heart out.
0.0	0.241496209092	Thank you, John.
0.0	0.24262900801	I talked to a diplomat from Belgium.
0.0	0.243042635714	And yes, when I am president of the United States, if there is some place in this country where radical jihadists are planning to attack the United States, we will go after them wherever they are, and if we capture them alive, they are going to Guantanamo.
0.0	0.243126222974	I'm all about making sure we actually get results for whatever we do.
0.0	0.243137652758	I think we become unmoored and I think without the religious foundation that guides us all, I think we have a great risk of going horribly in the wrong direction.
0.0	0.243205334555	But the other thing I just wanted quickly to say is, I think President Obama deserves more credit than he gets for what he got done in Washington, despite the Republican obstructionists.
0.0	0.243221206076	If you -- we will not solve our nation's problems by resorting to the divisive ideologies of our past, or by returning to polarizing figures from our past.
0.0	0.243322234852	Well, let's take it one at a time.
0.0	0.243411671833	He's very charming.
0.0	0.243749650008	DICKERSON: A question from Kathie Obradovich.
0.0	0.244047439723	And so if there's someone in that organization, and it turns out there was, who was willing to be able to do that, that's what we should do.
0.0	0.244218208377	We want to be the United States of America.
0.0	0.244218208377	We want to be the United States of America.
0.0	0.245454294728	We never dreamt we'd ever see it."
0.0	0.245457247448	Thank you very, very much.
0.0	0.245840029542	We can build the fence.
0.0	0.245865922602	Look what they did in San Bernardino.
0.0	0.246309301785	And it's not just a question for parents and grandparents to answer.
0.0	0.24655103333	And it's-- it's a worthy debate.
0.0	0.247112618108	John, I think somewhere between...
0.0	0.247773497672	And we have to have an attitude when we're in government of serving-hood.
0.0	0.248281117536	Yeah, I would encourage people to go on my website, marcorubio.com, and we'll put all the facts up there so people can see it for themselves.
0.0	0.248900352911	But it cannot be an American fight.
0.0	0.248986771473	I think we're at war with jihadists who have --
0.0	0.249056956598	I would like to see it updated.
0.0	0.249137660126	But in order to bring about the changes that we need, we need a political revolution.
0.0	0.249145001084	I kind of miss him.
0.0	0.249281672179	Well, let me tell you what the country should really be worried about.
0.0	0.249583541132	Not solely ours, but we must work collaboratively with other nations.
0.0	0.249740365926	But it's a falseness, and that's an authenticity problem -- that everybody he knows is not as perfect as him because we're all for amnesty.
0.0	0.249879852736	Chris, please attack Ted.
0.0	0.250238598414	There won't be any -- you can get it.
0.0	0.250742463152	The caliphate of ISIS has to be destroyed, which means we need to arm directly to Kurds, imbed our troops with the Iraqi military, re engage with the Sunni tribal leaders.
0.0	0.251594630334	But...
0.0	0.251842900145	I think something has to change.
0.0	0.252409336669	We don't want to be Sweden.
0.0	0.252957499797	That's why when I'm president we are going to rebuild our intelligence capabilities.
0.0	0.252975630858	They serve in the military.
0.0	0.252980578675	And if our middle class makes more money, they spend more money, and our whole economy grows.
0.0	0.252984977979	Marco, please attack Ted.
0.0	0.253198657355	But, more importantly, to train a Sunni-led force in Syria to take out ISIS with our support...
0.0	0.253796318811	I think what's interesting about where that liberty vote goes that my father brought to the Republican Party is, I don't think they're necessarily going to go for Ted.
0.0	0.253831095272	We must able to work collaboratively with others.
0.0	0.25390287076	And Ben, you're a terrible surgeon.
0.0	0.254138701146	I'm going to be independent.
0.0	0.254218952087	There has never been a jihadist group like this.
0.0	0.254378382979	But I do take what Alan Krueger said seriously.
0.0	0.254408696761	We need to deal with ISIS in the caliphate.
0.0	0.255044665707	Well, I will gladly confess that I'm the only one on this stage with no political title.
0.0	0.255204531135	That beautiful young woman who's an entrepreneur who served in the military, first of all, is deserving of our respect for service in the military and the fact that she's an entrepreneur.
0.0	0.255634561542	The American people have been told for 30 years they're going to enforce the border, they're going to build a wall and it never gets built and it never happens.
0.0	0.255703598681	We have to come together as a country.
0.0	0.255798298686	But I had to stand up and come back and get the best that we could.
0.0	0.255926058141	...
0.0	0.255926058141	...
0.0	0.255926058141	...
0.0	0.255926058141	...
0.0	0.255926058141	...
0.0	0.255926058141	...
0.0	0.255926058141	...
0.0	0.255926058141	...
0.0	0.255926058141	...
0.0	0.256047525218	This actually is America's fight.
0.0	0.256112092196	And if you want to know who's telling the truth, you should look and ask people like Jeff Sessions and Steve King and Rush Limbaugh and Mark Levin, all of whom say, as Jeff Sessions said, responding to these false attacks just recently in Alabama -- he said, "if it wasn't for Ted Cruz, the Gang of Eight Rubio/Schumer bill would have passed.
0.0	0.256461911225	At the same time we're doing all that, the Pentagon must be reformed so we get what we need for our men and women in uniform.
0.0	0.256630680277	But those Muslim countries are going to have to lead the effort.
0.0	0.256896370908	More and more military personnel are leaving becoming veterans, and the waiting list grows.
0.0	0.257825034393	They want to say they're getting some of the liberty vote.
0.0	0.258150925001	But Megyn...
0.0	0.259495933426	That's his first responsibility.
0.0	0.259695186617	I kind of miss Donald Trump.
0.0	0.260065634324	OK.
0.0	0.260273952111	I think we have a disagreement, and the disagreement is that not only did I vote against the war in Iraq.
0.0	0.260376850796	If I am elected president, keep an eye on the tarmac, because I'll be back, because Iowa in 2017 will not be fly-over country.
0.0	0.260831553403	And we can do it again together, all of us, to strengthen this country, work together.
0.0	0.261038759149	I really put that on Assad and on the Iraqis and on the region itself.
0.0	0.261043683019	And what I hear is people's concern that the economy we have is a rigged economy.
0.0	0.261093528022	I'd like to take a matter of personal privilege here...
0.0	0.261158407834	Please go to hillaryclinton.com and be part of making this country what we know it can and should be.
0.0	0.261424502227	We always had such a loving relationship in these debates and in between and the tweets.
0.0	0.26171400621	There will be a process.
0.0	0.261779947433	It -- it doesn't need to be that way.
0.0	0.261924782346	Well, Bret, first that's not entirely the story.
0.0	0.26207907013	You know, I've always had a great deal of respect.
0.0	0.262173495223	They want to trigger an apocalyptic Armageddon showdown.
0.0	0.262690358787	Chris, let's begin by being clear what this campaign is about.
0.0	0.262696230779	I honored my commitments, and as president, I will honor every commitment that I make to the men and women of this country.
0.0	0.263130181949	That's what our parents and grandparents always did.
0.0	0.264092704094	The threat is Islamic terrorism.
0.0	0.264344360688	Let me hear if there's any difference between the Secretary and myself.
0.0	0.264479507748	That's why I've got such a good plan.
0.0	0.265315130728	I think we all support that.
0.0	0.265388152769	And if you listen to what they say -- and I had a chance over those 11 hours to watch and listen, as well as what I see in their debates -- they are putting forth alarming plans.
0.0	0.265549224431	Bret, we're just starting.
0.0	0.265849214936	You will be the first Americans that get to answer the fundamental question, what comes next for this country after seven disastrous years of Barack Obama?
0.0	0.26618812159	That is the issue.
0.0	0.266456763799	I'm going to support you, and I think that is absolutely appropriate.
0.0	0.266725917398	It was an excruciating experience.
0.0	0.266861636146	But -- but we are going to end the absurdity, as Warren Buffet often remind us.
0.0	0.266883440627	Break them up.
0.0	0.267392402155	There's give and take.
0.0	0.267399551166	We do have to take a hard look at the defense budget and we do have to figure out how we get ready to fight the adversaries of the future, not the past.
0.0	0.267400398567	Because we don't want them in and out -- we don't want them in and out of the prisons.
0.0	0.267409968984	Bret, let me tell you, this is another one of those places where Hillary Clinton has so much to answer for, and why she is completely unqualified to be commander in chief.
0.0	0.267418448793	... do I go -- let me go first, and then you can please recognize Rand after.
0.0	0.267578315059	And so -- and I've always made that clear about that cover story.
0.0	0.267918982844	Yes.
0.0	0.267918982844	Yes.
0.0	0.267918982844	Yes.
0.0	0.267918982844	Yes.
0.0	0.267918982844	Yes.
0.0	0.267918982844	Yes.
0.0	0.267918982844	Yes.
0.0	0.267918982844	Yes.
0.0	0.267918982844	Yes.
0.0	0.268076386154	Please go to berniesanders.com.
0.0	0.268223474574	I ask for your support on the caucuses come Monday night and I will make you proud as our party's nominee.
0.0	0.268274655323	But I certainly think that the United States should take its full responsibility in helping those people.
0.0	0.268720860617	That is what the Democrats in the Senate have put forward as a proposal.
0.0	0.26978398538	I want to ask the people of the audience.
0.0	0.270028624342	Let me...
0.0	0.270028624342	Let's...
0.0	0.270155162136	If they hear people running for president who basically shortcut it to say we are somehow against Islam, that was one of the real contributions, despite all the other problems, that George W. Bush made after 9/11 when he basically said after going to a Mosque in Washington, we are not at war with Islam or Muslims.
0.0	0.270391665779	That is what we have to do.
0.0	0.270414611029	Chris, the most important determination any voter is going to make in this election is who's best prepared to be Commander in Chief.
0.0	0.271261205108	I need your help.
0.0	0.271261205108	I need your help.
0.0	0.271477904358	Right.
0.0	0.271479808416	But I would say this to you, Bret.
0.0	0.27148281694	That is what this debate is all about, and I would suggest let's stay focused on those issues -- rather than just attacks directed at each other.
0.0	0.271763853948	And there are many ways of doing it.
0.0	0.271870458838	That's not true.
0.0	0.272000355383	And the reason why this war against them is so important is that very basis of religious liberty.
0.0	0.272282675619	And when he moved on his own people, threatening a massacre, genocide, the Europeans and the Arabs, our allies and partners, did ask for American help and we provided it.
0.0	0.272692549754	And we need someone who will take on Hillary Clinton in November.
0.0	0.2728074958	You want one?
0.0	0.272816642085	We need radical changes in mental health in America so somebody who is suicidal or homicidal can get the emergency care they need.
0.0	0.273030525604	It's not just about getting rid of a single dictator.
0.0	0.273510122135	But this cannot be an American fight, although American leadership is essential.
0.0	0.273731405246	Let me do that but let me pick up on an issue, a very important issue that we have not yet discussed.
0.0	0.274383140904	And for the sake of our economy, they must -- the major banks must be broken up.
0.0	0.274591775838	We must anticipate these threats before they happen.
0.0	0.275097593124	It's what happened in Governor O'Malley's state.
0.0	0.275620369593	I wish he was here.
0.0	0.276417144775	Sit down with people like John Mccain.
0.0	0.27644845252	Well, John, let me concur with you and with all Americans who are shocked and disgusted by what we saw in Paris yesterday.
0.0	0.276943537108	I said, "how's it going?"
0.0	0.277482829017	Let me just...
0.0	0.277482829017	Let me just...
0.0	0.277908799049	That's what it is.
0.0	0.278110516977	I think more of it is coming and it's going to grow.
0.0	0.279083950728	Disparaging women, disparaging hispanics, that's not a sign of strength.
0.0	0.279106934097	That makes no sense at all.
0.0	0.279280520791	And then, of course, 9/11 happened, which happened before there was an invasion of Iraq.
0.0	0.27976015894	(APPLAUSE)
0.0	0.279926208477	And as it relates to all the other organizations, let me give you a good example.
0.0	0.280418040846	And Dulce Candy -- a pretty cool name, actually -- that is now an entrepreneur over Youtube is part of that American spirit, and we should celebrate it as conservatives.
0.0	0.280428452744	But I did want to -- I wanted to follow up.
0.0	0.280570551913	That's why as commander in chief, I will take on ISIS, not only because it keeps us safe, but because it allows us to absolutely conduct our religious affairs the way we find in our heart and in our souls.
0.0	0.280899590589	I think we ought to give Ukraine offensive weapons and I think we ought to fight them on the economic basis because Putin is a one- horse country: oil and energy.
0.0	0.281116906897	And I believe only with a strong America will we defeat this radical group, this apocalyptic group called ISIS.
0.0	0.281320641834	How has it worked?
0.0	0.281678969005	He's not arming the Kurds.
0.0	0.281861876727	And they have a desire not simply to conquer the Middle East and to become the dominant power in that region, but ultimately to be able to hold America hostage.
0.0	0.282170238812	We need much more than that.
0.0	0.282188805224	And that's why Monday night, what will happen here in Iowa is so important.
0.0	0.282459463413	It was our money, and we brought them back to tend to the mentally ill. Because I don't think they ought to live in prison or live under a bridge; to treat the drug-addicted so they're not in an in-and-out-of- the-door policy out of the prisons; and to help the working poor so they don't live in emergency rooms.
0.0	0.282704821754	I am the son and grandson of immigrants.
0.0	0.282998559763	With all -- with all due respect...
0.0	0.283157678296	They are going to have to take on ISIS.
0.0	0.283624530332	In terms of my faith, look, all I say is that when I study scripture, I know that people who live in the shadows need to have a chance.
0.0	0.283828181442	Well, let me just say something.
0.0	0.285563356612	Here's the story.
0.0	0.286050852027	Let me put those proposals-- and you're absolutely right.
0.0	0.286473580917	It cannot solely be America's fight.
0.0	0.28722202261	And so I think really that vote is going to stay in the Paul household.
0.0	0.287461487965	Might I respond?
0.0	0.28818376747	Your name wasn't mentioned, Ted.
0.0	0.288542723306	I intend to do the exact same thing to defeat radical Islamic terrorism --
0.0	0.288660388076	I don't think Ted can have it both ways.
0.0	0.288725690307	Can I -- can I -- I just...
0.0	0.288781226159	And let me tell you what the answer better not be.
0.0	0.289058031331	So, your original question is the right question.
0.0	0.28919235543	She's not the threat.
0.0	0.289513629487	He's an entertaining guy.
0.0	0.289684545721	We can re-assume our role in the world.
0.0	0.289880656475	And I will go back and say again, AIG was not a big bank.
0.0	0.290488508013	We need to focus our energies there, not these broad, blanket, kind of statements that will make it harder for us to deal with ISIS.
0.0	0.291604338649	It is enormously complicated.
0.0	0.291855670353	And to contrast, even -- there are differences among us.
0.0	0.292241125979	Kathie, let me say this.
0.0	0.292280451084	I want those kids to know that if they study hard, they do their homework, regardless of the income of their families, they will in fact be able to get a college education because we are going to make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.29260931579	I guess I'm part of the establishment Barbara Bush is my mom.
0.0	0.292671471798	Bigger than that?
0.0	0.292811471071	You will have welcomed my dad to preach at your churches.
0.0	0.293323090997	... Chris, keep it coming...
0.0	0.293335060769	Here's what I'd do.
0.0	0.293741259187	We need a leader that will fix things and have a proven record to do it.
0.0	0.294017805597	I have been tried under many different emergencies and I can tell you that in each of those emergencies, whether they were inflicted by drug gangs, whether they were natural emergencies, I knew how to lead and I knew how to govern because I know how to manage people in a crisis and be very clear about the goal of protecting human life.
0.0	0.295054128129	I also think the war on drugs has disproportionately affected our African-American community, and what we need to do is make sure that the war on drugs is equal protection under the law and that we don't unfairly incarcerate another generation of young African-American males.
0.0	0.295204574597	And then he cut and run because it wasn't popular amongst conservatives, I guess.
0.0	0.295370685876	And those countries who are opposed to Islam, they are going to have to get deeply involved in a way that is not the case today.
0.0	0.295519969507	They've been talking about this issue for 30 years, and nothing ever happens.
0.0	0.29560687591	They would like to rip it up and start all over again, throw our nation back into this really contentious debate that we've had about health care for quite some time now.
0.0	0.295624238334	That's who I'm indebted to.
0.0	0.295954113755	But I can tell you this.
0.0	0.296012415237	You see, ladies and gentlemen, at the end of the day, I'm an optimist
0.0	0.296732172878	We need to be doing military exercises if not only Estonia but Latvia and Lithuania.
0.0	0.296951988645	Because if your faith causes you to care for the less fortunate, it is something you want to see in your public figures.
0.0	0.2969579879	And number two, if we find out they're developing a nuclear weapon and we know how to get to it, we're gonna go take it out.
0.0	0.296992923052	John, this is another one of those examples.
0.0	0.297111440102	ISIS is a group that wants to trigger an apocalyptic showdown in the city of Dabiq -- not the city of Dubuque; I mis-said -- mis-said that wrong once (inaudible) time -- the city of Dabiq in Syria.
0.0	0.297176370131	And, I'll note finally, Chris, there is a reason that Iowa's Congressman Steve King, perhaps the fiercest defender of farmers in this state, is sharing my campaign.
0.0	0.297310502237	We will -- when I am president of the United States, on my first day in office, we are canceling the deal with Iran, and nations will have to make a choice.
0.0	0.297496353786	I think we need major reform in the military, making it more cost effective, but also focusing on the real crisis that faces us.
0.0	0.298160826841	...the only reason is -- look...
0.0	0.298235839715	You know, one of our biggest national security issues is the world looks at us some time, and we look at each other and say, why can't we solve problems?
0.0	0.298270821557	We have made some good progress.
0.0	0.298274942063	Please become part of the political revolution.
0.0	0.298411152324	It's hate action.
0.0	0.298466937795	Well, this is what I would say, and the Congressman was right.
0.0	0.298748340368	And I apologize to nobody for that.
0.0	0.299345320999	Anyone can go online at tedcruz.org and read exactly what it said.
0.0	0.300268421279	These are American soldiers and we fail them when we fail to take into account what happens the day after a dictator falls and when we fail to act with a whole of government approach with sustainable development, diplomacy, and our economic power in alignment with our principles.
0.0	0.300445065445	We can do that.
0.0	0.300445065445	You can do both.
0.0	0.300579367192	Here's what I believe.
0.0	0.301495970885	A debate actually is a policy issue, but I will say this.
0.0	0.301546078035	Let's be frank here.
0.0	0.301699231107	I believe we've got to go further.
0.0	0.301699546116	Megyn?
0.0	0.301910757321	Look, we have waiting lists for veterans that are -- that are leaving because of the sequester where we're gutting the military.
0.0	0.301921878183	That's right.
0.0	0.301921878183	That's right.
0.0	0.301921878183	That's right.
0.0	0.301972385949	So I've said, if the big banks don't play by the rules, I will break them up.
0.0	0.30338079412	You learn that threats always change.
0.0	0.303727438597	I believe it is a right.
0.0	0.303911716291	You've got to go the extra mile.
0.0	0.303973926739	It will not happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.303988933207	You know, the situation is this.
0.0	0.304171917943	I'm very much against the government being involved in every aspect of our lives, you know?
0.0	0.304371399887	Look, the conservative message is economic growth and along with economic growth goes opportunity for everybody in America.
0.0	0.304491104721	But all of this has to come together when we have a positive attitude, an optimistic approach, an ability for us to set the tune as conservatives, to invite other people in to be part of that orchestra.
0.0	0.304576879207	Sure, because there has been three different investigations and proven that I knew nothing.
0.0	0.30468600173	If I am elected president...
0.0	0.304763552849	They will never again support it, and that's wrong for our country, bad for our future.
0.0	0.304956481958	And I will also go after executives who are responsible for the decisions that have such bad consequences for our country.
0.0	0.30556751563	I think we need to put in some armored brigades there.
0.0	0.305607616642	I want to use pell grants to help defray the living expenses that often make a difference, whether a young person can stay in school or not.
0.0	0.305789855642	Absolutely.
0.0	0.305789855642	Absolutely.
0.0	0.305983541725	When I ran in Texas, I told the people of Texas, "if you elect me, I will lead the fight against amnesty."
0.0	0.306182898901	And I've had many situations in the state of Ohio where we've had to move, whether it's storms, whether it was a horrible school shooting.
0.0	0.306199762348	It's become more complicated.
0.0	0.306355675426	They do not want us to exercise religious liberty.
0.0	0.306720656881	And a mom of a service member of ours who served two duties in Iraq said, Governor O' Malley, please, when you're with your other candidates and colleagues on stage, please don't use the term 'boots on the ground'.
0.0	0.306987804692	We have so much natural gas now, and we can liquify it, and we can transfer it across the sea so we can make Europe dependent on us instead of Putin -- put him back in his little box where he belongs.
0.0	0.307129946773	In Houston, Texas, there's an organization in place because someone acted on their heart, wanted to make sure that there's no homeless veterans in Houston.
0.0	0.307197365086	Give people a chance.
0.0	0.307412346586	John, may I -- may I interject here?
0.0	0.30798477469	It's making...
0.0	0.308040244605	And I cannot wait to earn the opportunity to do it because she cannot be the president of the United States.
0.0	0.308203310678	So did you, Marco.
0.0	0.308525558473	But the differences among us pale compared to what's happening on the Republican side.
0.0	0.308602456174	And as our party's nominee, I will defeat Hillary Clinton in November.
0.0	0.308768478561	So it is difficult.
0.0	0.30905422122	If I'm elected president, we will repeal every word of Obamacare.
0.0	0.309162007885	Well, Megyn, let me say at the outset to the men and women of Iowa, thank you for the incredible hospitality over this past year.
0.0	0.309313469757	So I don't think you can paint with a broad brush.
0.0	0.30938343305	And second of all...
0.0	0.309496116431	We took out the safe haven in Afghanistan, but now there is, undoubtedly, a larger safe haven and we must rise to this occasion in collaboration and with alliances to confront it, and invest in the future much better human intelligence so we know what the next steps are.
0.0	0.309719254993	She's an American citizen.
0.0	0.309749466972	Let me just say this...
0.0	0.309917058789	So the fact is that we work for the people.
0.0	0.310050952261	Obviously, I believe that on a college campus, there should be enough respect so people hear each other.
0.0	0.310062012892	There is no challenge too great for the United States to confront, provided we have the ability and the courage to put forward new leadership that can move us to those better and safer and more prosperous days.
0.0	0.310262479777	Because they know that Hillary Clinton will never be prosecuted by this justice department, and they're going to want to put a former federal prosecutor on the stage to prosecute her next September.
0.0	0.310445805102	And ISIS, make no mistake about it, is an evil in this world.
0.0	0.310519791542	So, yes, I'd absolutely would go in if he attacked.
0.0	0.310958561113	I would say that on this issue, I'm a little bit more conservative than the Secretary...
0.0	0.311549082022	You take a look at the -- at Belgium.
0.0	0.311638494503	KELLY: Go ahead, Governor Christie.
0.0	0.311654149747	Well, I think it's pretty clear that they know that I will.
0.0	0.312722811843	Senator Cruz, I'd like to respond...
0.0	0.312809903936	... First of all -- Let me go first, and then you can please recognize Rand after.
0.0	0.313367800126	Let's do more -- let's do more than reverse the immunity.
0.0	0.31341870505	But I would want to agree with something that Senator Sanders says.
0.0	0.313467603784	Look, I don't believe there's the model -- there's lots of good people that work in finance, Secretary Sanders, but Secretary Clinton, we need to step up and we need to protect Main Street from Wall Street and you can't do that by -- by campaigning as the candidate of Wall Street.
0.0	0.313579593105	If the American people see us granting amnesty they will never again believe in legal immigration.
0.0	0.313627217653	We can create a situation where wages begin to rise.
0.0	0.313857747137	You've got to work with local communities and you've got to work with the federal government.
0.0	0.314254860488	The Secretary's obviously right.
0.0	0.314473576055	That is abundantly clear.
0.0	0.314967898434	Make ourselves stronger at home, but also our role in the world, yes, is also to confront evil when it rises.
0.0	0.315162794707	I don't think the United States should be engaged in symbolic military activity.
0.0	0.315259669363	They like to ask direct questions.
0.0	0.315313441177	(APPLAUSE) I think that is the -- I think that's the conservative consensus pragmatic approach to how to solve this problem.
0.0	0.315355527102	And when I'm president, we are going to bring it under control once and for all after 30 years of talking about it.
0.0	0.315448010118	That's what we believe in.
0.0	0.315737850631	As I said before, we are a land of immigrants, but we have to be intelligent about the way that we form our immigration policies, and that's one of the reasons that I have called on us to declare war on the Islamic State because we need to reorient our immigration policies and our visa policies for people who are coming into this country because there are many people out there who want to destroy us.
0.0	0.315752576555	Look, I served on...
0.0	0.316042562814	I am certainly, absolutely, willing to look at that bill again and make sure there's a stronger bill.
0.0	0.316876842729	We ought to be working to improve it and prevent Republicans from both underming it and even repealing it.
0.0	0.31689772201	If the proponents of this bill actually demonstrate a commitment not to politics, not to campaigning all the time, but to actually fixing this problem, to finding a middle ground.
0.0	0.316919022769	And I would -- first of all, face him down in that whole region, the whole Baltic region.
0.0	0.316922138779	To get the information from Hillary Clinton, you need to get a subpoena from the FBI.
0.0	0.317035699383	Our role in the world is to make ourselves a beacon of hope.
0.0	0.317768568055	I -- I believe that we should make community college free.
0.0	0.317783705069	Well, I'm sorry that whoever tweeted that had that impression because I worked closely with New Yorkers after 9/11 for my entire first term to rebuild.
0.0	0.31790226174	I think issues and substance, policy and vision and record should be the meat of politics.
0.0	0.317911545841	Barack Obama wants to change America.
0.0	0.318050716356	There's a lot packed into that statement.
0.0	0.318152522744	And I agree with much of what the Secretary and the Governor have said.
0.0	0.318763835533	Ted can change his mind.
0.0	0.319037806846	Well, I -- if I might.
0.0	0.31914892391	You know, Chris, here's what happened with Medicaid in my state.
0.0	0.319393919991	I can promise you.
0.0	0.319406260207	It's not going to happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.319570102936	The mentally ill?
0.0	0.319703364618	Just because this is not an esoteric argument.
0.0	0.319807715551	Go on to martinomalley.com.
0.0	0.320922159322	Now what we have to take on is the pharmaceutical industry that is ripping off the American people every single day.
0.0	0.321256309213	You can change your mind.
0.0	0.321345447088	And it is a fact that the net immigration from Mexico and South has basically zeroed out.
0.0	0.321715067543	That's basically bordering on a miracle because of our great prison director.
0.0	0.321962870511	And I also have detailed plans to fix the mess in Washington, D.C.
0.0	0.322592323789	I am glad Donald is running.
0.0	0.322731564497	You know, what people are frustrated about in Washington, D.C.., and I know the folks out there tonight are incredibly frustrated because what they see is a government that doesn't work for them.
0.0	0.322777765329	I couldn't talk to anybody about it.
0.0	0.322829821285	We will see what the American people are willing to support.
0.0	0.323137280455	We only have one or two.
0.0	0.3231429635	We must keep America safe from this threat.
0.0	0.32319806787	And I was there when we went into the Gulf War.
0.0	0.323205862052	That's the kind of leadership this country needs.
0.0	0.323301624247	They're terrified by the saber rattling.
0.0	0.324539981695	And I had to confront the possibility of being a single parent.
0.0	0.32563525858	Both.
0.0	0.32563525858	No.
0.0	0.32563525858	No.
0.0	0.32563525858	No.
0.0	0.326148571786	We don't want to be like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.326222296225	We need a strategy to destroy ISIS there.
0.0	0.326352597897	And my effort in introducing them was to find a solution that reflected common ground and that fixed the problem.
0.0	0.326676521601	...and that do not allow us to pursue victory.
0.0	0.326881138583	I saw Reagan do it, I've seen other presidents do it.
0.0	0.327023990715	But I would say that if you want to defend the country, it begins with border security.
0.0	0.327150632206	And we ought to fight them on that level.
0.0	0.327166236186	Come on now.
0.0	0.327949860405	This is about the bigger, broader war against ISIS.
0.0	0.328300300467	And it is from the lessons from history that we do this because if we allow this to fester, we're going to have Islamic terrorism, multi-generations of it all across this country.
0.0	0.328541002704	And Teddy Roosevelt is right.
0.0	0.329324287247	Well, John, I think that we have to look at ISIS as the leading threat of an international terror network.
0.0	0.329725915764	And this is why you need to send someone from outside of Washington to Washington.
0.0	0.329746901658	Each one of them, you know, described their child, had a picture.
0.0	0.330176367366	My son is not a pair of boots on the ground.
0.0	0.330243580584	You know, I think abortion is always wrong.
0.0	0.33024573188	We've got to have them be part of our coalition.
0.0	0.330271048992	But what is particularly insulting, though, is that he is the king of saying, "you're for amnesty."
0.0	0.330354234862	And I do not believe it's a good idea now.
0.0	0.33035477045	Well, I mean, I was talked about in the question.
0.0	0.330516292374	I'd suggest people take a look at it.
0.0	0.330825647672	If you stack that up it would be a three-story building.
0.0	0.331056805428	It was...
1.0	0.331125061018	I have not insulted Donald personally and I don't intend to.
0.0	0.332000186141	They've been stepped on for too long in this society, and we are beginning to treat them.
0.0	0.332182990641	And what we said is, if they're going to impose this on us, we better prepare to protect the state from it.
0.0	0.332348026205	So there might be an occasion if we did overturn Roe v. Wade -- Roe v. Wade nationalized the issue.
0.0	0.332409544717	If Teddy Roosevelt, a good Republican, were alive today, you know what he'd say?
0.0	0.332794366339	Millions of people are going to have to stand up, turn off the TV, get involved in the political process and tell the big- money interest that we are taking back our country.
0.0	0.332939405683	I said we should go to 65, but only if we have as careful a screening and vetting process as we can imagine, whatever resources it takes because I do not want us to, in any way, inadvertently allow people who wish us harm to come into our country.
0.0	0.333359816164	You've heard some of those tonight.
0.0	0.333492010515	It's an important one that we should be engaged in.
0.0	0.333867201028	Now I want to go back something.
0.0	0.334133560961	No, I have not.
0.0	0.334969950382	It's not true.
0.0	0.334992185709	We've been struggling to get this done since Harry Truman.
0.0	0.335032947968	I think THAT you can talk about Islamists who clearly are also jihadists, but I think it's not particularly helpful to make the case that Senator Sanders was just making that I agree with, that we've got to reach out to Muslim countries.
0.0	0.335360922967	You've got to be on top of it.
0.0	0.335366772596	It should follow the principles of expanding competition, empowering patients, and keeping government from getting in between us and our doctors.
0.0	0.335867207612	And the thing is, she can't be a champion of women's rights at the same time she's got this that is always lurking out there, this type of behavior.
0.0	0.335958299728	There is no question in my mind that if we summon our resources, both our leadership resources and all of the tools at our disposal, not just military force, which should be used as a last resort, but our diplomacy, our development aid, law enforcement, sharing of intelligence in a much more open and cooperative way -- that we can bring people together.
0.0	0.33628969646	Kevin, if I could just jump in.
0.0	0.3364111778	The people don't work for us.
0.0	0.336464832797	And now mom and dad can stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.
0.0	0.336964759846	Everybody's for amnesty except for Ted Cruz.
0.0	0.337712193614	It is the future of the world and the future of our children and grandchildren.
0.0	0.337876516632	And I was clear about that at the time.
0.0	0.338085373732	So, yes, I did know people.
0.0	0.338178878718	I think we all support it.
0.0	0.338197170172	Now I am the only candidate up here that doesn't have a super PAC.
0.0	0.338228237689	He believes everything he stands for.
0.0	0.33899670619	And so, you go the extra mile.
0.0	0.339334790354	Now, in fact, what we have got to do -- and I think there is widespread agreement here -- is the United States cannot do it alone.
0.0	0.339602210371	Everybody ought to have a chance to be able to rise to their God-given purpose.
0.0	0.339872757899	She did.
0.0	0.340113659972	I believe calling it what it is, is to say radical jihadis.
0.0	0.340202064115	I'm running for president, because as I go around this nation, I talk to a lot of people.
0.0	0.341009956803	And especially what these programs are asking us to pass that will do nothing to help the environment, but will be devastating for our economy.
0.0	0.341084821906	She worked -- and many of us supported you -- in trying to rebuild that devastation.
0.0	0.341365324844	The problem is, this redistribution has gone in the wrong direction.
0.0	0.342568382362	I respectfully disagree with Senator Sander's approach.
0.0	0.343066597446	There was a lot of activism on campus -- Civil Rights activism, antiwar activism, women's rights activism -- and I do appreciate the way young people are standing up and speaking out.
0.0	0.3430799714	You're seeing cities like Seattle.
0.0	0.343413671789	I think on Article V of NATO, we would definitely protect all of our allies.
0.0	0.343590117971	We have a lot of work to do, to better prepare our nation and to better lead this world into this new century.
0.0	0.343656827378	No, they shouldn't.
0.0	0.34379029487	And that's the only way we'll ever balance our budget.
0.0	0.343889309028	May I respond?
0.0	0.343889309028	May I respond?
0.0	0.344563673216	They need to be defeated militarily, and that will take overwhelming U.S. force.
1.0	0.345340118736	It absolutely has been, and at the time in the context of that was in 2009, and 2010, where the last effort for legalization was an effort done in the Senate.
0.0	0.345562882223	America is best when we are actually standing up to evil in this world.
0.0	0.345922694785	But, I don't believe that Washington should be picking winners and losers.
0.0	0.346050806087	And I think that's a bad idea for the following reason.
0.0	0.346581904308	No, because if you look at the quote, and it's very specific.
0.0	0.346633239864	You know, Ted didn't show up.
0.0	0.346662048624	But the truth of the matter is, if we want wages to go up, we've got to get 11 million of our neighbors out of off the book shadow economy, and into the full light of an American economy.
0.0	0.346746427461	I will make sure that we fire the sheer incompetence inside the Department of Veterans Affairs and then we'll give veterans a choice card so that they don't have to travel hours and hours to get care if they want to go to their private provider.
0.0	0.347281636958	I don't want immigration reform to fail.
0.0	0.347287461423	You read about all the companies now that are doing business -- about to do business in Iran, and if we don't get this settled now, with other countries in the world, about sanctions, then Iran could violate that agreement, and we're the only ones putting the sanctions on.
0.0	0.347397417971	I looked at ways that the shareholders would have more control over what was going on in that arena.
0.0	0.34741908404	But I want to say a quick word about what Senator Sanders and then Governor O'Malley said.
0.0	0.347503541202	The endorsements that I am proud of are leading conservatives like Iowa's own Congressman Steve King, who is a national co-chairman of my campaign.
0.0	0.347795454372	This group needs to be confronted and defeated.
0.0	0.347925666297	And I give Senator Sanders a lot of credit for really lighting a fire under many people -- young, old, everybody -- who sees a chance to be involved and have their voice heard.
0.0	0.348589719021	He's a progressive economist.
0.0	0.348702906325	It's not about Donald Trump.
0.0	0.348909709915	And if we do those things, we can be a country that actually can afford debt-free college again.
0.0	0.34906337918	... against Islam -- radical Islam -- if you're not for border security.
0.0	0.3491256376	I've always listened to you, Megyn.
0.0	0.349294835453	So we have a lot of work to do to get jobs going again, get incomes rising again.
0.0	0.349676483644	Let's don't use the term 'boots on the ground'.
0.0	0.34979776007	But the fact is, every single engine of government has to move when you see a crisis like that.
0.0	0.349814984914	Our identity is not based on race or ethnicity, it's based on a set of shared values.
0.0	0.350217101919	He was the only Republican that didn't show up for it.
0.0	0.350354972126	... and that's what you and others can start providing in the Senate.
0.0	0.350852789316	But, you know, we are blessed with tremendous energy in this nation, and we need to be looking for new sources of energy.
0.0	0.350990808919	And that's what we need to be doing to the best of our ability in our country.
0.0	0.351003338217	It's saved a lot of lives along the way, Senator.
0.0	0.351083289149	Marco can change his mind.
0.0	0.351144673751	I think it ought to be a compact -- families contribute, kids contribute.
0.0	0.351587497828	What is important to understand is we have organizations, whether it is ISIS or Al Qaida, who do believe we should go back several thousand years.
0.0	0.351611289116	It was against Assad.
0.0	0.351669313615	Are they going to stand with us against this kind of jihadi radicalism or not?
0.0	0.351824155946	They don't believe in any of that.
0.0	0.352023558933	And I am the one true fiscal conservative who will look at all spending.
0.0	0.352101087473	The central question in this race is trust.
0.0	0.352216969714	... Chris, your questions that you...
0.0	0.352334288552	... Well, no, no.
0.0	0.352502718946	They have children who are doing so well, I've met and worked with dreamers.
0.0	0.352555801591	This is a war for the soul of Islam.
0.0	0.352576144322	We'll have mandatory E-verify, a mandatory entry/exit tracking system and until all of that is in place and all of that is working and we can prove to the people of this country that illegal immigration is under control, nothing else is going to happen.
0.0	0.352665784659	And, here's what she said to the American people.
0.0	0.352861738976	So I believe that, in fact, this country needs to move towards a living wage.
0.0	0.353015966859	All right, Nancy, I really wish you'd come back to me on this on this one, John...
0.0	0.353114574226	So did you.
0.0	0.353374839231	... first of all, I'm -- don't worry, I'm not leaving the stage no matter what you ask me.
0.0	0.353396100117	The American people are terrified.
0.0	0.353402124591	And here's the problem with what's going on around the world.
0.0	0.353502536953	The NSA is another big issue.
0.0	0.353633941666	Chris I was mentioned in that question.
0.0	0.353697574855	And we have to stop all the divisions.
0.0	0.35384301149	And it was not only a great accomplishment of the Democratic Party, but of President Obama.
0.0	0.353883213896	It's also about choosing our next commander-in-chief.
0.0	0.35388408776	Well, thank you very much to CBS and everyone here this evening for giving us another chance to appear before you.
0.0	0.354537531184	Someone who has a proven record, who has been tested, who is totally transparent.
0.0	0.354564939295	But when millions of people stand up and are prepared to take on the insurance companies and the drug companies, it will happen, and I will lead that effort.
0.0	0.354824429809	We think we're going to do very well in Iowa with the liberty vote.
0.0	0.355176966111	Yeah (ph), no, I think that's a -- that's a huge mistake, to be closing down mosques.
0.0	0.355347370843	We desperately need a conservative leader as president of the United States.
0.0	0.355422262758	He can't have it both ways.
0.0	0.355559505061	... Actually, I was...
0.0	0.355758537257	They elected moderate leaders.
0.0	0.355848140404	And if we capture any of these ISIS killers alive, they are going to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we're going to find out everything they know, because when I'm president, unlike Barack Obama, we will keep this country safe.
0.0	0.355984453406	There are many crises that come -- a water crisis in Toledo.
0.0	0.35653271124	... first of all...
0.0	0.35667229185	And it has been amazing to me.
0.0	0.356834887253	I think it's important for people in elected office to try to forge consensus to solve problems.
0.0	0.356943678316	ISIS has now attacked a western democracy in -- in France.
0.0	0.357058164933	... there was a question about foreign policy, by the way, and experience.
0.0	0.357386696893	You know, for the 45-year-old construction worker out there, who is having a hard time making things meet.
0.0	0.357622712615	So, in terms of refugees, I believe that the United States has the moral responsibility with Europe, with Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia to make sure that when people leave countries like Afghanistan and Syria with nothing more than the clothing on their back that, of course, we reach out.
0.0	0.357673716479	It's perfectly legal in this country to change your mind.
0.0	0.357681870405	They want everyone in this country to follow their religious beliefs the way they do.
0.0	0.357736107345	Gosh, if you guys ask one more mean question I may have to leave the stage.
0.0	0.357965914125	Look, I am in the establishment because my dad, the greatest man alive was president of the United States and my brother, who I adore as well as fantastic brother was president.
0.0	0.358406554265	And then, with the revolution against Assad -- and I did early on say we needed to try to find a way to train and equip moderates very early so that we would have a better idea of how to deal with Assad because I thought there would be extremist groups filling the vacuum.
0.0	0.358676025737	And there's all sorts of ways that can be done at the state, local and federal level to do that.
0.0	0.358695791992	I have -- look, I would agree with much of what Senator Sanders says, Kevin.
0.0	0.359093755777	We're worried the future of our children and we've have been burned over and over again.
0.0	0.359110431859	If I was a Puerto Rican, I'd vote for statehood so that they have full citizenship.
0.0	0.359321648995	I think she said something like the bulk of the responsibility is not ours.
0.0	0.359589331519	We have problems with Russia.
0.0	0.359682259056	That's what we need to do as a nation.
0.0	0.359999840129	So, I think it's important for us to be careful about the language we use, which is why I've been critical of Donald Trump.
0.0	0.360106506764	And, yes, we are at war with those people.
1.0	0.360111089082	They knew that they were talking about trying to take our country and attack it.
0.0	0.360938016761	He views himself not simply as the leader of Iran, but as the leader of all Muslims -- all Shia Muslims on the planet.
0.0	0.361313184255	They would -- they would accept the responsibilities of full U.S. citizenship.
0.0	0.361781444677	Iraq is a mess.
0.0	0.362660920928	It certainly does cover it.
0.0	0.362700811424	Well first of all, I think it's important that when we're running for the highest office in the land that we recognize that we're living in dangerous times and we have to be serious about it, that our words have consequences.
0.0	0.363197625585	If you believe that our country's problems and the threats that we face in this world can only be met with new thinking, new and fresh approaches, then I ask you to join my campaign.
0.0	0.363303764278	So if Ms. Davis wanted to step aside and get rid of her ability to be able to do that, there should be someone else in that office who it didn't violate their conscience so they could follow the law of the state of Kentucky.
0.0	0.364138613095	And I will pay for it by, yes, taxing the wealthy more, closing corporate loopholes, deductions, and other kinds of favorable treatment.
0.0	0.364324544929	I believe that the goal should be debt-free college.
0.0	0.364696030647	And I'll tell you the endorsements that I am proud of are the over 200,000 volunteers across this country who have signed up to volunteer for our campaign.
0.0	0.36470756829	When I am president of the United States of America, there will never be any cap-and-trade in the United States.
0.0	0.364878132777	That's crony capitalism.
0.0	0.364879858567	I don't think she's responsible for his behavior.
0.0	0.365425946139	She should not feel uncomfortable about her citizenship.
0.0	0.365740478552	Who do you know will kill the terrorists, defend the constitution and repeal Obamacare?
0.0	0.365796012565	Here's my promise-- Wall Street representatives will not be in my cabinet.
0.0	0.365846309019	It is because in this nation, we are influenced by Judeo-Christian values that teach us to care for the less fortunate, to reach out to the needy, to love our neighbor.
0.0	0.366018776332	If not, they can stay where they are.
0.0	0.366449888982	But you've just asked a very fundamental question about the role of faith in our country.
0.0	0.366582445028	You know, it is difficult finding intelligence that is actionable in a lot of these places, but we have to keep trying.
0.0	0.366720632241	It's what they call it.
0.0	0.36677881573	See, I was there when Reagan rebuilt the military.
0.0	0.367358767885	And that someone in that office has to do their job.
0.0	0.367512988981	First of all...
0.0	0.367512988981	First of all...
0.0	0.367544770493	We've got challenges in the South China Sea because of what China is doing in building up these military installations.
0.0	0.367637229731	... and to devote the resources from the booming economy to rebuilding our Navy, rebuilding our Air Force, rebuilding our Army and ensuring we have the capacity to keep this country safe.
0.0	0.36768132645	So, you know, it's fine for you to say what you're going to say, but I looked very carefully at your proposal.
0.0	0.367921867448	It is about understanding the secondary and third consequences that fall next.
0.0	0.368018432828	All of us want equal pay for equal work.
0.0	0.368132039452	But it's a lot safer.
0.0	0.368790177589	I have nothing against the passion that my two friends here have about reinstating Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.368971418332	We need to move aggressively now.
0.0	0.36913103731	It is a different, fundamental military strategy than what we've seen from Barack Obama.
0.0	0.369135543741	Well, I think that there are different records.
0.0	0.369224002352	(inaudible).
0.0	0.369334937784	If I'm our nominee, I will unite this party and we'll defeat Hillary Clinton and we will turn this country around once and for all, after seven years of the disaster that is Barack Obama.
0.0	0.370323383314	Get the lawyers off the damn backs of the military once and for all.
0.0	0.371590196533	And the people I have been accountable to every single day in the Senate are the 27 million Texans who I represent and I made a promise to them that I make to you today, which is, if I am elected, every single day I will do two things: tell the truth, and do what I said I would do.
0.0	0.372121400738	We want to destroy ISIS, it has to be in the air and on the ground.
0.0	0.372346062528	Let me tell you who's not qualified to be President of the United States, Chris.
0.0	0.372567718086	We cannot let things get farther down the road, like we did with North Korea.
0.0	0.37263520812	Washington is broken.
0.0	0.372711904645	You know, we all have our own individual interpretations of our faith.
0.0	0.37307269249	At the time, the liberal governor of Florida, who claimed he was a Republican -- his name was Charlie Crist -- he wanted to impose cap-and-trade on Florida.
0.0	0.373491788416	And the reason is, is that I've been a reformer all of my career, fighting to reform welfare, fighting to reform the Pentagon, also being in a position to balance the budget, because that is very, very hard to do.
0.0	0.373624923894	And that's the way it is.
0.0	0.374532973505	There was nobody to talk to and it really did give me an insight into the very difficult problems presidents face.
0.0	0.375383887616	As Americans, we have shown ourselves to have the greatest military on the face of the planet, but we are not so very good at anticipating threats and appreciating just how difficult it is to build up stable democracies, to make the investments and sustainable development that we must as a nation if we are to attack the root causes of these sorts of instability.
0.0	0.375524709783	No, you weren't.
0.0	0.37566413254	They are doing everything they can to prevent the voices of Americans to be heard.
0.0	0.37568179362	But bottom line now, is in America, in the year 2015, any person who has the ability and the desire should be able to get an education, college education, regardless of the income of his or her family.
0.0	0.376344814545	I want to thank the people of Iowa for being so welcoming to me.
0.0	0.37647181015	We should be supportive of that effort.
0.0	0.376535620311	And I -- I thought, if I didn't jump in, I might not be able to tell everybody this.
0.0	0.376687168395	This is the new sort of challenge, the new sort of threat that does, in fact, require new thinking, fresh approaches and new leadership.
0.0	0.376997049237	Like we have a -- we have a lot of work to do and we're the only nation on the planet that buries as many of our people from gun violence as we do.
0.0	0.37749878388	We can have debt-free college in the United States.
0.0	0.377983301256	And we need to be focused and lift the rules of engagement so we're not sending our fighting men and women into combat with their arms tied behind their backs.
0.0	0.378035675282	There are other ways to lead and to be a moral leader in this world, rather than at the opposite end of a drone strike.
0.0	0.378191419467	And we didn't put a single boot on the ground, and Gaddafi was deposed.
0.0	0.378217328058	And I think that's the false choice...
0.0	0.378607631425	And I'll tell you, Bret, I think that's a much more attractive vision for healthcare than the Washington-drive, top-down Obamacare that is causing so many millions of people to hurt.
1.0	0.378645918962	It didn't say a word about legalization.
0.0	0.378738242075	And I had commitments to be at a town hall in New Hampshire.
0.0	0.378788038214	... And that I am not a great fan of regime change.
0.0	0.379375088468	Our government belongs to all of us, and not just the hand full of billionaires.
0.0	0.38005921754	Number one, if they violate it, we need to move against them.
0.0	0.380274015652	We actually did it.
0.0	0.380304079614	I was sick and tired of Hillary Clinton's e-mail.
0.0	0.380521049767	They knew that.
0.0	0.380865103498	I still want to get back to health care, because I think that's a worthy topic to explore.
0.0	0.381290945712	You can't be in favor of defend us...
0.0	0.381800252092	Making fun of disabled people...
0.0	0.382486521859	You see something that's suspicious, you call law enforcement and let law enforcement make those decisions.
0.0	0.382547739756	But, of course, international terrorism is a major issue that we have got to address today.
0.0	0.383230371376	They would have to pay federal taxes.
0.0	0.38422957719	Let me just add to that.
0.0	0.384580040373	And this is where I've had my disagreement with Senator Rubio.
0.0	0.384797628789	The Libyans turned out for one of the most successful, fairest elections that any Arab country has had.
0.0	0.385135214358	I think the other problem is we have a legal immigration system that's outdated, it's primarily based on whether you have family members living here.
0.0	0.385187080153	The Turks are being threatened.
0.0	0.385187372208	When he ran for election in the state of Florida, he told the people of Florida, "if you elect me, I will lead the fight against amnesty."
0.0	0.38564660361	That would be a disaster for this country.
0.0	0.386100614912	And Megyn, it's best not to talk anymore about back doors and encryption, it will get solved, but it needs to be solved in the situation of the White House with the technology folks.
0.0	0.386159555945	And the bottom line is this, we are not going to be able to do anything on this issue until we first bring illegal immigration under control.
0.0	0.386190986856	Look, we don't know what's going to happen in ten months.
0.0	0.386236813884	Well, look the Joint Terrorism Task Force needs resources and tools.
0.0	0.386512468776	This is not a conflict where we send in the third divisions of Marines.
0.0	0.386775070518	Lehman Brothers was not a big bank.
0.0	0.387543217382	That's American citizenship.
0.0	0.387642191766	The formula is working.
0.0	0.388048938179	And a rebuilt U.S. military is going to destroy these terrorists.
0.0	0.388071296397	It's interesting that Jeb mentions the book.
0.0	0.388326960323	It's because I've been assembling a team of people who want to be involved in something that's a little bigger than themselves.
0.0	0.388354060486	If you're living on the edge of poverty and you get a $100 fine or your car towed, a lot of times you lose your job.
0.0	0.388386231489	Well, I've got news for you, we can.
0.0	0.388613895345	There has to be real tax reform, and the wealthiest and large corporations will pay when I'm president.
0.0	0.388914996496	And the issue is, the problem is, the front pages every day were dealing with it.
0.0	0.389111873509	It became popular after the attack in Paris, and San Bernardino.
0.0	0.389492224589	So, I think we've got to understand the complexity of the world that we are facing and no place is more so than in the Middle East.
0.0	0.389574821415	You know, you claim it is tough talk to discuss carpet bombing.
1.0	0.38973576451	The 500,000 who came home with PTSD, and traumatic brain injury.
0.0	0.38980278886	She is not qualified to be President of the United States.
0.0	0.390410397271	I just don't think it would get the job done.
0.0	0.391411615147	Because you realize that people depending on you.
1.0	0.391465660783	She wants to put Barack Obama on the Supreme Court of the United States of America.
0.0	0.391757559119	... We're never going to win elections if we don't have a more broader unifying message.
0.0	0.391891744849	Go ahead.
0.0	0.392229643441	It cannot be contained, it must be defeated.
0.0	0.392299692498	But we have to also be very clear that we do have some continuing challenges.
0.0	0.392361961303	But the thing that is most important to me and caused me to run for office is I'm worried about the country and how much debt we're adding.
0.0	0.392502941099	We are at the threshold of a new era of American progress, but it's going to require that we act as Americans, based on our principles, here at home, making an economy that works for all of us.
0.0	0.39311905292	ISIS is a group that burns people alive in cages; that sells off little girls as brides.
0.0	0.393249726902	A bipartisan approach got close.
0.0	0.39328477809	It is not a radical idea to say that if somebody works 40 hours a week, that person should not be living in poverty.
0.0	0.393786058867	But this election is not about our pedigree, this is an election about people that are really hurting.
0.0	0.393830432204	Teddy Roosevelt said, we are a nation of immigrants.
0.0	0.393998324811	We have to go after price gouging and monopolistic practices and get Medicare the authority to negotiate.
0.0	0.394239320033	Barack Obama wants America to be more like the rest of the world.
0.0	0.394924489626	I think Bernie Sanders is good candidate for president of Sweden.
0.0	0.394998375497	We are at war with violent extremism.
0.0	0.3955651694	I have said the invasion of Iraq was a mistake.
0.0	0.395723656383	... and we will end the illegal immigration.
0.0	0.396008827821	Our role in the world is not to roam the globe looking for new dictators to topple.
0.0	0.396415434024	And my reading of the law and the Constitution convinces me that the President has the authority that he is attempting to exercise with respect to dreamers and their parents, because I think all of us on this stage agree that we need comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.397326629804	And, also, acting according to our principles and constructing a new foreign policy of engagement and collaboration, and doing a much better job of identifying threats before they back up into military corners.
0.0	0.397519418614	And those are made up of the FBI, state and local law enforcement.
0.0	0.397586097986	I was there and I saw the debate.
0.0	0.398105462744	Now, there is a difference between personal insults and attacks -- between going into the mud with ad hominems and focusing on issues and substance.
0.0	0.398113367145	I've spent my entire life, since I started as a young lawyer for the Children's Defense Fund, trying to figure out how we can even the odds for so many people in America, this great country of ours, who are behind, who don't have a chance.
0.0	0.398579114003	We're giving young people and working people hope that real change can take place in America.
0.0	0.398724115694	I am still sick and tired of Hillary Clinton's e-mails.
0.0	0.398905396074	But I...
0.0	0.39914616973	We need different solutions to solve the problems and to save our nation.
0.0	0.399220721022	Look at what happened in '08, AIG, a big insurance company, Lehman Brothers, an investment bank helped to bring our economy down.
0.0	0.399470386478	We had all kinds of questions that we discussed and, you know, at the end, I recommended to the president that we take the chance to do what we could to find out whether that was bin Laden and to finally bring him to justice.
0.0	0.399598828859	Yes, I do believe there must be a tax on Wall Street speculation.
0.0	0.399664925443	She put America's secrets at risk for her convenience.
0.0	0.400038160581	For her convenience.
0.0	0.40004286024	That's a wonderful business model.
0.0	0.400141999091	It will be fly-to country.
0.0	0.400603458034	There's probably no person I respect more in the country or in recent history than my father.
0.0	0.400677753321	Well, let me be clear about one thing, there's only one savior and it's not me.
0.0	0.400951941748	I don't blame Hillary Clinton at all for this.
0.0	0.401349124533	In fact, if more border security and these -- and more and more deportations were going to bring our Republican brothers and sisters to the table, it would have happened long ago.
0.0	0.401467909883	Because most of the time, they're absolutely correct.
0.0	0.402114189428	Before you get to that, though, Puerto Rico is going to have to deal with the structural problems they face.
0.0	0.402224314388	Bernie Sanders is a socialist.
0.0	0.402810166504	My heart, like all of us in this room, John, and all the people across our country, my hearts go out to the people of France in this moment of loss.
1.0	0.402826445936	I have voted time and again to -- for -- for the background check, and I want to see it improved and expanded.
1.0	0.402868332871	He is the foremost expert in our country on the minimum wage, and what its effects are.
0.0	0.403008515194	We will finish the 700 miles of fencing and walls our nation needs.
0.0	0.403745396211	... and I think -- you know, Governor -- Jeb, you -- the attack that -- the authorization that Barack Obama asked for was not against ISIS.
0.0	0.403865411168	This is an emergency.
0.0	0.404130914559	They are our first line of defense.
0.0	0.405204129434	We also had attacks on two of our embassies in Tanzania, Kenya, when my husband was president.
0.0	0.405501001932	It ain't complicated.
0.0	0.405869060922	I think he was probably the most honest man in politics that we've ever seen in a generation.
0.0	0.405981237743	She put American strategy at risk for her convenience.
0.0	0.406253023842	But when you didn't do that and you ask people to support, you shouldn't cut and run.
0.0	0.406894993006	That's just media stuff.
0.0	0.407020877894	and in 2007 it almost passed when my brother was president of the United States.
0.0	0.407055999293	We saw that in Egypt.
0.0	0.407113899102	And I -- I supported him because I think people, when you're elected, you need to do things.
0.0	0.407246589803	That's how I focused from the beginning of the campaign and it is how I intend to continue going forward.
0.0	0.407631606982	I believe that actually affordable college, debt-free college is the goal that we need to attain as a nation.
0.0	0.40864861675	Or a young woman who had been performing at President Obama's second inauguration coming home, absolutely stellar young woman, hanging out with her friends in a park getting shot by a gang member.
0.0	0.408709828905	They knew they were talking about the issues of attacking people, Megyn.
0.0	0.408887680399	Why don't we let the process work.
0.0	0.408920127056	I want immigration reform to pass.
0.0	0.409011079132	That can be done without profiling people.
0.0	0.409609470304	But if you place good ones, you pocket it.
0.0	0.409749504972	You're not going to be able to ram down the throat of the American people your approach.
0.0	0.411224774266	That was a terrible mistake.
0.0	0.411282618293	And anyone who lies to the families of Americans who have died in the service of this country can never be commander-in-chief of the United States.
0.0	0.411430864515	When we put money into the hands of working people, they're going to go out and buy goods, they're going to buy services and they're going to create jobs in doing that.
0.0	0.411557287499	You see, we usually elect presidents in America that want to change the things that are wrong in America.
0.0	0.41163097822	I would want us to take our place among the nations of the world to alleviate this sort of death and the specter we saw of little kids' bodies washing up on a beach.
0.0	0.41176121677	What I would like for the media now is for us to be talking about why the middle class is disappearing, why we have more people in jail than any other country, why we have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, and we're the only major country on Earth without paid family and medical leave.
0.0	0.412389738399	In terms of Wall Street, I respectfully disagree with you, madam secretary, in the sense that the issue here is when you have such incredible power and such incredible wealth.
0.0	0.412549054358	All of us believe climate change is real.
0.0	0.412851648084	I disagree with free college for everybody.
0.0	0.413151873629	That's the difference, and that's the kind of leader we need in the White House.
0.0	0.413352050812	Paul Volcker, one of the leading lights of trying to reign in the excesses, has also said he does not support reinstating Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.413904155627	I don't know and with all due respect to the secretary, Wall Street played by the rules?
0.0	0.414124310205	I have made the decisions that need to be made as a governor to protect us and as president of the United States, no one will keep this country safer than I will.
0.0	0.414211429435	Border security has always been a part of that debate.
0.0	0.415195047691	In fact, sometimes it's not that way...
0.0	0.415217200178	They are not doing it now.
0.0	0.415791861051	We can create a situation for our children to be able to get a decent job to pay down their college debt.
0.0	0.416074598257	And it requires an entire world to come together, including in a very active way, the Muslim nations.
0.0	0.416165546437	They're not wrong.
0.0	0.416378763664	And the fact is, let law enforcement make those decisions.
0.0	0.416519134481	The first thing -- I don't know of anyone who's not in favor of fully vetting people that are trying to come into this country, other than perhaps Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.
0.0	0.416768219761	And, you know, that's been my message in New Hampshire.
0.0	0.416793525859	No, it would have to go through the Congress, and I know the White House has actually been working with members of Congress.
0.0	0.417751370561	But the first duty of the next president of the United States is to fix the mess at the Department of Veterans Affairs.
0.0	0.417963314443	And people at home are saying they've got a problem, listen to them.
0.0	0.418009150419	Well, I don't know about the GOP messaging, but I can tell you about my messaging.
0.0	0.418076507589	Number one, we're going to keep ISIS out of America.
0.0	0.41895261876	I'm an eye surgeon from Bowling Green, Kentucky, I miss doing eye surgery, still get to do a little bit.
0.0	0.419904360017	And the spiraling out-of- control requires Puerto Rico to make structural reforms.
0.0	0.420079978631	Well, our prayers are with the people of France tonight, but that is not enough.
0.0	0.420175491642	Well, thanks for having me.
0.0	0.420200366147	There's not going to be consensus on this issue until we enforce our immigration laws.
0.0	0.420484461677	Well, John, I come from the '60s, a long time ago.
0.0	0.421419623227	So, yes, this has developed.
0.0	0.421427507265	It better not be Bernie Sanders.
0.0	0.421740836458	Well, let me first describe Iran because they're not just a normal nation state.
0.0	0.42257118126	And who's compromised and who is principled.
0.0	0.42279716585	All of you in Iowa, I need you to caucus for me.
0.0	0.42323150221	And places like Seattle, like Los Angeles, like New York City, they can go higher.
0.0	0.423598318342	And I can do it without raising the debt, without raising taxes on the middle class and making it reasonably manageable within our budget so that we can be fiscally responsible at the same time.
0.0	0.424411858555	That's not fair.
0.0	0.42490364092	And I'll tell you who supported my amendment -- Jeff Sessions, the strongest opponent of amnesty in the United States Congress.
0.0	0.425181049886	So was I, John.
0.0	0.425922185234	I think after 11 hours, that's pretty clear, yes.
0.0	0.426065498192	We were proud of them on graduation day, but we're going to be proud every month for the rest of our natural lives.
0.0	0.426189829029	Here is the major issue when we talk about Wall Street.
0.0	0.426299868848	It is not a radical idea to say that a single mom should be earning enough money to take care of her kids.
0.0	0.426430592158	Never support.
0.0	0.426615276994	And then we saw that the leading candidates for president at the time, both the Republican and the Democrats, all supported it.
0.0	0.426748481216	The intelligence was by no means absolute.
0.0	0.427444183682	(LAUGHTER) Now that we've gotten the Donald Trump portion out of the way...
0.0	0.427577047862	You learn to create feedback mechanisms.
0.0	0.428230412015	I couldn't have said it better myself.
0.0	0.428935386591	And here's the problem in this country right now.
0.0	0.429144446224	Sit down with people like Jeff Miller, the Republican chairman of the house, and work on a bill.
0.0	0.429265951849	I...
0.0	0.429619487024	And, you know, I do think it's important to do exactly what Senator Sanders said, and that is to start talking about the issues that the American people really care about, and that they talk to each of us about.
0.0	0.429985108158	That's what the political revolution is about.
0.0	0.430911484996	I'm asking you for your vote.
0.0	0.430950522191	... that's the -- that's the false choice in this whole debate about immigration.
0.0	0.430974412705	This election is not only about electing a president.
0.0	0.431057650546	I think it's a big thing that our party needs to be part of, and I've been a leader in Congress on trying to bring about criminal justice reform.
0.0	0.431145327007	You can't do that without the cooperation of the Muslim world because they're as threatened as we are.
0.0	0.431205209931	CLINTON: Oh, wait a minute, senator.
0.0	0.43158707213	Now, once that is done, everyone agrees we need healthcare reform.
0.0	0.431587672926	Donald Trump, for example -- I'm glad -- I mentioned his name again just if anybody was missing him...
0.0	0.43177411871	Why do we continue to get ripped off by the drug companies who can charge us any prices they want?
0.0	0.432213705751	Have a no fly zone in Syria and create safe zones to deal with the refugees.
0.0	0.432651066143	Look, the threat we face from ISIS is unprecedented.
0.0	0.432890432048	I do not believe that we have to destroy our economy in order to protect our environment.
0.0	0.432891221061	But I just have to tell you that it's best with some of these things not be said.
0.0	0.432993766559	It means, come out from the shadows, pay a fine, earn legal status by working, by paying taxes, learning English.
0.0	0.433006412251	But I do think that her position as promoting women's rights and fairness to women in the workplace, that if what Bill Clinton did any CEO in our country did with an intern, with a 22-year- old, 21-year-old intern in their office, they would be fired.
0.0	0.433720574743	There's never going do be perfect bill.
0.0	0.434073070086	I would certainly tackle the cost issues, because I think that once the foundation was laid with a system to try to get as many people as possible into it, to end insurance discrimination against people with preexisting conditions or women, for example, that, yes, we were going to have to figure out how to get more competition in the insurance market, how to get the costs of -- particularly, prescription drugs, but other out-of-pocket expenses down.
0.0	0.434624301518	Our symbol is the Statue of Liberty.
0.0	0.434800323396	Well, because you can do it without profiling, Megyn, when you do it on the facts.
0.0	0.434949288043	If you place bad bets, the taxpayers bail you out.
0.0	0.435208033397	We have three children, eight, five and one.
0.0	0.435228372023	I'm not that much of a socialist compared to Eisenhower.
0.0	0.436054651339	Number two, we're going to enforce our immigration laws.
0.0	0.436547988048	So was Ted, but now he says it wasn't so.
0.0	0.43727690061	And, I think there should be no mandates, and no subsidies whatsoever.
0.0	0.438609495823	And that's what you expect from a leader.
0.0	0.438819478155	Got to be on the floor of the Senate.
0.0	0.439022744321	But at the end of the day, Wall Street today has enormous economic and political power.
0.0	0.439040539354	And Hillary Clinton lied to the families of those four brave Americans who lost their life in Benghazi.
0.0	0.439099153823	Well, that creates an environment that's toxic in our own country.
0.0	0.439320529122	... And start taking advice...
0.0	0.439453558202	I think the United States military is operating under rules of engagement that are too strict...
0.0	0.439547649327	Part of the problem that we have currently in the Middle East is that Assad has hung on to power with the very strong support of Russia and Iran and with the proxy of Hezbollah being there basically fighting his battles.
0.0	0.440186726678	And so, look, the way that -- a stronger middle class is actually the source of economic growth.
0.0	0.440424526757	The media noise will soon be over and it's now for the men and women of Iowa to decide.
0.0	0.441061961863	But I believe in the Teddy Roosevelt philosophy.
0.0	0.441067670127	You know, I've never really brought this up unless asked the question, but I have responded to the question.
0.0	0.441197059937	And, there is no one on this stage better prepared to prosecute the case against Hillary Clinton than I am.
0.0	0.441308705589	No, what I said, Chris, was that the law needs to be followed.
0.0	0.44172860015	I could only get two Republican votes on that.
0.0	0.442162360093	This is absolutely absurd.
0.0	0.442590198343	You cannot destroy ISIS with a military that's being diminished.
0.0	0.443561236865	They thought something was wrong.
0.0	0.44404406524	And he led the charge to finally fix this immigration problem that has existed now for, as Marco says, for 30 years.
0.0	0.444997236751	You will have welcomed Heidi and our girls, Caroline and Catherine, into your homes.
0.0	0.445610524264	Not committing crimes and earn legal status where you're not cutting in front of the line for people that are patiently waiting outside.
0.0	0.445843306454	It brought booming economic growth and that growth fueled rebuilding the military.
0.0	0.445851623722	I saw Ted Cruz say, "we'll take citizenship off the table, and then the bill will pass, and I'm for the bill."
0.0	0.445993607405	If you've got 10 people coming to your house and you know one of them is a terrorist, you're probably going to keep them all out.
0.0	0.44639379991	I will take her on, and when I take her on I guarantee you one thing, she will never get within 10 miles of the White House.
0.0	0.446440330267	People have invested a lot of energy into that.
0.0	0.446943744058	Hillary Clinton this week said Barack Obama would make a great Supreme Court justice.
0.0	0.447220596045	We just heard an argument back and forth that we can't solve immigration.
0.0	0.447379839482	And our focus has got to be on intelligence, increased manpower, fighting internationally targets.
0.0	0.44779061182	It wasn't the bill that I wanted, but yet it turned out to be one of the more significant pieces of veterans' legislation passed in recent history.
0.0	0.448859784733	I didn't know I had so much power.
0.0	0.448922285335	So what I had to do then is go back and start working on a bill that wasn't the bill that I wanted.
0.0	0.449096751981	As a former mayor and a former governor, there was never a single day, John, when I went to bed or woke up without realizing that this could happen in our own country.
0.0	0.449302014966	It is very clear there will be no progress on this issue in any way, shape or form, until you prove to the people of this country that illegal immigration is under control.
0.0	0.450022983125	The Cold War is over.
0.0	0.450223684428	ISIS has brought down a Russian airliner.
0.0	0.450671026135	Let's go to the major issues facing America.
0.0	0.450988668638	As president, I will support law enforcement and we'll stop radical terrorist attacks in this country by supporting our intelligence community and law enforcement community.
0.0	0.451101138544	They can provide resources.
0.0	0.451538668117	I think we ought to put in our missile defense system.
0.0	0.452780706957	The guy who systematically and habitually violates the constitution on the Supreme Court?
0.0	0.453030901202	We need, very clearly, major, major reform in a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.453508568907	So the federal solution would be the Life at Conception act which is an act that would federalize the issue.
0.0	0.455081506945	We can triple the border patrol.
0.0	0.455456818093	That is why Hillary Clinton cannot win this election.
0.0	0.45561077568	Well, first of all, it isn't the middle class.
0.0	0.455932021395	We should be developing oil, and gas, and coal, and nuclear, and wind, and solar, and ethanol, and biofuels.
0.0	0.456176858633	I -- I think -- I think as Democrats we ought to proudly support the Affordable Care Act, improve it, and make it the model that we know it can be.
0.0	0.457000272387	Well, (inaudible) the major issue right now is whether or not we reestablish Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.457388724586	But people have to be alert.
0.0	0.457711453205	Leading by fixing the things that are broken.
0.0	0.457725982893	They are not going to go away on their own.
0.0	0.458079978106	But what I did say was that the person who came in for the license needed to get it.
0.0	0.458400297795	I will break up these banks.
0.0	0.458490003796	For example, it is outrageous that we don't have an opportunity for Medicare to negotiate for lower prices.
0.0	0.458868287337	Nobela (ph) is a rising entrepreneur.
0.0	0.459162157587	So we've got to look at the full range and then come to some smart decisions about having more streamlined and focused approach.
0.0	0.459468587125	Well, first of all, I had a national reporter say, you know, there's three lanes.
0.0	0.460681090849	You know, John Adams famously said, "facts are are stubborn things."
0.0	0.461762000201	I watched that town hall meeting with the Democrats the other night, and I heard Hillary Clinton asked a direct question by an Iowan, and that's what Iowans like to do.
0.0	0.461861163676	I think, you know, Rand and I have some significant issues on policy, but I respect Rand.
0.0	0.462473431195	That's because we've put conservative policies in place.
0.0	0.463011306312	And together we make it possible for a new generation of young people to refinance their debt and not come out with debt in the future.
0.0	0.463399386242	If they want to accept our values and our laws.
0.0	0.464296159722	That's the record of accomplishment that should be taken to Hillary Clinton, who has no record of accomplishment.
0.0	0.465168783607	... everybody nervous to get out of their cars if you're a law enforcement officer.
0.0	0.465393707011	I waited and I got the scars to show for it.
0.0	0.465840926655	Three times, she refused to answer the question, because she refuses to be held accountable for anything that goes wrong.
0.0	0.465952610049	I want to see us do away with the gun show loophole.
0.0	0.466258262296	I've been to Ferguson, I've been trying to look for solutions to our criminal justice problem.
0.0	0.466543264544	Fact check me.
0.0	0.466722845454	But when we came to Washington, we made a different choice.
0.0	0.467868244287	I think that was one of the worst foreign policy blunders in the more than history of the United States.
0.0	0.467973121675	Together, leading the world, this country will rid our planet of this barbarous organization called ISIS.
0.0	0.468351491145	You can get it at $2.99 on Amazon.
0.0	0.468508715243	Go ahead.
0.0	0.468864409527	Well, we're going to have to redo the way the prescription drug industry does business.
0.0	0.469356801678	But after I said that, we're not hearing so much about Hillary Clinton's e-mails.
1.0	0.470035610065	I think we need to stop taking our advice from economists on Wall Street...
0.0	0.470048504003	As it relates to the super PACs, I have no control over that.
0.0	0.470444894742	Because he understands that I'm committed to a fair, and level playing field for every energy source without lobbyists, and without Washington picking winners and losers.
0.0	0.470545028079	If it had gone right, believe me, she would have been running around to be able to take credit for it.
0.0	0.471001688667	She did it for convenience.
0.0	0.471261453543	As far as the polls are concerned, Iowa, on Monday night you're going to go to a caucus site and you'll be the first Americans that vote in this election.
0.0	0.471638897026	I don't think taxpayers should be paying to send Donald Trump's kids to college.
0.0	0.472174682881	We saw a Muslim brotherhood president installed, and then we saw him ousted and the army back.
0.0	0.472308875217	Again, Americans murdered.
0.0	0.473204956919	Well, first of all, I know that the President has appealed the decision to the Supreme Court.
0.0	0.473233011565	My budget was mentioned.
0.0	0.473516642815	But I do believe that is a minimum.
0.0	0.47361876766	I want to build on and improve the Affordable Care Act.
0.0	0.473861018576	Well, of course, each of these cases needs to be looked at individually and analyzed.
0.0	0.474378989356	... Mr. Trump believed that in reaction to people's fears that we should ban all Muslims.
0.0	0.474871549452	Marco, Marco -- he brought up my name.
0.0	0.474924465642	You know, the mother of the young man with his friends in the car who was playing loud music and, you know, some older white man pulled out a gun and shot him because they wouldn't turn the radio down.
0.0	0.474957947935	This is what's made our nation so special.
0.0	0.475368247905	Starting with our children and moving forward.
0.0	0.475759162503	We did it, and it worked, and nobody headed for the hills or left the state because of it.
0.0	0.477256352596	The government is not always going to save us and it's not always going to come from government.
0.0	0.477991596884	It has to be with our friends in the Arab world and our friends in Europe, the coalition that we had when we went to the first Gulf War.
0.0	0.478318623971	Well, you've got to be on top of it right away.
0.0	0.478540195471	He's the greatest show on earth.
1.0	0.478778936871	And the overall message is that it doesn't result in job loss.
0.0	0.478939124284	From top to bottom.
0.0	0.479418571241	Kathie, that is the kind of economy I believe, put money in the hands of working people, raise the minimum wage to 15 buck an hour.
0.0	0.479580265335	Let me tell you something, when you see thousands upon thousands upon thousands of children being murdered in the womb, I can't think of anything better than that.
0.0	0.479615780761	I don't think any -- I don't think any sensible person would disagree that the invasion of Iraq led to the massive level of instability we are seeing right now.
0.0	0.479685223543	You want to know what carpet bombing is?
0.0	0.479881539176	Because in the end, my goal is not simply to live on this earth for 80 years, but to live an eternity with my creator.
0.0	0.480579007518	In fact, one of her first acts as president may very well be to pardon herself because Hillary Clinton...
0.0	0.481203750312	They should have made it more open ended for the next president.
0.0	0.481525451142	Well, Mr. Cooney, we've actually been focusing on border security to the exclusion of talking about comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.481636749876	I believe that our Federal Government needs to do more on pell grants.
0.0	0.481962860439	I -- I said I made a mistake on Iraq, and I would love to see Senator Sanders join with some of my colleague in addition the Senate that I see in the audience.
0.0	0.482409869216	And having been in New Hampshire and here in Iowa, but in New Hampshire, I just received the support of seven out of eight of the newspapers in that state because they see positive, they see unity, they see coming together, and they see a record of change and a record of accomplishment.
0.0	0.48294666622	Once again, I am running a campaign differently than any other candidate.
0.0	0.482991053039	It was good for the economy and it was a way to rebuke the terrorists who had attacked our country.
0.0	0.483305355056	And I stood alongside Jeff Sessions and Steve King, and we led the fight against amnesty.
0.0	0.483890092309	And we are in a situation right now in our country that we have never been in before.
0.0	0.48399105159	If we are not successful, if we continue the same old, same old of Washington being run by corporate lobbyists and big-money interests, nothing changes.
0.0	0.485025994487	But let me have one area of disagreement with the Secretary.
0.0	0.485393105039	Let's put the gun makers and sellers on notice that they're not going to get away with it.
0.0	0.485396772296	I believe capital gains, for the most part, should be taxed the same way we tax income from hard work, sweat, and toil.
0.0	0.48627587523	I think it's important we put this in historic context.
0.0	0.486911209199	The bible commands us to let our light shine on the world.
1.0	0.487677759305	Unfortunately, Nouri al-Maliki, the prime minister, set about decimating it.
0.0	0.487782548838	There were parts of that bill which agree with parts -- I disagree.
0.0	0.488112521309	It is not a barbed wire fence.
0.0	0.488348319322	In fact, Washington said that democracy requires a virtuous people.
0.0	0.488371418694	It's their time to bail out the middle class, help our kids be able to go to college tuition-free.
0.0	0.488788872258	This is a grassroots campaign and, you know, when I ran for senate in Texas, I told the people of Texas that I'm not going there to go along to get along.
0.0	0.488818384354	Check it out.
0.0	0.489166705995	Oz Guinness, the theologian, said that liberty requires restraint but the only restraint consistent with liberty is self-restraint.
0.0	0.489338620032	Reinstating Glass- Steagall is a part of what very well could help, but it is nowhere near enough.
0.0	0.48986065281	I have a comprehensive, tough plan.
0.0	0.490581705986	And he asked me to support that.
0.0	0.491011597142	Now you and I and many of the people in this audience, if we get a $100 fine, we can survive it.
0.0	0.491015779122	It'll produce enormous economic growth, and it eliminates every mandate, every subsidy, so there's no subsidies for oil and gas, no subsidies for anyone.
0.0	0.491023140996	This issue touches on two broad issues.
0.0	0.491188882654	It means that we take marijuana out of the federal law as a crime and give states the freedom to go forward with legalizing marijuana.
0.0	0.491830091584	John, thank you, and to all of the people in Iowa, for the role you have performed in this presidential selection process.
0.0	0.493647695517	You know, it's -- it's a fact that if you can pay for a $79 one-way ticket to Orlando, and you can escape the challenges of a declining economy and high crime rates, you move to Orlando.
0.0	0.494177781568	We were attacked in downtown Manhattan where Wall Street is.
0.0	0.494250019738	And I wanted to add one other thing, John, and I think it's important for all of us on this stage.
0.0	0.494716628278	So it was not against ISIS, it was against -- it was against Assad.
0.0	0.494934019417	Where were we attacked?
0.0	0.495482211081	We can end sanctuary cities by cutting off...
0.0	0.496798518261	The United States has, unfortunately, been victimized by terrorism going back decades.
0.0	0.497426896834	The federal government can play a role in allowing them to do that, but they should not -- the process of statehood or the status of Puerto Rico won't be solved until we get to the bigger issue of how you deal with the structural economic problems they're facing right now.
0.0	0.497804426295	So John, there's a big difference between leading by polls and leading with principle.
0.0	0.498208729703	I heard what they said.
0.0	0.49841056475	He was a little teddy bear to me.
0.0	0.49956681057	I have supported a consensus approach to solving this problem wherever it came up.
0.0	0.499738471605	She put American intelligence officers at risk for her convenience.

0.0	0.675371213	Chris, in 1981, when Ronald Reagan came to the Oval Office, he encountered a military that had been debilitated just as the current military has, just like Jimmy Carter weakened our readiness, undermined our ability to defend this country, so too has Barack Obama.
0.0	0.676021686633	I think that is the smartest way to be able to move forward because if you go to $12 it would be the highest historical average we've ever had.
0.0	0.676246360795	Three specific reforms that reflect those principles.
0.0	0.676322624455	But I have never supported cap- and-trade and I never thought it was a good idea.
0.0	0.676526702165	It's what we did in the first Persian Gulf war; 1,100 air attacks a day, saturation bombing that utterly destroyed the enemy.

0.0	0.677195031495	On September 11, my wife was two blocks from the World Trade Center.
0.0	0.677934480256	Ultimately, we have got to say as a nation, Secretary Clinton, is health care a right of all people or is it not?
0.0	0.678212929841	Close the gun show loophole, close the online loophole and...
0.0	0.678394559994	It basically gave the gun lobby even more power to intimidate legislators, not just in Washington but across the country.
0.0	0.678419994971	He's very smooth.
0.0	0.680047317794	That is why I support a $12 national federal minimum wage.

0.0	0.681960712623	I know there have been people who have been fired; people who are being held accountable.
0.0	0.682243163652	I introduced a series of amendments, each designed to fix problems in the bill.
0.0	0.682742662878	I am not asking Wall Street or the billionaires for money.
0.0	0.682915835035	What my campaign is about is a political revolution -- millions of people standing up and saying, enough is enough.

0.0	0.693629948917	First of all, earned path to citizenship is basically code for amnesty.
0.0	0.693911508255	But at the end of the day, no doubt, the Affordable Care Act is a step forward.
1.0	0.694207118788	It was an effort led by several people that provided almost an instant path with very little obstacles moving forward.
1.0	0.694457383157	But just think about this-- since we last debated in Las Vegas, nearly 3,000 people have been killed by guns.
0.0	0.695708388262	I believe if the amendments I introduced were adopted, that the bill would pass.
