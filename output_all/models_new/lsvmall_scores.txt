0.0	0.0232899662122	It's really a question for all of us to answer, every single one of our children deserves the chance to live up to his or her god-given potential.
0.0	0.0449031918305	Thank you.
0.0	0.0449031918305	Thank you.
0.0	0.0449031918305	Thank you.
0.0	0.0466539178955	The Shi'a-Sunni split.
0.0	0.0469691870183	But what happened at the university there, what's happening at other universities, I think reflects the deep sense of, you know, concern, even despair that so many young people, particularly of color, have...
0.0	0.0527100377808	If you -- we will not solve our nation's problems by resorting to the divisive ideologies of our past, or by returning to polarizing figures from our past.
0.0	0.0535062088824	But I think if we're ever going to really tackle the problems posed by jihadi extreme terrorism, we need to understand it and realize that it has antecedents to what happened in Iraq and we have to continue to be vigilant about it.
0.0	0.0553392068816	We ought to be working to improve it and prevent Republicans from both underming it and even repealing it.
0.0	0.0559091345219	And now, like never before, we need our Muslim American neighbors to stand up and to -- and to be a part of this.
0.0	0.0579550626758	That is what is going to have to happen, if we want to revitalize and rebuild the crumbling middle class.
0.0	0.0584459029731	Maybe now we can get it moving again so that we can upgrade it so that it does include all the tools and everything in our arsenal that we can use to try to work with our allies and our friends, come up with better intelligence.
0.0	0.0656296601421	And that this world, with American leadership, can and must come together to destroy them.
0.0	0.0694472037225	We've gotten off the Hillary's e-mails, good.
0.0	0.0707652447291	But John, let's not fall into the trap of thinking that all of our Muslim American neighbors in this country are somehow our enemies here.
0.0	0.0754579406874	Who are we kidding?
0.0	0.0789495482119	That's not the America that I think we should be.
0.0	0.0791780093183	Okay, thank you.
0.0	0.0832620817215	But it will be...
0.0	0.0832804923888	I agree with that.
0.0	0.0832922224186	And I will be laying out in detail, what I think we need to do with our friends and allies in Europe and elsewhere to do a better job of coordinating efforts against the scourge of terrorism.
0.0	0.0840935983484	I have a comprehensive, tough plan.
0.0	0.0843576863956	And in talking to a lot of our neighbors who are in that super wealthy, millionaire and billionaire category, a great numbers of them love their country enough to do more again in order to create more opportunity for America's middle class.
0.0	0.0854273391355	But wait, I just want to say this Senator.
0.0	0.0859513703667	That's American capitalism.
0.0	0.0872616143918	And that's what I will do as your president.
0.0	0.089188830377	There is no question in my mind that if we summon our resources, both our leadership resources and all of the tools at our disposal, not just military force, which should be used as a last resort, but our diplomacy, our development aid, law enforcement, sharing of intelligence in a much more open and cooperative way -- that we can bring people together.
0.0	0.0901544593176	I've heard a lot about me in this debate, and I'm going to keep talking and thinking about all of you because ultimately, I think the president's job is to do everything possible, everything that she can do to lift up the people of this country.
0.0	0.0905735618681	Thank you very, very much.
0.0	0.0919852241002	I think we need major reform in the military, making it more cost effective, but also focusing on the real crisis that faces us.
0.0	0.101674278966	Kathie, I think -- Kathie the...
0.0	0.102027424809	Well, thank you, John.
0.0	0.10400362617	That is the issue.
0.0	0.105649211428	Here's my promise-- Wall Street representatives will not be in my cabinet.
0.0	0.108328607494	I think that is...
0.0	0.108936877016	He's a progressive economist.
0.0	0.110551692681	Well, I think that they're be pretty smart, because I think a lot of the states will do the right thing, and I think those states that don't will pay a heavy penalty.
0.0	0.112394499735	And it is easy to talk the talk about ending Citizens United, but what I think we need to do is show by example that we are prepared to not rely on large corporations and Wall Street for campaign contributions, and that's what I'm doing.
0.0	0.114437003113	Our country deserves no less, because all of the other issues we want to deal with depend upon us being secure and strong.
0.0	0.114905071533	Yes, I agree.
0.0	0.114936718259	Look, we need more Americans to be involved in the political process.
0.0	0.116354214803	This is an emergency.
0.0	0.116824115658	The fact of the matter is -- and let's say it in our debate, because you'll never hear this from that immigration-bashing carnival barker, Donald Trump, the truth of the matter is...
0.0	0.117166110644	I want to use pell grants to help defray the living expenses that often make a difference, whether a young person can stay in school or not.
0.0	0.118987163462	Historically, it is important to try to understand your adversary in order to figure out how they are thinking, what they will be doing, how they will react.
0.0	0.120725025707	Afghanistan is a mess.
0.0	0.123239559048	I will do everything I can as president to get that accomplished.
0.0	0.124734681367	But it cannot be an American fight.
0.0	0.125014868766	So let's move toward what we should be doing as a nation and follow the values of our immigration history and begin to make it possible for them to come out of the shadows and to have a future that gives them a full chance of citizenship.
0.0	0.126361705399	But here's something that I believe we have to do as we put together an international coalition, and that is we have to understand that the Muslim nations in the region -- Saudi Arabia, Iran, Turkey, Jordan -- all of these nations, they're going to have to get their hands dirty, their boots on the ground.
0.0	0.133093670088	You know, maybe they're dumb and they don't know what they're going to get, but I don't think so.
0.0	0.133567214442	I think with this kind of barbarism and nihilism, it's very hard to understand, other than the lust for power, the rejection of modernity, the total disregard for human rights, freedom, or any other value that we know and respect.
0.0	0.133980831911	It cannot solely be America's fight.
0.0	0.134154539738	Thank you, John.
0.0	0.134765654687	I still want to get back to health care, because I think that's a worthy topic to explore.
0.0	0.136240866038	And we are going to be able to defeat ISIS on the ground there, as well as in this world, because of the Muslim Americans in our country and throughout the world who understand that this brutal and barbaric group is perverting the name of a great world religion.
0.0	0.136279993673	I think any parent would be so proud of them.
0.0	0.136778571131	This actually is America's fight.
0.0	0.137619635379	Everybody knows that.
0.0	0.13977797094	Parents, and sons, and daughters and family members, and as our hearts go out to them and as our prayers go out to them, we must remember this, that this isn't the new face of conflict and warfare, not in the 20th century but the new face of conflict and warfare in the 21st century.
0.0	0.140146280623	And I can do it without raising the debt, without raising taxes on the middle class and making it reasonably manageable within our budget so that we can be fiscally responsible at the same time.
0.0	0.141580152827	And it's-- it's a worthy debate.
0.0	0.142312578039	And if our middle class makes more money, they spend more money, and our whole economy grows.
0.0	0.143007851951	Iraq is a mess.
0.0	0.143013891232	Do you know where I'm going, Kevin?
0.0	0.144538013369	And we have -- and let me make this promise.
0.0	0.148582385903	But if you place good ones, you pocket it.
0.0	0.148794020209	What we need is leadership in this country which revitalizes American democracy, and makes people understand that if they stand up and fight back and take on the billionaire class, we can bring about the change that we need.
0.0	0.149205100828	And, also, acting according to our principles and constructing a new foreign policy of engagement and collaboration, and doing a much better job of identifying threats before they back up into military corners.
0.0	0.149622060275	It is not a radical idea to say that a single mom should be earning enough money to take care of her kids.
0.0	0.149944660394	And what we need to do is bring people together to work on the agreement where there is broad consensus and that's what I intend to do.
0.0	0.150208404211	I was in Burlington, Iowa.
0.0	0.15028745322	We have got to come forward with a consensus that in fact will work.
0.0	0.150917179349	And what I hear is people's concern that the economy we have is a rigged economy.
0.0	0.152241385403	I agree completely.
0.0	0.15262497422	Well, I -- if I might.
0.0	0.15333776813	I do think that it's important to defend it.
0.0	0.153841088327	John, I think somewhere between...
0.0	0.154147919815	That's what we need to do as a nation.
0.0	0.154208788422	All of you in Iowa, I need you to caucus for me.
0.0	0.15658578089	Well, I'll tell you who is on my side.
0.0	0.156744059742	But after I said that, we're not hearing so much about Hillary Clinton's e-mails.
0.0	0.157285536509	Wait a minute, he has basically used his answer to impune my integrity.
0.0	0.157678698183	And I will also go after executives who are responsible for the decisions that have such bad consequences for our country.
0.0	0.158115460396	We need, very clearly, major, major reform in a broken criminal justice system.
0.0	0.158675568224	But this cannot be an American fight, although American leadership is essential.
0.0	0.158919772466	The big banks--
0.0	0.160822029312	We need to have a resolve that will bring the world together to root out the kind of radical jihadist ideology that motivates organizations like ISIS, a barbaric, ruthless, violent jihadist terrorist group.
0.0	0.163836971317	It is not a radical idea to say that if somebody works 40 hours a week, that person should not be living in poverty.
0.0	0.167085473638	So they clearly think I'm going to do what I say I will do and you can look at what I did in the Senate.
0.0	0.167869563647	Let's be frank here.
0.0	0.169380959705	Once again, I am running a campaign differently than any other candidate.
0.0	0.171551458765	And it is imperative that we do more not only to help our friends and partners protect themselves and protect our own homeland, but also to work to try to deal with this arc of instability, which does have a lot of impact on what happens in a country like Libya.
1.0	0.171680221092	I think we need to stop taking our advice from economists on Wall Street...
0.0	0.171993765587	I'd like to take a matter of personal privilege here...
0.0	0.172254806771	So for me, it is looking at what works and what we need to do to try to move past what happened in '08.
0.0	0.172929197186	And for the sake of our economy, they must -- the major banks must be broken up.
0.0	0.173279474101	And if you listen to what they say -- and I had a chance over those 11 hours to watch and listen, as well as what I see in their debates -- they are putting forth alarming plans.
0.0	0.174252919209	And when he moved on his own people, threatening a massacre, genocide, the Europeans and the Arabs, our allies and partners, did ask for American help and we provided it.
0.0	0.17470451079	Kevin, if I could just jump in.
0.0	0.175474075491	I said we should go to 65, but only if we have as careful a screening and vetting process as we can imagine, whatever resources it takes because I do not want us to, in any way, inadvertently allow people who wish us harm to come into our country.
0.0	0.177960626879	Break them up.
0.0	0.178620861209	I mean, you know, let's not be naive about it.
0.0	0.179581633578	What we need to do is lead an international coalition which includes very significantly the Muslim nations in that region who are going to have to fight and defend their way of life.
0.0	0.180516707786	Look--
0.0	0.181759786208	And I would hope in the midst of all of this discussion, this country makes certain that we do not turn our backs on the men and women who put their lives on the line to defend us, and that we stand with them as they have stood with us.
0.0	0.18223641394	That is what I want to do.
0.0	0.183961319412	Go on to martinomalley.com.
0.0	0.184152707595	The problem is...
0.0	0.185233960097	Libya is now a mess.
0.0	0.185613084282	And it's not just a question for parents and grandparents to answer.
0.0	0.186692624757	If you want to make it into the middle class -- I'm not saying in all cases -- we need plumbers, and we need carpenters, and electricians, that's for sure, and they should get help as well.
0.0	0.187368581795	Now I am the only candidate up here that doesn't have a super PAC.
0.0	0.193229927829	But it's a lot safer.
0.0	0.193382892113	And I will pay for it by, yes, taxing the wealthy more, closing corporate loopholes, deductions, and other kinds of favorable treatment.
0.0	0.19454512281	Well, John, I think that we have to look at ISIS as the leading threat of an international terror network.
0.0	0.195243111838	We have -- I don't know that there's any disagreement here...
0.0	0.198579760252	Well, I think that there are different records.
0.0	0.1988331454	So let's focus on what this election is really going to be about.
0.0	0.199094353165	We should be supportive of that effort.
0.0	0.200287437566	And my reading of the law and the Constitution convinces me that the President has the authority that he is attempting to exercise with respect to dreamers and their parents, because I think all of us on this stage agree that we need comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.
0.0	0.203747320389	Let me just...
0.0	0.203747320389	Let me just...
0.0	0.205065395817	But I can tell you this.
0.0	0.205535166441	I think we all support it.
0.0	0.207150966358	Let me...
0.0	0.207150966358	Let's...
0.0	0.20726614509	... and I encourage everybody watching this tonight to please, acknowledge that by going online at martinomalley.com and help me wage this campaign for real American capitalism.
0.0	0.208208068343	If you believe that our country's problems and the threats that we face in this world can only be met with new thinking, new and fresh approaches, then I ask you to join my campaign.
0.0	0.208790832357	I believe that actually affordable college, debt-free college is the goal that we need to attain as a nation.
0.0	0.209709965979	But bottom line now, is in America, in the year 2015, any person who has the ability and the desire should be able to get an education, college education, regardless of the income of his or her family.
0.0	0.209813259021	This issue touches on two broad issues.
0.0	0.21076513168	Let me get a chance to respond.
0.0	0.210877038978	What part is valid?
0.0	0.211284361317	Didn't just happen.
0.0	0.211823175072	So, I want to look at the whole problem and that's why my proposal is much more comprehensive than anything else that's been put forth.
0.0	0.214678582449	So, you know, it's fine for you to say what you're going to say, but I looked very carefully at your proposal.
0.0	0.216834961387	I think it ought to be a compact -- families contribute, kids contribute.
0.0	0.219556548877	I -- I believe that we should make community college free.
0.0	0.219826803464	The Secretary's obviously right.
0.0	0.220456671291	And it requires an entire world to come together, including in a very active way, the Muslim nations.
0.0	0.220897289282	We took out the safe haven in Afghanistan, but now there is, undoubtedly, a larger safe haven and we must rise to this occasion in collaboration and with alliances to confront it, and invest in the future much better human intelligence so we know what the next steps are.
0.0	0.220959584449	We have to do away with the strawman proposal.
0.0	0.221791879409	And I know that term gets my Republican friends nervous.
0.0	0.224184757266	That's why I've got such a good plan.
0.0	0.22625589208	Well, thank you very much to CBS and everyone here this evening for giving us another chance to appear before you.
0.0	0.226482034557	And its bankruptcy and its failure nearly destroyed us.
0.0	0.226713018287	But I would want to agree with something that Senator Sanders says.
0.0	0.226946564061	But I don't want us to be painting with too broad a brush.
0.0	0.228173518195	And we do have a role in this.
0.0	0.228325523776	That's who I'm indebted to.
0.0	0.229583897397	Sit down with people like John Mccain.
0.0	0.230889287004	And there are many ways of doing it.
1.0	0.234937167243	He is the foremost expert in our country on the minimum wage, and what its effects are.
0.0	0.234989904452	We should have debt-free college if you go to a public college or university.
0.0	0.235569753446	But I did want to -- I wanted to follow up.
0.0	0.235892662431	So, your original question is the right question.
0.0	0.236233792867	Syria is a mess.
0.0	0.236358133581	Go ahead.
0.0	0.236856384055	All right, Nancy, I really wish you'd come back to me on this on this one, John...
0.0	0.238475407592	But I had to stand up and come back and get the best that we could.
0.0	0.238643982108	And also -- also, what we should be clear about is we end up spending -- and I think the secretary knows this -- far more per capita on health care than any other major country, and our outcomes, health care outcomes are not necessarily that good.
0.0	0.238982376031	We have made some good progress.
0.0	0.240025675959	We must able to work collaboratively with others.
0.0	0.240335175472	John, I don't think that there is a crisis at the state or local level that really you can point to and say, therefore, I am prepared for the sort of crises that any man or woman who is commander in chief of our country has to deal with.
0.0	0.240819951566	It -- it doesn't need to be that way.
0.0	0.243462816501	We can do that.
0.0	0.24366395743	They elected moderate leaders.
0.0	0.244477802538	You know, the mother of the young man with his friends in the car who was playing loud music and, you know, some older white man pulled out a gun and shot him because they wouldn't turn the radio down.
0.0	0.245527479303	And that's what we need to be doing to the best of our ability in our country.
0.0	0.24565736057	I respectfully disagree with Senator Sander's approach.
0.0	0.246258505274	... And start taking advice...
0.0	0.246478001491	Again, with all do respect to Secretary Clinton...
0.0	0.248543635155	Right.
0.0	0.248782415284	Not solely ours, but we must work collaboratively with other nations.
0.0	0.249162653027	We've got the consensus, what we're lacking is political leadership...
1.0	0.249827131063	I have voted time and again to -- for -- for the background check, and I want to see it improved and expanded.
0.0	0.250039177106	I will work my heart out.
0.0	0.250265538267	Well John, wait a minute.
0.0	0.251597210556	It cannot be contained, it must be defeated.
0.0	0.251966415893	Yeah, but look.
0.0	0.251976422045	I would like to see it updated.
0.0	0.253204847249	And if we do those things, we can be a country that actually can afford debt-free college again.
0.0	0.253872434961	Or a young woman who had been performing at President Obama's second inauguration coming home, absolutely stellar young woman, hanging out with her friends in a park getting shot by a gang member.
0.0	0.255604795557	Let's go to the major issues facing America.
0.0	0.255859627803	The problem is, this redistribution has gone in the wrong direction.
0.0	0.2562593719	I was sick and tired of Hillary Clinton's e-mail.
0.0	0.256896678334	And I have to tell you, I would not want -- if I lived in Iowa, Terry Branstad administering my health care.
0.0	0.257282416974	That is what the Democrats in the Senate have put forward as a proposal.
0.0	0.258126206946	Oh, yes there is.
0.0	0.259591435395	It should always be going up.
0.0	0.261649800028	Yes.
0.0	0.261649800028	Yes.
0.0	0.261649800028	Yes.
0.0	0.261649800028	Yes.
0.0	0.261649800028	Yes.
0.0	0.261649800028	Yes.
0.0	0.261649800028	Yes.
0.0	0.262148651622	It's an important one that we should be engaged in.
0.0	0.263651195132	I'm going to be independent.
0.0	0.264018758772	Our role in the world is not to roam the globe looking for new dictators to topple.
0.0	0.264328090386	If Teddy Roosevelt, a good Republican, were alive today, you know what he'd say?
0.0	0.264698600959	We are at the threshold of a new era of American progress, but it's going to require that we act as Americans, based on our principles, here at home, making an economy that works for all of us.
0.0	0.265900932914	I couldn't talk to anybody about it.
0.0	0.266817562836	It will not happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.26791615648	Look at what happened in '08, AIG, a big insurance company, Lehman Brothers, an investment bank helped to bring our economy down.
0.0	0.268797427313	And many of the fights that are going on are not ones that the United States has either started or have a role in.
0.0	0.269752486485	I would certainly tackle the cost issues, because I think that once the foundation was laid with a system to try to get as many people as possible into it, to end insurance discrimination against people with preexisting conditions or women, for example, that, yes, we were going to have to figure out how to get more competition in the insurance market, how to get the costs of -- particularly, prescription drugs, but other out-of-pocket expenses down.
0.0	0.269966008042	And I will go back and say again, AIG was not a big bank.
0.0	0.27054323103	Let me hear if there's any difference between the Secretary and myself.
0.0	0.271324228698	Yeah.
0.0	0.272505278869	States need to stop cutting higher education, and we should create a new block grant program that keeps the states' skin in the game, and we should lower these outrageous interest rates that parents and kids are being charged by their own government.
0.0	0.273166756991	I disagree with free college for everybody.
0.0	0.273320520356	Starting with our children and moving forward.
0.0	0.273321324564	Well, I think it's pretty clear that they know that I will.
0.0	0.274236047587	But in order to bring about the changes that we need, we need a political revolution.
0.0	0.276271547417	O' Malley: John, please, it's-- personal privilege, John.
0.0	0.279178095389	That's what our parents and grandparents always did.
0.0	0.279322516743	We have problems with Russia.
0.0	0.279775349741	The fact of the matter is, the more our people earn, the more money they spend, and the more our whole economy grows.
0.0	0.280820537164	With all -- with all due respect...
0.0	0.281908705479	And then, with the revolution against Assad -- and I did early on say we needed to try to find a way to train and equip moderates very early so that we would have a better idea of how to deal with Assad because I thought there would be extremist groups filling the vacuum.
0.0	0.282386609944	Please go to hillaryclinton.com and be part of making this country what we know it can and should be.
0.0	0.287191460658	We had all kinds of questions that we discussed and, you know, at the end, I recommended to the president that we take the chance to do what we could to find out whether that was bin Laden and to finally bring him to justice.
0.0	0.288984482968	I am not the candidate of Wall Street...
0.0	0.289728168313	They would like to rip it up and start all over again, throw our nation back into this really contentious debate that we've had about health care for quite some time now.
0.0	0.28997684245	So, I mean this may seem like a bit of an arcane discussion.
0.0	0.29046157194	That's right.
0.0	0.29046157194	That's right.
0.0	0.290635841946	And I think what the president has consistently said-- which I agree with-- is that we will support those who take the fight to ISIS.
0.0	0.291461715806	It was an excruciating experience.
0.0	0.294667919054	But, of course, international terrorism is a major issue that we have got to address today.
0.0	0.294893619025	You learn to create a security cabinet.
0.0	0.295108288133	These are American soldiers and we fail them when we fail to take into account what happens the day after a dictator falls and when we fail to act with a whole of government approach with sustainable development, diplomacy, and our economic power in alignment with our principles.
0.0	0.298399809808	So I believe that over the next few years, not tomorrow, but over the next few years, we have got to move the minimum wage to a living wage, 15 bucks an hour.
0.0	0.299009129901	Again, Americans murdered.
0.0	0.299034536469	Let me do that but let me pick up on an issue, a very important issue that we have not yet discussed.
0.0	0.300597980941	And if we do not get our act together and listen to what the scientists say, you're going to see countries all over the world -- this is what the CIA says -- they're going to be struggling over limited amounts of water, limited amounts of land to grow their crops ask you're going to see all kinds of international conflict.
0.0	0.301901058506	Lehman Brothers was not a big bank.
0.0	0.302788433833	Now what we have to take on is the pharmaceutical industry that is ripping off the American people every single day.
0.0	0.304521523012	The issue is -- I believe, and I believe this honestly, and I don't know that there's much difference on guns between us.
0.0	0.306897687877	I think we're at war with jihadists who have --
0.0	0.309709704435	This election is not only about electing a president.
0.0	0.310016126003	Well, this is what I would say, and the Congressman was right.
0.0	0.311370957827	We've got to have them be part of our coalition.
0.0	0.312339476007	The dictatorships have suppressed people's aspirations.
0.0	0.312553692206	This is the new sort of challenge, the new sort of threat that does, in fact, require new thinking, fresh approaches and new leadership.
0.0	0.313765073823	But I certainly think that the United States should take its full responsibility in helping those people.
0.0	0.315470680404	Yes, we must protect our borders.
0.0	0.319255815568	That's crony capitalism.
0.0	0.319282765233	John, may I -- may I interject here?
0.0	0.320333364178	That's what it is.
0.0	0.320486087825	DICKERSON: A question from Kathie Obradovich.
0.0	0.328326156943	So there's a lot of work we need to do and I want to be sure what's called the AUMF, has the authority that is needed going forward.
0.0	0.328939629208	And to contrast, even -- there are differences among us.
0.0	0.328961249987	It is about understanding the secondary and third consequences that fall next.
0.0	0.330047652111	We were the first to pass a minimum wage.
0.0	0.330141614399	No.
0.0	0.330141614399	No.
0.0	0.330940130291	Well, there are so many, I don't know where to start.
0.0	0.330998213439	It's not going to happen tomorrow.
0.0	0.331597905495	Those hedge funds.
0.0	0.33346197413	I will break up these banks.
0.0	0.333943047288	Reestablish Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.334141307613	She worked -- and many of us supported you -- in trying to rebuild that devastation.
0.0	0.334360902908	It's not just about getting rid of a single dictator.
0.0	0.334751169022	Kathie, let me say this.
0.0	0.335108732944	So we've got to look at the full range and then come to some smart decisions about having more streamlined and focused approach.
0.0	0.335636756835	Medicare for all, single-payer system is the way we should go.
0.0	0.336972574526	Let's do more -- let's do more than reverse the immunity.
0.0	0.3374237102	In fact, if more border security and these -- and more and more deportations were going to bring our Republican brothers and sisters to the table, it would have happened long ago.
0.0	0.338202836036	It's what happened in Governor O'Malley's state.
0.0	0.33919364747	But those Muslim countries are going to have to lead the effort.
0.0	0.339312826529	But Secretary Clinton, you've been on three sides of this.
0.0	0.339962573048	John, this is another one of those examples.
0.0	0.342184637625	Our government belongs to all of us, and not just the hand full of billionaires.
0.0	0.342411332969	And those countries who are opposed to Islam, they are going to have to get deeply involved in a way that is not the case today.
0.0	0.3427717648	We've been struggling to get this done since Harry Truman.
0.0	0.343969134113	Well, let me just say something.
0.0	0.34401510928	It wasn't the bill that I wanted, but yet it turned out to be one of the more significant pieces of veterans' legislation passed in recent history.
0.0	0.344072440448	America is best when we work in collaboration with our allies.
0.0	0.344224971737	I believe that the goal should be debt-free college.
0.0	0.34477579313	I am still sick and tired of Hillary Clinton's e-mails.
0.0	0.344798150096	I think the issue here is -- and I applaud Secretary Clinton.
0.0	0.345697078633	Why is it that we are spending per capita far, far more than Canada, which is 100 miles away from my door, that guarantees health care to all people?
0.0	0.34675958564	I would say that on this issue, I'm a little bit more conservative than the Secretary...
0.0	0.34692129159	I could only get two Republican votes on that.
0.0	0.347087436483	It's also about choosing our next commander-in-chief.
0.0	0.348153751445	I'm all about making sure we actually get results for whatever we do.
0.0	0.348899970202	One of the problems we have had -- I think all Americans understand this, is whether it's Republican administrations or Democratic administrations, we have seen Wall Street and Goldman Sachs dominate administrations.
0.0	0.349479031127	We have to go after price gouging and monopolistic practices and get Medicare the authority to negotiate.
0.0	0.349749502049	Paul Volcker, one of the leading lights of trying to reign in the excesses, has also said he does not support reinstating Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.349905700468	They are doing everything they can to prevent the voices of Americans to be heard.
0.0	0.350782102823	So I don't think you can paint with a broad brush.
0.0	0.352222377299	That's a part of the problem and I am going right at them.
0.0	0.353674937637	But -- but we are going to end the absurdity, as Warren Buffet often remind us.
0.0	0.356960797328	And it's probably not going to happen until we have real campaign finance reform and get rid of all these superpacs, and the power of the insurance companies and the drug companies.
0.0	0.357393845635	They have children who are doing so well, I've met and worked with dreamers.
0.0	0.357672326043	No, I have not.
0.0	0.358318014367	You know, I recently met with a group of mothers who lost their children to either killings by police or random killings in their neighborhoods, and hearing their stories was so incredibly, profoundly heartbreaking.
0.0	0.358869413806	I believe calling it what it is, is to say radical jihadis.
0.0	0.360313240243	I looked at ways that the shareholders would have more control over what was going on in that arena.
0.0	0.361981122737	They are going to have to take on ISIS.
0.0	0.36216275642	Well, first of all, it isn't the middle class.
0.0	0.36243132044	And I agree with much of what the Secretary and the Governor have said.
0.0	0.362531037234	And I wanted to add one other thing, John, and I think it's important for all of us on this stage.
0.0	0.36307249626	We also had attacks on two of our embassies in Tanzania, Kenya, when my husband was president.
0.0	0.365390328379	... and that's what you and others can start providing in the Senate.
0.0	0.366961091544	And, yes, we are at war with those people.
0.0	0.367332057992	But let me have one area of disagreement with the Secretary.
0.0	0.368022627879	CLINTON: Oh, wait a minute, senator.
0.0	0.368982308641	You've heard some of those tonight.
0.0	0.369143929611	Now, in fact, what we have got to do -- and I think there is widespread agreement here -- is the United States cannot do it alone.
0.0	0.369990795637	So we have a lot of work to do to get jobs going again, get incomes rising again.
0.0	0.372151502973	I think we have a disagreement, and the disagreement is that not only did I vote against the war in Iraq.
0.0	0.373510437115	We got it done in my state by leading with principal and that's what we need to do as a party for comprehensive gun safety.
0.0	0.373537057045	I'm going to support you, and I think that is absolutely appropriate.
0.0	0.374653925363	I need your help.
0.0	0.374653925363	I need your help.
0.0	0.374967322417	My heart, like all of us in this room, John, and all the people across our country, my hearts go out to the people of France in this moment of loss.
0.0	0.375006397157	But the truth of the matter is, if we want wages to go up, we've got to get 11 million of our neighbors out of off the book shadow economy, and into the full light of an American economy.
0.0	0.376613527083	Well, John, let me concur with you and with all Americans who are shocked and disgusted by what we saw in Paris yesterday.
0.0	0.378093529421	Please go to berniesanders.com.
0.0	0.379845059267	they expect to get something.
0.0	0.382098605008	She did.
0.0	0.382232522608	Let's put the gun makers and sellers on notice that they're not going to get away with it.
0.0	0.382295585069	You know, no public policy doesn't have, in some cases, negative consequences.
0.0	0.382303670878	That's not fair.
0.0	0.382718806662	We did it, and it worked, and nobody headed for the hills or left the state because of it.
0.0	0.383461352506	In terms of Wall Street, I respectfully disagree with you, madam secretary, in the sense that the issue here is when you have such incredible power and such incredible wealth.
0.0	0.383671160655	And it was not only a great accomplishment of the Democratic Party, but of President Obama.
0.0	0.383708696397	So should the UK, so should France.
0.0	0.383851348452	It means that we take marijuana out of the federal law as a crime and give states the freedom to go forward with legalizing marijuana.
0.0	0.385394876917	Come on now.
0.0	0.385491194028	I believe we've got to go further.
0.0	0.38604527077	There has to be real tax reform, and the wealthiest and large corporations will pay when I'm president.
0.0	0.3917894536	The increasing globalization without any real safety valve for people to have a better life.
0.0	0.392151786939	But I want to say a quick word about what Senator Sanders and then Governor O'Malley said.
0.0	0.392199135565	The Cold War is over.
0.0	0.393063179694	I want to end the international embarrassment of the United States of America being the only major country on earth that doesn't guarantee health care to all people as a right, not a privilege.
0.0	0.393428140956	Look at what's happening with the Republicans.
0.0	0.393595889115	(APPLAUSE) They're trying to prevent people from registering to vote.
0.0	0.394068349736	Close the gun show loophole, close the online loophole and...
0.0	0.39560594737	I don't know and with all due respect to the secretary, Wall Street played by the rules?
0.0	0.395650276872	There are other ways to lead and to be a moral leader in this world, rather than at the opposite end of a drone strike.
0.0	0.395881706065	Reinstating Glass- Steagall is a part of what very well could help, but it is nowhere near enough.
0.0	0.396424240116	Each one of them, you know, described their child, had a picture.
0.0	0.397314412699	That was a terrible mistake.
0.0	0.397459019169	And Secretary Clinton, unfortunately, is on the wrong side.
0.0	0.397524503155	We need to be much more far thinking in this new 21st century era of -- of nation state failures and conflict.
0.0	0.399231676749	All of us want equal pay for equal work.
0.0	0.399358203401	Well, of course, each of these cases needs to be looked at individually and analyzed.
0.0	0.400290250083	And, you know, I do think it's important to do exactly what Senator Sanders said, and that is to start talking about the issues that the American people really care about, and that they talk to each of us about.
0.0	0.400704482542	So I've said, if the big banks don't play by the rules, I will break them up.
0.0	0.400771580112	Well, our prayers are with the people of France tonight, but that is not enough.
0.0	0.401129510905	And our focus has got to be on intelligence, increased manpower, fighting internationally targets.
0.0	0.402234060805	I mean, my dad went to college on a G.I.
0.0	0.402274081809	They can provide forces.
0.0	0.402692190091	We were proud of them on graduation day, but we're going to be proud every month for the rest of our natural lives.
0.0	0.403255392658	Well, John, I come from the '60s, a long time ago.
1.0	0.403978896091	And the overall message is that it doesn't result in job loss.
0.0	0.404482279844	I want to see us do away with the gun show loophole.
0.0	0.408506557973	So, yes, I did know people.
0.0	0.410410887123	But they need to be absolutely clear about where they stand.
0.0	0.412083053279	Let me put those proposals-- and you're absolutely right.
0.0	0.412134241808	I have -- look, I would agree with much of what Senator Sanders says, Kevin.
0.0	0.412261730743	There is no challenge too great for the United States to confront, provided we have the ability and the courage to put forward new leadership that can move us to those better and safer and more prosperous days.
0.0	0.412312393266	I don't think the term is what's important.
0.0	0.412533032607	Now, what the magic number is, I don't know, because we don't know the extent of the problem.
0.0	0.413670596729	We've got challenges in the South China Sea because of what China is doing in building up these military installations.
0.0	0.414261919334	They are our first line of defense.
0.0	0.41497565096	Well, Mr. Cooney, we've actually been focusing on border security to the exclusion of talking about comprehensive immigration reform.
0.0	0.41547998297	It's campaign -- a corrupt campaign finance system.
0.0	0.416078398072	Well, you know, governor, I know that when you had a chance to appoint a commissioner for financial regulation, you chose an investment banker in 2010.
1.0	0.416389737167	The 500,000 who came home with PTSD, and traumatic brain injury.
0.0	0.417007013177	John, thank you, and to all of the people in Iowa, for the role you have performed in this presidential selection process.
0.0	0.417022835798	And so, look, the way that -- a stronger middle class is actually the source of economic growth.
0.0	0.417055119758	So John, there's a big difference between leading by polls and leading with principle.
0.0	0.419080340492	It's their time to bail out the middle class, help our kids be able to go to college tuition-free.
0.0	0.419538743587	I have been tried under many different emergencies and I can tell you that in each of those emergencies, whether they were inflicted by drug gangs, whether they were natural emergencies, I knew how to lead and I knew how to govern because I know how to manage people in a crisis and be very clear about the goal of protecting human life.
0.0	0.419775053125	I want those kids to know that if they study hard, they do their homework, regardless of the income of their families, they will in fact be able to get a college education because we are going to make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
0.0	0.421545385703	I couldn't have said it better myself.
0.0	0.42192773427	Well, (inaudible) the major issue right now is whether or not we reestablish Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.422142326941	We do have to take a hard look at the defense budget and we do have to figure out how we get ready to fight the adversaries of the future, not the past.
0.0	0.422501393352	We can have debt-free college in the United States.
0.0	0.422951477516	The issue now is do we break them ?up do we reestablish Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.424091493332	The great failing of these last 10 or 15 years, John, has been our failing of human intelligence on the ground.
0.0	0.426229889944	We should make women third-class citizens, that we should allow children to be sexually assaulted, that they are a danger to modern society.
0.0	0.426417022497	But I went further than that.
0.0	0.428055610664	Their business model is greed and fraud.
0.0	0.428803224366	And together we make it possible for a new generation of young people to refinance their debt and not come out with debt in the future.
0.0	0.428972149045	We bailed out Wall Street.
0.0	0.428989700472	No, it would have to go through the Congress, and I know the White House has actually been working with members of Congress.
0.0	0.429629772801	I would want us to take our place among the nations of the world to alleviate this sort of death and the specter we saw of little kids' bodies washing up on a beach.
0.0	0.431121161626	I like how you stand up.
0.0	0.432737277432	When we put money into the hands of working people, they're going to go out and buy goods, they're going to buy services and they're going to create jobs in doing that.
0.0	0.433476028462	I think it's fair to say that Baltimore is not now one of the safest cities in America, but the issue is...
0.0	0.43355867729	But I do take what Alan Krueger said seriously.
0.0	0.434218087305	And the issue is, the problem is, the front pages every day were dealing with it.
0.0	0.43996880116	You should not have to borrow a dime to pay tuition.
0.0	0.439969104188	And then on top of that, we've got a corrupt campaign finance system in which millionaires and billionaires are pouring huge sums of money into super PACS heavily influencing the political process.
0.0	0.440475015643	So, yes, this has developed.
0.0	0.440619590683	I did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild.
0.0	0.440715358662	You learn to create feedback mechanisms.
0.0	0.440740510344	Obviously, I believe that on a college campus, there should be enough respect so people hear each other.
0.0	0.440992256883	But you would index it -- you would index it to the median wage.
0.0	0.444146375313	I -- I think -- I think as Democrats we ought to proudly support the Affordable Care Act, improve it, and make it the model that we know it can be.
0.0	0.444789355478	We're giving young people and working people hope that real change can take place in America.
0.0	0.44506636992	We have more people in jail today than any other country on earth.
0.0	0.445224905646	From top to bottom.
0.0	0.445561062974	This is a new era of conflict where traditional ways of huge standing armies are not as -- serve our purposes as well as special ops, better intelligence and being more proactive.
0.0	0.446593412514	We have a lot of work to do, to better prepare our nation and to better lead this world into this new century.
0.0	0.447698100295	I think after 11 hours, that's pretty clear, yes.
0.0	0.448432776604	And the U.S. chamber of commerce, which hardly ever says nice things about Democratic governors anywhere, named our state number one for innovation and entrepreneurship.
0.0	0.448593483738	I don't think taxpayers should be paying to send Donald Trump's kids to college.
0.0	0.448982259098	I didn't know I had so much power.
0.0	0.44905922313	I think that there are many other reasons why it has in addition to what happened in the region, but I don't think that the United States has the bulk of the responsibility.
0.0	0.450423073853	I don't think we're at war with all Muslims.
0.0	0.450504085176	Looking forward to it.
0.0	0.45203016755	Germany, many other countries do it already.
0.0	0.452566854548	And I have laid out specific plans -- you can go to my web site, hillaryclinton.com, and read the details.
0.0	0.452709148666	John, there is not a serious economist who would disagree that the six big banks of Wall Street have taken on so much power and that all of us are still on the hook to bail them out on their bad bets.
0.0	0.452717692797	That's not capitalism, Secretary Clinton.
0.0	0.453549732452	Here's the story.
1.0	0.453653710257	Well, we have an authorization to use military force against terrorists.
0.0	0.455954573356	But we have to also be very clear that we do have some continuing challenges.
0.0	0.457024397432	So what I had to do then is go back and start working on a bill that wasn't the bill that I wanted.
0.0	0.457097887834	So was I, John.
0.0	0.457277922985	John, I would disagree with Secretary Clinton respectfully on this score.
0.0	0.45737056629	Let's don't use the term 'boots on the ground'.
0.0	0.458262163104	And then, of course, 9/11 happened, which happened before there was an invasion of Iraq.
0.0	0.459464717007	You have two billionaire hedge fund managers who started a super PAC and they're advertising against me in Iowa as we speak.
0.0	0.460474759197	I just don't think it would get the job done.
0.0	0.460950441524	Paul Krugman, the Nobel Prize winning economist, who said my plan for what we should do to reign in Wall Street was more comprehensive and better.
0.0	0.461744042964	When you talk about the long-term consequences of war, let's talk about the men and women who came home from war.
0.0	0.462018236354	But the other thing I just wanted quickly to say is, I think President Obama deserves more credit than he gets for what he got done in Washington, despite the Republican obstructionists.
0.0	0.464541100108	It ain't complicated.
0.0	0.465229400874	In my own state, after the children in that Connecticut classroom were gunned down, we passed comprehensive gun safety legislation with background checks, ban on assault weapons, and Senator, I think we do need to repeal that immunity that you granted to the gun industry.
0.0	0.46685464294	Make ourselves stronger at home, but also our role in the world, yes, is also to confront evil when it rises.
1.0	0.467770794405	In fact, wages adjusted for inflation haven't risen since the turn of the last century, after my husband's administration.
0.0	0.469700603876	If we are not successful, if we continue the same old, same old of Washington being run by corporate lobbyists and big-money interests, nothing changes.
0.0	0.46984382261	That makes no sense at all.
0.0	0.470003693455	But I...
0.0	0.471078498882	So, we do need to take on the Republicans very clearly and directly.
0.0	0.471319192594	It is not a barbed wire fence.
0.0	0.474379450259	So I believe that, in fact, this country needs to move towards a living wage.
0.0	0.475902835683	I believe it is a right.
0.0	0.476589838086	Well, we're going to have to redo the way the prescription drug industry does business.
0.0	0.4778710165	I have nothing against the passion that my two friends here have about reinstating Glass-Steagall.
0.0	0.478498106203	John, I had the honor of being chairman of the U.S. Senate committee on Veterans' Affairs for two years.
0.0	0.478788800995	But the differences among us pale compared to what's happening on the Republican side.
0.0	0.479074339513	Support community banks and credit unions.
0.0	0.479233705436	They are not doing it now.
0.0	0.479287484359	And there is no nation on the planet better able to adapt to this change than our nation.
0.0	0.47998577876	You know, it is difficult finding intelligence that is actionable in a lot of these places, but we have to keep trying.
1.0	0.481317883858	And I'm very proud that for the first time a majority of my donors are women, 60 percent.
0.0	0.481889164826	I am certainly, absolutely, willing to look at that bill again and make sure there's a stronger bill.
0.0	0.482922311083	I think it's important we put this in historic context.
0.0	0.483092182704	I waited and I got the scars to show for it.
0.0	0.484979357019	Millions of people are going to have to stand up, turn off the TV, get involved in the political process and tell the big- money interest that we are taking back our country.
0.0	0.485479149136	So, what we want to do is to say, look, we have 11 million people who have been here, many of them for decades.
0.0	0.486694139044	... And that I am not a great fan of regime change.
0.0	0.487923318133	There was nobody to talk to and it really did give me an insight into the very difficult problems presidents face.
0.0	0.488934757116	But when millions of people stand up and are prepared to take on the insurance companies and the drug companies, it will happen, and I will lead that effort.
0.0	0.48899388645	But I do believe that is a minimum.
0.0	0.493118051918	So we pay for this by do demanding that the wealthiest people and the largest corporations, who have gotten away with murder for years, start paying their fair share.
0.0	0.493210589211	I don't think we're at war with Islam.
0.0	0.5	I am not asking Wall Street or the billionaires for money.
0.0	0.5	I believe capital gains, for the most part, should be taxed the same way we tax income from hard work, sweat, and toil.
0.0	0.5	I have said the invasion of Iraq was a mistake.
0.0	0.5	If you place bad bets, the taxpayers bail you out.
0.0	0.5	It was good for the economy and it was a way to rebuke the terrorists who had attacked our country.
0.0	0.5	It's saved a lot of lives along the way, Senator.
0.0	0.5	Not only were we the first state in the nation to pass a living wage.
0.0	0.5	There was a lot of activism on campus -- Civil Rights activism, antiwar activism, women's rights activism -- and I do appreciate the way young people are standing up and speaking out.
0.0	0.5	They can provide resources.
0.0	0.5	We must anticipate these threats before they happen.
0.0	0.5	We need radical changes in mental health in America so somebody who is suicidal or homicidal can get the emergency care they need.
0.0	0.505391468526	It's become more complicated.
0.0	0.507964617551	I'm running for president, because as I go around this nation, I talk to a lot of people.
0.0	0.509177856328	More importantly, I want kids in Burlington, Vermont, or Baltimore, Maryland, who are in the sixth grade or the eighth grade, who don't have a lot of money, whose parents -- like my parents -- may never have gone to college.
0.0	0.509228731203	This is what I think -- this is what many economists believe that one of the reasons that real unemployment in this country is 10 percent, one of the reasons that African American youth unemployment and underemployment is 51 percent is the average worker in America doesn't have any disposable income.
0.0	0.509364756599	Are they going to stand with us against this kind of jihadi radicalism or not?
0.0	0.510716398892	I really put that on Assad and on the Iraqis and on the region itself.
0.0	0.510732027826	So, there does need to be a whole of government approach, but just because we're involved and we have a strategy doesn't mean we're going to be able to dictate the outcome.
0.0	0.511331663883	That is why we have troops in Iraq that are helping to train and build back up the Iraqi military, why we have special operators in Syria working with the Kurds and Arabs, so that we can be supportive.
0.0	0.51371069462	My son is not a pair of boots on the ground.
0.0	0.516298196741	It had to be bailed out and it nearly destroyed us.
0.0	0.517522126139	They don't believe in any of that.
0.0	0.517642978995	So the crisis was I lost what I wanted.
0.0	0.517744996775	You learn to constantly evaluate and understand the nature of the threats that you are being faced with.
0.0	0.519694931214	We brought together legislation supported by the American Legion, the VFW, the DOD, Vietnam Vets, all of the veterans organizations, which was comprehensive.
0.0	0.519887950035	And places like Seattle, like Los Angeles, like New York City, they can go higher.
0.0	0.520219195029	It's not just Wall Street.
0.0	0.52056891604	What is important to understand is we have organizations, whether it is ISIS or Al Qaida, who do believe we should go back several thousand years.
0.0	0.522347152117	But I think it's important to understand there's a significant difference that I have with Senator Sanders about how best to provide quality, affordable health care for everyone.
0.0	0.524999174513	Let me just add to that.
0.0	0.52556345905	That was good for New York.
0.0	0.525710222705	Because we have found a way to reduce hospital costs, so whenever we come...
0.0	0.525906621886	That's a wonderful business model.
0.0	0.527390405308	Well, I'm sorry that whoever tweeted that had that impression because I worked closely with New Yorkers after 9/11 for my entire first term to rebuild.
0.0	0.527400361154	Sit down with people like Jeff Miller, the Republican chairman of the house, and work on a bill.
0.0	0.528915673907	I want to build on and improve the Affordable Care Act.
0.0	0.531639403901	And Teddy Roosevelt is right.
0.0	0.531913984033	That is why I support a $12 national federal minimum wage.
0.0	0.5327281857	John, I was the first person on this stage to say that we should accept the 65,000 Syrian refugees that were fleeing the sort of murder of ISIL, and I believe that that needs to be done with proper screening.
0.0	0.534906649672	I think that was one of the worst foreign policy blunders in the more than history of the United States.
0.0	0.534968183881	Check it out.
0.0	0.535217346067	As a former mayor and a former governor, there was never a single day, John, when I went to bed or woke up without realizing that this could happen in our own country.
0.0	0.535607810495	And ISIS, make no mistake about it, is an evil in this world.
0.0	0.535874455967	Why do -- why, over her political career has Wall Street been a major -- the major campaign contributor to Hillary Clinton?
0.0	0.536329781143	She's the senator from New York.
0.0	0.537568279279	Part of the problem that we have currently in the Middle East is that Assad has hung on to power with the very strong support of Russia and Iran and with the proxy of Hezbollah being there basically fighting his battles.
0.0	0.538136606294	We were attacked in downtown Manhattan where Wall Street is.
0.0	0.53835718236	If they hear people running for president who basically shortcut it to say we are somehow against Islam, that was one of the real contributions, despite all the other problems, that George W. Bush made after 9/11 when he basically said after going to a Mosque in Washington, we are not at war with Islam or Muslims.
0.0	0.539403233852	I have never heard a candidate never, who has received huge amounts of money from oil, from coal, from Wall Street, from the military industrial complex, not one candidate say, oh, these campaign contributions will not influence me.
0.0	0.54159243806	Bill after coming home from Japan, flying 33 missions.
0.0	0.543067195132	Together, leading the world, this country will rid our planet of this barbarous organization called ISIS.
0.0	0.54309962436	That's what I understand is the request from the international...
0.0	0.543905384953	But I believe coming from a state that has virtually no gun control, I believe that I am in position to reach out to the 60 or 70 percent of the American people who agree with us on those issues.
0.0	0.545417067582	In the last 30 years, there has been a massive redistribution of wealth.
0.0	0.546280084092	But at the end of the day, Nancy, here is the question -- in this great country of ours, with so much intelligence and so much capability, why do we remain the only major country on earth that does not guarantee health care to all people as a right?
0.0	0.547449527478	And a mom of a service member of ours who served two duties in Iraq said, Governor O' Malley, please, when you're with your other candidates and colleagues on stage, please don't use the term 'boots on the ground'.
0.0	0.54752817299	My proposal is tougher, more effective, and more comprehensive because I go after all of Wall Street not just the big banks.
0.0	0.547901324357	We have to go after what is called the shadow banking industry.
1.0	0.548337267434	John -- John, this country today has more income and wealth inequality than any major country on Earth.
0.0	0.548800569043	Let's reverse the immunity.
1.0	0.549145024714	Unfortunately, Nouri al-Maliki, the prime minister, set about decimating it.
0.0	0.549543295621	I think that is the number one requirement.
0.0	0.550183096176	I guess the one I -- I would pick is the fact that I was part of a very small group that had to advise the president about whether or not to go after Bin Laden.
0.0	0.550335639777	And I apologize to nobody for that.
0.0	0.550419382051	Look, I don't believe there's the model -- there's lots of good people that work in finance, Secretary Sanders, but Secretary Clinton, we need to step up and we need to protect Main Street from Wall Street and you can't do that by -- by campaigning as the candidate of Wall Street.
0.0	0.551219618615	You're seeing cities like San Francisco, cities like Los Angeles doing it, and they are doing it well and workers are able to have more disposable income.
0.0	0.551451345073	ISIS has now attacked a western democracy in -- in France.
0.0	0.553534246033	There are a lot of things we've got to do in our country, reigning in Wall Street is certainly one of them.
0.0	0.554849692215	Ultimately, we have got to say as a nation, Secretary Clinton, is health care a right of all people or is it not?
1.0	0.555059875279	We are relying on small campaign donors, 750,000 of them, 30 bucks a piece.
1.0	0.556229978601	The Republicans have voted to repeal it nearly 60 times.
0.0	0.559673025015	There were parts of that bill which agree with parts -- I disagree.
0.0	0.559793110208	I think she said something like the bulk of the responsibility is not ours.
0.0	0.561549831169	Well, why do they make millions of dollars of campaign contributions?
0.0	0.564084597669	Here is the major issue when we talk about Wall Street.
0.0	0.564481896672	I believe that our Federal Government needs to do more on pell grants.
0.0	0.565587761322	Why do we continue to get ripped off by the drug companies who can charge us any prices they want?
0.0	0.56577371608	So there's more to my plan than just the cap.
0.0	0.565794512821	I have made very clear that hardworking, middle-class families need a raise, not a tax increase.
0.0	0.566551694997	What the polls are showing is that we are actually defeating the secretary among younger people.
0.0	0.566841711036	It means that we end minimum sentencing for those people arrested.
0.0	0.567582627265	That's the future of banking in America.
0.0	0.568971335654	So, I think we've got to understand the complexity of the world that we are facing and no place is more so than in the Middle East.
0.0	0.570327438875	What my campaign is about is a political revolution -- millions of people standing up and saying, enough is enough.
0.0	0.571454003346	We actually did it.
0.0	0.571767059908	But at the end of the day, Wall Street today has enormous economic and political power.
0.0	0.571773349174	We are at war with violent extremism.
1.0	0.574015895675	We are the only major country on Earth that doesn't guarantee healthcare to all people.
0.0	0.574579269599	I don't think any -- I don't think any sensible person would disagree that the invasion of Iraq led to the massive level of instability we are seeing right now.
0.0	0.575287965632	I -- I said I made a mistake on Iraq, and I would love to see Senator Sanders join with some of my colleague in addition the Senate that I see in the audience.
0.0	0.578185128104	Where were we attacked?
0.0	0.57873331257	It will give hope to millions of young people.
1.0	0.579702319833	He's not wall street.
0.0	0.580523859459	America is best when we are actually standing up to evil in this world.
0.0	0.580720014906	You're seeing cities like Seattle.
0.0	0.581739620177	We ended up with 56 votes.
0.0	0.582797966059	Like we have a -- we have a lot of work to do and we're the only nation on the planet that buries as many of our people from gun violence as we do.
0.0	0.583319014095	I've laid out a very aggressive plan to reign in Wall Street -- not just the big banks.
0.0	0.584550271268	Our role in the world is to make ourselves a beacon of hope.
1.0	0.586607443252	7 percent and 8 percent to go to college?
0.0	0.587355946081	And we must substantially lower, as my legislation does, interest rates on student debt.
0.0	0.587853458149	And in that capacity, I met with just an extraordinary group of people from World War II, from korea, vietnam, all of the wars.
0.0	0.589185041334	It was country after country without making the investment in human intelligence to understand who the new leaders were and the new forces were that are coming up.
0.0	0.592647852745	It was an investment bank.
0.0	0.594835543978	Well, I think it's perfectly fair to say that we invested quite a bit in development aid.
0.0	0.595821246976	Just because this is not an esoteric argument.
0.0	0.595856218388	But we have to also go after the gun lobby and 92 percent of Americans agree we should have universal background checks.
0.0	0.597422526679	Yes, I do believe there must be a tax on Wall Street speculation.
0.0	0.597719089673	And we didn't put a single boot on the ground, and Gaddafi was deposed.
0.0	0.599643032363	We needed 60.
0.0	0.601741580882	Well, I think -- I think that is very unfair to a few you mentioned, most particularly Jordan, which has put a lot on the line for the United States, has also taken in hundreds of thousands of refugees from Syria, and has been, therefore, subjected to threats and attacks by extremists themselves.
0.0	0.601793548283	Kathie, that is the kind of economy I believe, put money in the hands of working people, raise the minimum wage to 15 buck an hour.
0.0	0.604293861427	Now, there has been a lot of turmoil and trouble as they have tried to deal with these radical elements which you find in this arc of instability, from north Africa to Afghanistan.
0.0	0.604526502978	We saw a Muslim brotherhood president installed, and then we saw him ousted and the army back.
0.0	0.605583517092	My daughters went to college on a mountain of bills.
0.0	0.606107806512	Well, in fact, I would argue that the disastrous invasion of Iraq, something that I strongly opposed, has unraveled the region completely and led to the rise of al-Qaeda and to ISIS.
0.0	0.606445845196	And I was determined to do everything that I could to make VA health care the best in the world, to expand benefits to the men and women who put their lives on the line to defending.
0.0	0.606690076427	Then, in 2008, you were portraying yourself as Annie Oakley and saying that we don't need those regulations on the federal level and now you're coming back around here.
0.0	0.608180985856	Of course, you would.
0.0	0.609074303303	And, of course, I met the mothers of Eric Garner and Tamir Rice, and Michael Brown and Trayvon Martin and so many of them who have lost their children.
