They would repeal the Affordable Care Act, not improve it.
They would give more tax breaks to the super-wealthy and corporations, not to the middle class.
And they would, despite all their tough talk about terrorism, continue to let people who are on the no-fly list buy guns.
There was a breach because the DNC vendor screwed up, information came to our campaign.
In this case, our staff did the wrong thing -- they looked a that information.
As soon as we learned that they looked at that information - we fired that person.
We are now doing an independent internal investigation to see who else was involved.
Fourthly, I work -- look forward to working with Secretary Clinton for an investigation, an independent investigation, about all of the breaches that have occurred from day one in this campaign, because I am not convinced that information from our campaign may not have ended up in her campaign.
This small country has welcomed in many refugees.
We lose 33,000 people a year already to gun violence, arming more people to do what I think is not the appropriate response to terrorism.
Senator Sanders voted against the Brady Bill.
Senator Sanders voted to give immunity to gun dealers.
And Senator Sanders voted against even research dollars to look into this public health issue.
Secretary Clinton changes her position on this every election year, it seems, having one position in 2000 and then campaigning against President Obama and saying we don't need federal standards.
ISIL videos, ISIL training videos are telling lone wolves the easiest way to buy a combat assault weapon in America is at a gun show.
In 1988, just to set the record straight governor, I ran for the U.S. House.
One candidate said, you know what, I don't think it's a great idea that we sell automatic weapons in this country that are used by the military to kill people very rapidly.
Gun people said, there were three candidates in the race, you vote for one of the others, but not Bernie Sanders.
I lost that election by three percentage points.
They are going to people showing videos of Donald Trump insulting Islam and Muslims in order to recruit more radical jihadists.
I think it's fair to say, Assad has killed, by last count, about 250,000 Syrians.
The reason we are in the mess we're in, that ISIS has the territory it has, is because of Assad.
Middle class in this country for the last 40 years has been disappearing; are we better of today then we were when Bush left office?
But as you've indicated for millions of American workers, people in New Hampshire -- all over America, they're working longer hours for lower wages deeply worried about their kids.
Women should not be making 79 cents on the dollar compared to that.
I think it's great standing up here with the senator and the governor talking about these issues, because you're not going to hear anything like this from any of the Republicans who are running for president.
And the worst type of concentration, Secretary Clinton, is the concentration of the big banks, the big six banks that you went to and spoke to and told them, oh, you weren't responsible for the crash, not by a long shot.
Secondly, I think it's important to point out that about 3 percent of my donations come from people in the finance and investment world.
I have more donations from students and teachers than I do from people associated with Wall Street.
Well, I would certainly build on the successes of the Affordable Care Act and work to fix some of the glitches that you just referenced.
I can tell you that adding up the fact you're not paying any private insurance, businesses are not paying any private insurance.
The average middle-class family will be saving thousands of dollars a year.
The cost of college education is escalating a lot faster than the cost of inflation.
Number one, States have been dis-investing in higher education.
In fact, I think New Hampshire, in state tuition for public colleges and universities, is among the highest if not the highest in the country.
So states over a period of decades have put their money elsewhere; into prisons, into highways, into things other than higher education.
When I ran in 1999, David, for mayor of Baltimore, our city by that year had become the most addicted, violent, and abandoned in America.
And we were able to put our city on the path for the biggest reduction in crime of any major city in America over the next ten years.
People are pouring across the southern border.
Drugs will not pour through that wall.
We need to embed our forces -- our troops inside the Iraqi military.
And even worse, President Obama and Hillary Clinton are proposing bringing tens of thousands of Syrian refugees to this country when the head of the FBI has told Congress they cannot vet those refugees.
Soon after 9/11, I got a phone call from the NSA.
They needed help.
I gave them help.
I stopped a truckload of equipment.
I had it turned around.
But they must be engaged, and they must be asked.
Number one, it ended the federal government's bulk collection of phone metadata of millions of law-abiding citizens.
It strengthened the tools of national security and law enforcement to go after terrorists.
It gave us greater tools and we are seeing those tools work right now in San Bernardino.
And in particular, what it did is the prior program only covered a relatively narrow slice of phone calls.
When you had a terrorist, you could only search a relatively narrow slice of numbers, primarily land lines.
The USA Freedom Act expands that so now we have cell phones, now we have Internet phones, now we have the phones that terrorists are likely to use and the focus of law enforcement is on targeting the bad guys.
And that tool we lost, the metadata program, was a valuable tool that we no longer have at our disposal.
Once again, Marco opposed this.
He is the one for an open border that is leaving us defenseless.
They do not need to be forced.
They need to be asked to bring the best and brightest, the most recent technology to the table.
I was asked as a CEO.
But they have not been asked.
That's why it cost billions of dollars to build an Obama website that failed because the private sector wasn't asked.
What it means is using overwhelming air power to utterly and completely destroy ISIS.
To put things in perspective, in the first Persian Gulf War, we launched roughly 1,100 air attacks a day.
We carpet bombed them for 36 days, saturation bombing, after which our troops went in and in a day and a half mopped up what was left of the Iraqi army.
We didn't monitor the Facebook posting of the female San Bernardino terrorist because the Obama DHS thought it would be inappropriate.
She made a public call to jihad, and they didn't target it.
You would carpet bomb where ISIS is, not a city, but the location of the troops.
There were numerous people, including the mother, that knew what was going on.
When you had the World Trade Center go, people were put into planes that were friends, family, girlfriends, and they were put into planes and they were sent back, for the most part, to Saudi Arabia.
Look, two months ago Donald Trump said that ISIS was not our fight.
Just two months ago he said that Hillary Clinton would be a great negotiator with Iran.
Every one was retired early because they told President Obama things that he didn't want to hear.
But I will tell you this, when I stand across from King Hussein of Jordan and I say to him, "You have a friend again sir, who will stand with you to fight this fight," he'll change his mind.
Once again, the Obama administration, encouraged by Republicans, toppled Mubarak who had been a reliable ally of the United States, of Israel, and in its place, Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood came in, a terrorist organization.
These moderate rebels end up being jihadists.
We've spent $3 trillion and probably much more - I have no idea what we've spent.
I know Vladimir Putin.
And, you know, one of the most troubling aspects of the Rubio-Schumer Gang of Eight Bill was that it gave President Obama blanket authority to admit refugees, including Syrian refugees without mandating any background checks whatsoever.
Ted, you support legalizing people who are in this country illegally.
Ted Cruz supported a 500-percent increase in the number of H-1 visas, the guest workers that are allowed into this country, and Ted supports doubling the number of green cards.
I have never supported legalization, and I do not intend to support legalization.
Do you know how many aliens Bill Clinton deported?
12 million.
Do you know how many illegal aliens, George W. Bush deported?
10 million.
On September 10th, 2001, I was named chief federal prosecutor in New Jersey and on September 11th, 2001, my wife and my brother who are in the audience tonight went through the World Trade Center and to their offices just blocks away from the Trade Center.
And yet they are seeing almost all new income and all new wealth going to the top 1 percent.
They see more people in jail in the United States of America than any other country on earth, 2.2 million.
We're spending $80 billion a year locking up fellow Americans.
Americans haven't had a raise in 15 years.
There aren't enough good-paying jobs, especially for young people.
Twenty-nine million people have no health insurance today in America.
We pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.
One out of five Americans can't even afford the prescriptions their doctors are writing.
My price tag is about $100 billion a year.
And again, paid for.
And let us be clear that every proposal that I have introduced has been paid for.
Who denies that real unemployment today, including those who have given up looking for work and are working part-time is close to 10 percent?
Who denies that African-American youth unemployment, real, is over 50 percent.
I'm very proud that I support legislation that is currently in the Congress, got support of almost all progressive Democrats in the House and Senate, which says we will end the absurdity of women today making 79 cents on the dollar compared to men.
When we have more people in jail, disproportionately African American and Latino, than China does, a communist authoritarian society four times our size.
I think under President Obama we have seen a lot of advances, the Affordable Care Act has helped more African Americans than any other group to get insurance, to be taken care of, but we also know a lot more than we did.
As I understand it, the African-American community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse.
We have the highest rate of childhood poverty among almost any major country on Earth.
I have long supported the proposition that we should lift the cap on taxable income coming into the Social Security Trust Fund, starting at $250,000.
We do what the American people want, to expand Social Security by $1,300 a year for people under $16,000, and we extend the life of Social Security for 58 years.
And in Libya, for example, the United States, Secretary Clinton, as secretary of state, working with some other countries, did get rid of a terrible dictator named Gadhafi.
Mossadegh back in 1953.
Nobody knows who Mossadegh was, democratically-elected prime minister of Iran.
One, Senator Sanders voted in 1998 on what I think is fair to call a regime change resolution with respect to Iraq, calling for the end of Saddam Hussein's regime.
He voted in favor of regime change with Libya, voted in favor of the Security Council being an active participate in setting the parameters for what we would do, which of course we followed through on.
But more importantly, in terms of this Libya resolution that you have noted before, this was a virtually unanimous consent.
Everybody voted for it wanting to see Libya move toward democracy, of course we all wanted to do that.
But I want to -- I want to follow up on something having to do with leadership, because, you know, today Senator Sanders said that President Obama failed the presidential leadership test.
And this is not the first time that he has criticized President Obama.
In the past he has called him weak.
He has called him a disappointment.
He wrote a forward for a book that basically argued voters should have buyers' remorse when it comes to President Obama's leadership and legacy.
When President Obama came into office we were losing 800,000 jobs a month, 800,000 jobs a month.
We had a $1.4 trillion deficit.
The blurb said that the next president of the United States has got to be aggressive in bringing people into the political process.
You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don't agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements.
But we have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977.
Median wages have stagnated.
And I've done it when I was in Washington when we had a balanced budget; had four years of balanced budgets; paid down a half-trillion of debt.
And if you tax cuts -- if you cut taxes for corporations, and you cut taxes for individuals, you're going to make things move, particularly the corporate tax, which is the highest, of course, in the -- in the world.
Someone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander in chief and someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi can never be president of the United States.
We have the world's best military, even though he's done everything he can to diminish it.
When I look at the migration, I looked at the line, I said it actually on your show recently, where are the women?
It looked like very few women.
Very few children.
Strong, powerful men, young and people are looking at that and they're saying what's going on?
He put a 25 million dollar check up from his own pocket to fund that campaign and my wife Heidi and I, we ended up investing everything we owned.
Under longstanding U.S. law, the child of a U.S. citizen born abroad is a natural-born citizen.
Our military is a disaster.
This president is undermining our military.
First of all, I didn't support Sonia Sotomayor.
Secondly, I never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
Third, if you look at my record as governor of New Jersey, I have vetoed a 50-caliber rifle ban.
I have vetoed a reduction this clip size.
I vetoed a statewide I.D. system for gun owners and I pardoned, six out-of-state folks who came through our state and were arrested for owning a gun legally in another state so they never have to face charges.
And on Common Core, Common Core has been eliminated in New Jersey.
I'll tell you what else they're upset about: you're 50 or 51 years old, and some kid walks in and tells you you're out of work, and you don't know where to go and where to turn.
Well, there's not question that we should be able to look at past president whether they're married to somebody who's running for president or not in terms of their past behavior and what it means.
Look, I have an A plus rating in the NRA and we also have a reduction in gun violence because in Florida, if you commit a crime with a gun, you're going away.
Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan.
And the reason I said that is because the FBI director told the American people, told Congress, that he could not guarantee he could vet them and it would be safe.
That's wrong.
They were wrong.
Let's not have the most expensive business tax rate in the world.
If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world -- and we double tax, as you know.
And what that's led to over $2 trillion of American companies' monies that are being kept offshore, because they don't want to pay the second tax.
They don't want to pay 35 percent tax on the way back.
Ronald Regan opposed the value tax because he said it was a way to blindfold the people, so the true cost of government was not there there for them.
Well, Marco has been floating this attack for a few weeks now, but the problem is, the business flat tax in my proposal is not a vat.
A vat is imposed as a sales tax when you buy a good.
I would note that Art Laffer, Ronald Reagan's chief economic adviser, has written publicly, that my simple flat tax is the best tax plan of any of the individuals on this stage cause it produces economic growth, it raises wages and it helps everyone from the very poorest to the very richest.
It is also the case that that Rubio-Schumer amnesty bill, one of the things it did is it expanded Barack Obama's power to let in Syrian refugees.
It enabled him -- the president to certify them en masse without mandating meaningful background checks.
Ted Cruz, you used to say you supported doubling the number of green cards, now you say that you're against it.
You used to support a 500 percent increase in the number of guest workers, now you say that you're against it.
You used to support legalizing people that were here illegally, now you say you're against it.
You used to say that you were in favor of birthright citizenship, now you say that you are against it.
They were watching the humiliation of our young ten sailors, sitting on the floor with their knees in a begging position, their hands up.
And Iranian wise guys having guns to their heads.
The state should also be sending money immediately to help this city.
You are paying three times more for poison water than I am paying in Burlington, Vermont for clean water.
First thing is you say, people are not paying a water bill for poison and that is retroactive.
We have a higher rate of tested lead in people in Cleveland than in Flint.
I want us to have an absolute commitment to getting rid of lead wherever it is because it's not only in water systems, it's also in soil, and it's in lead paint that is found mostly in older homes.
That's why 500,000 children today have lead -- lead in their bodies.
We will commit to a priority to change the water systems, and we will commit within five years to remove lead from everywhere.
I am also going to go after companies like Johnson Controls in Wisconsin.
They came and got part of the bailout because they were an auto parts supplier and now they want to move headquarters to Europe.
Secretary Clinton supported virtually every one of the disastrous trade agreements written by corporate America.
NAFTA, supported by the Secretary cost, us 800,000 jobs nationwide, tens of thousands of jobs in the Midwest.
Permanent normal trade relations with China cost us millions of jobs.
He was against the auto bailout.
I voted to save the auto industry.
... to set the record straight, I voted against the only multinational trade agreement that came before me when I was in the Senate.
I came out against the TPP after it was finished.
I thought it was reasonable to actually know what was in it before I opposed it.
I told them they were wrecking the economy.
I asked for a moratorium on foreclosures.
I asked that we do more to try to prevent what I worried was going to happen.
I also called for closing loopholes including the carried interest loophole.
I also called for changes in CEO pay.
And you know what, if you were going to be in some way distrusted or dismissed about whether you can take on Wall Street if you ever took money, President Obama took more money from Wall Street in the 2008 campaign than anybody ever had.
You know, on average, 90 people a day are killed by gun violence in our country.
Because it removed any accountability from the makers and the sellers.
So that is an issue that Senator Sanders and I differ on, I voted against giving them immunity, but I think we should very seriously move to repeal that and go back to making sure gun makers and sellers are like any other business.
I have a D minus voting record from the NRA.
You are looking at a guy who in 1988 lost a statewide election for Congress because I was the only candidate who said you know what, I don't think it's a great idea in this country to be selling military-style assault weapons which are designed to kill people.
I lost that election by three votes.
No other industry in America has absolute immunity...
But where we are right now is having more than 2.2 million people in jail -- more than any other country on earth.
This is a campaign promise, at the end of my first term, we will not have more people in jail than any other country.
What it says among other things, 51 percent of African-American kids today are unemployed -- you know we're going to do?
So to answer your question, I would say, and I think it's similar to what the secretary said, when you're white, you don't know what it's like to be living in a ghetto.
You don't know what it's like to be poor.
And what that legislation ended up doing is increasing extreme poverty, the poorest people in this country have become much poorer as a result of that -- really a bill that was written by Republicans.
... Anderson, not only do we have a crumbling school system in Detroit, and in many other areas, we have -- and everybody in this room should be embarrassed by this, we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on Earth.
And what they are telling me -- if we don't get our act together, this planet could be 5 to 10 degrees warmer by the end of this century -- cataclysmic problems for this planet.
And I talk to scientists who tell me that fracking is doing terrible things to water systems all over this country.
A lot of money from Wall Street and from the fossil fuel industry.
I have 5 million individual contributors who have gone to BernieSanders.com to make a $27 contribution.
I don't take money from the fossil fuel industry.
I would love to run against Donald Trump, and I'll tell you why.
I have not insulted Donald personally and I don't intend to.
And then in Ohio, of course, I had to bring about big reform, again, because we were so far in the hole and now we just found out we are up over 400,000 jobs since I took over as governor.
When that war began, we had 8,000 planes.
Today, we have about 4,000.
When that war began, we had 529 ships.
Today, we have 272.
Look at the attack they inspired in Philadelphia, that the White House still refuses to link to terror, where a guy basically shot a police officer three times.
He told the police, "I did it because I was inspired by ISIS," and to this day, the White House still refuses to acknowledge it had anything to do with terror.
What those facts knew was that these folks had weapons.
They knew that they were talking about trying to take our country and attack it.
It is the biggest job-killer in this country.
Millions of Americans have lost their jobs, have been forced into part-time work, have lost their health insurance, have lost their doctors, have seen their premiums skyrocket.
And, it says blanket amnesty, I do not support blanket amnesty...
It absolutely has been, and at the time in the context of that was in 2009, and 2010, where the last effort for legalization was an effort done in the Senate.
It was an effort led by several people that provided almost an instant path with very little obstacles moving forward.
Barack Obama actually had the poison pill to stop it then.
You know, the amendment you're talking about is one sentence -- it's 38 words.
In those 38 words, it said anyone here illegally is permanently ineligible for citizenship.
It didn't say a word about legalization.
She wants to put Barack Obama on the Supreme Court of the United States of America.
She said that here in Iowa just two days ago.
And then we decided we could bring $14 billion of our money -- I mean, Washington doesn't have any money.
We've got to end this rigged economy where people are working longer hours for low wages, almost all new income and wealth going to the top 1 percent, and of course, we need comprehensive immigration reform and a path toward citizenship.
It was not prohibited.
It was not in any way disallowed.
And as I have said and as now has come out, my predecessors did the same thing and many other people in the government.
And some other parts of the government, we're not exactly sure who, has concluded that some of the emails should be now retroactively classified.
They've just said the same thing to former Secretary Colin Powell.
They have said, we're going to retroactively classify emails you sent personally.
Now I think he was right when he said this is an absurdity.
Poverty is increasing.
Well, when we talk about efforts to assist immigrants, Secretary Clinton prevailed upon the governor of New York, Elliot Spitzer, who wanted to do the right thing and provide driver's license to these who were undocumented, she said don't do it, and New York State still does not do it.
And I said welcome those children into this country, Secretary Clinton said send them back.
And in 2006, when Senator Sanders was running for the Senate from Vermont, he voted in the House with hard-line Republicans for indefinite detention for undocumented immigrants, and then he sided with those Republicans to stand with vigilantes known as Minute Men who were taking up outposts along the border to hunt down immigrants.
And as I said earlier, in 2006, Senator Sanders supported indefinite detention for people facing deportation...
...and stood with the Minutemen vigilantes in their ridiculous, absurd efforts to, quote, "hunt down immigrants.
There was a piece of legislation supported by dozens and dozens of members of the House which codified existing legislation.
No, I did not oppose the bailout or the support of the automobile industry.
But the fact is the money that rescued the auto industry was in that bill.
And the result is that we have the most secure border we've ever had.
Apprehensions coming across the border are the lowest they've been in 40 years, which just strengthens my argument that now it's time to do comprehensive immigration reform.
I went to Wall Street before the Great Recession and basically called them out, said that their behavior was putting our economy at risk, called for a moratorium on foreclosures.
Look, clearly, clearly, the secretary's words to Wall Street has really intimidated them, and that is why they have given her $15 million in campaign contributions.
It is a record of achievement for veterans, working with Republicans, helping to craft the most significant veterans healthcare bill passed in many decades.
One of the points that I've been making, and media does not seem to pick up on it, is that we have a real crisis not only with real unemployment in America being close to 10 percent, but youth unemployment in this country.
And right now, I go around asking people at my events if they know what their interest rate is and the interest rates literally go from like 8 percent to 14 percent.
It's outrageous that at a time when interest rates have been historically low, people borrowing money to invest in their education are paying some of the highest interest rates around.
And by the way, everybody, who, quote, "got money" in the quote, "bailout", that also included money for the auto rescue has paid it back.
So, the Treasury was out nothing.
Now that will no longer happen because we have Dodd-Frank and we will break up banks that pose a systemic threat to our economy.
One out of five Americans cannot afford the prescription drugs their doctors prescribe.
The clean power plan is something that Senator Sanders has said he would delay implementing, which makes absolutely no sense.
Throughout the history of our relationship with Latin America we've operated under the so-called Monroe Doctrine, and that said the United States had the right do anything that they wanted to do in Latin America.
So I actually went to Nicaragua and I very shortly opposed the Reagan administration's efforts to overthrow that government.
And I strongly opposed earlier Henry Kissinger and the -- to overthrow the government of Salvador Aliende (ph) in Chile.
...on the other hands, it would be wrong not to state that in Cuba they have made some good advances in health care.
They are sending doctors all over the world.
Because let's remember three words: Bush versus Gore.
A court took away a presidency.
Now we've got the Republican Congress trying to take away the constitution.
And that is, is it acceptable that in America the top 0.1 percent now owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent.
Is it acceptable that while the average American works longer hours for lower wages, 58 percent of all new income is going to the top 1 percent.
It's important to be qualified, but if this election is a resume competition, then Hillary Clinton's gonna be the next president, because she's been in office and in government longer than anybody else running here tonight.
I cut taxes every year, totaling $19 billion.
And the net effect was, during my eight years, 1.3 million jobs were created.
We came in, we balanced an $11 billion deficit on a $29 billion budget by cutting over 800 programs in the state budget.
We brought the budget into balance with no tax increases.
In fact, we vetoed five income tax increases during my time as governor.
We cut business taxes $2.3 billion, and we cut regulation by one-third of what my predecessor put in place.
Unlike Hillary Clinton, who has a radical position in terms of support for Planned Parenthood, I defunded Planned Parenthood more than four years ago, long before any of these videos came out...
And finally, our Medicaid is growing at one of the lowest rates in the country.
And, finally, we went from $8 billion in the hole to $2 billion in the black.
We've cut $5 billion in taxes...
This was not a subject that was on anybody's mind until I brought it up at my announcement.
And I said, Mexico is sending.
And they send the bad ones over because they don't want to pay for them.
Now, he's got his solutions.
Some of us have other solutions.
You know, look, I balanced the federal budget as one of the chief architects when I was in Washington.
I was a military reformer.
I took the state of Ohio from an $8 billion hole and a 350,000 job loss to a $2 billion surplus and a gain of 350,000 jobs.
This is the most generous country in the world when it comes to immigration.
There are a million people a year who legally immigrate to the United States, and people feel like we're being taken advantage of.
A majority of the candidates on this stage have supported amnesty.
I have never supported amnesty, and I led the fight against Chuck Schumer's gang of eight amnesty legislation in the Senate.
I was appointed U.S. attorney by President Bush on September 10th, 2001, and the world changed enormously the next day, and that happened in my state.
The Fourth Amendment was what we fought the Revolution over!
John Adams said it was the spark that led to our war for independence, and I'm proud of standing for the Bill of Rights, and I will continue to stand for the Bill of Rights.
Our graduation rate improved by 50 percent.
Because today in America, a third of our kids, after we spend more per student than any country in the world other than a couple rounding errors, to be honest with you, 30 percent are college- and/or career-ready.
Before I came in, the unemployment rate was over eight percent.
It's now down to 4.6 percent.
We've more than made up for the jobs that were lost during the recession.
And the rate in which people are working is almost five points higher than it is nationally.
And, if Congress wants to mess with the retirement program, why don't we let them start by changing their retirement program, and not have one, instead of talking about getting rid of Social Security and Medicare that was robbed $700 billion dollars to pay for Obamacare.
One of the reasons that Social Security is in so much trouble is that the only funding stream comes from people who get a wage.
The people who get wages is declining dramatically.
The fact is, I built a net worth of more than $10 billion.
20 -- over 40 percent of small and mid-size banks that loan money to small businesses have been wiped out over the -- since Dodd-Frank has passed.
I have never said that.
And I have never advocated that.
Our Navy is at its smallest size since 1917; our Air Force, since 1940.
In recent testimony, the commandant of the Marine Corps said half of the non-deployed units were not ready and you know, the sequester is cutting the heart out of our personnel.
You know, Ukraine was a nuclear-armed state.
They gave away their nuclear arms with the understanding that we would protect them.
I have a D-minus voting record from the NRA.
I was in 1988, there were three candidates running for congress in the state of Vermont, I stood up to the gun lobby and came out and maintained the position that in this country we should not be selling military style assault weapons.
I have supported from day one and instant background check to make certain that people who should have guns do not have guns.
And that includes people of criminal backgrounds, people who are mentally unstable.
Yes look, I have made it clear based on Senator Sanders' own record that he has voted with the NRA, with the gun lobby numerous times.
He voted against the Brady Bill five times.
He voted for what we call, the Charleston Loophole.
He voted for immunity from gunmakers and sellers which the NRA said, "was the most important piece of gun legislation in 20 years. "
He voted to let guns go onto the Amtrak, guns go into National Parks.
He voted against doing research to figure out how we can save lives.
Let's not forget what this is about, 90 people a day die from gun violence in our country.
That's 33,000 people a year.
There is no other industry in America that was given the total pass that the gun makers and dealers were and that needs to be reversed.
One out of three African American men may well end up going to prison.
This is a responsibility for the U.S. Justice Department to get involved.
