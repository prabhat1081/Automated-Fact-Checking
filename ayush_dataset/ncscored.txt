0.13 It's good to be with you.
0.80 After those four years of looking back and being prepared, the preparation to be the most powerful individual in the world requires an extraordinary amount of work: not just having been the governor of the 12th largest economy in the world, which I might add, we added 1.5 million jobs during that period of time over that 2007 through 2014 period, a period when America was going through the most deep recession it had been through since the Great Depression.
0.20 I think Americans want someone to have a track record of showing them how to get this country back on record, someone who will stand up and every day project that best days of America are in front of us.
0.28 And I will assure you, as the governor of the state of Texas, and as those last four years have shown me, the preparation to be ready to stand on this stage and talk about those monetary policies, those domestic policies, and those foreign policies, Americans are going to see that I am ready to be that individual.
0.18 Well, when you look at the celebrity of Donald Trump, then I think that says a lot about it.
0.53 One thing I like to remind people is, back in 2007, Rudy Giuliani was leading the polls for almost a year.
0.22 I'll suggest a part of that was his celebrity.
0.39 Fred Thompson was the other one, a man who had spent a lot of time on that screen.
0.21 I've had my issues with Donald Trump.
0.38 I talked about Donald Trump from the standpoint of being an individual who was using his celebrity rather than his conservatism.
0.19 How can you run for the Republican nomination and be for single- payer health care?
0.30 I mean, I ask that with all due respect.
0.62 And nobody, nobody on either one of these stages has done more than I've done and the people of the State of Texas to deal with securing that border.
0.46 We sent our Texas ranger recon teams.
0.34 We sent our parks and wildlife wardens.
0.62 I deployed the National Guard after I stood on the ramp in Dallas, Texas and looked the president of the United States in the eye and said, "Mr. President, if you won't secure the border, Texas will," and that's exactly what we did.
0.19 We need a president that doesn't just talk a game, but a president that's got real results.
0.27 Bill, here's the interesting position on this.
0.30 Americans are tired of hearing this debate -- want to go to, what are you going to do about illegal immigration?
0.30 For 30 years this country has been baited with that.
0.69 All the way back to when Ronald Reagan signed a piece of legislation that basically allowed for amnesty for over 4 million people, and the border is still not secure.
0.27 The American people are never going to trust Washington, D.C., and for good reason.
0.14 We hear all this discussion about well, I would do this, or I would do that, when the fact is, the border is still porous.
0.58 Until we have a president of the United States that gets up every day and goes to the Oval Office with the intent purpose of securing that border, and there's not anybody on either one of these stages that has the experience of dealing with this as I have for over 14 years with that 1200-mile border.
0.58 We have to put the personnel on that border in the right places; you have to put the strategic fencing in place; and you have to have aviation assets that fly all the way from Tijuana to El Paso to Brownsville, Texas -- 1,933 miles looking down 24/7, with the technology to be able to identify what individuals are doing, and ID when they are in obviously illegal activities or suspicious activities, and quick response teams come.
0.29 At that particular point in time, then Americans will believe that Washington is up to a conversation to deal with the millions of people that are here illegally, but not until.
0.23 If you elect me president of the United States, I will secure that southern border.
0.26 We need to be on the side that keeps Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.
0.17 That's the side we need to be on, and that's the side of the bulk of the -- of the Middle East.
0.17 We need to have some coalitions in that part of the world to go after ISIS, but we also need to send a clear message.
0.19 And hopefully -- you know, Senator Graham, I -- I know where he's going to be on this, but we use Congress, and we use Congress to cut this funding.
0.71 One of the great challenges that we have, $150 billion is fixing to go to a country that killed our Marines in Lebanon, that used their weapons to kill our young men in Iran.
0.25 And the idea that this negotiation -- I will tell you one thing.
0.44 I would a whole lot rather had Carly Fiorina over there doing our negotiation than John Kerry.
0.18 Maybe we would've gotten a deal where we didn't give everything away.
0.30 But the issue for us is to have a Congress that stands up and says not only no, but "Hell no" to this money going to a regime that is going to use it for terror, Susan Rice has said that, and we need to stand up and strongly and clearly tell the ayatollah that -- whoever the next president of the United States is going to be, and I'll promise you, if it's me, the first thing that I will do is tear up that agreement with Iran.
0.30 It'll be a pretty busy day, but that Iran negotiation is going to be torn up on day one.
0.41 We're going to start the process of securing that border.
0.24 I'm also going to take a bottle of White-Out with me to get started on all those executive orders that Mr. Obama has put his name to.
0.25 Well, let's go with three.
0.18 Good at email.
0.09 Well, this is going to be a show me, don't tell me election.
0.16 I think America is just a few good decisions and a leadership change at the top away from the best years we've ever had.
0.48 And I think that the record of the governor of the last 14 years of the 12th largest economy in the world is just the medicine America is looking for.
0.30 Americans are looking for somebody that's going to give them, and there is a place in this country over the last eight years in particular that talked about hope every day, and they didn't just talk about it, they delivered it.
0.52 And that was the state of Texas.
0.38 And if we can do that in Texas, that 12th largest economy in the world, we can do it in America.
0.19 Our best days are in front of us.
0.24 We can reform those entitlements, we can change that corporate tax code and lower it.
0.30 We can put America back on track on a growth level and a growth rate that we've never seen in the history of this country.
0.21 Manufacturing will flow back into this country.
0.22 It just needs a corporate executive type at the top that's done it before.
0.20 And I will suggest to you nobody's done it like Rick Perry has done it over the last eight years.
0.15 And if you elect me president, we will bring incredible growth back to this country.
0.25 And as someone who's worn the uniform of the country, that's how we build our military back up.
0.31 Well, I would begin by reminding people that at this point in previous presidential elections, Jimmy Carter couldn't win, Ronald Reagan couldn't win, Bill Clinton couldn't win, and neither could've Barack Obama.
0.67 I started as a secretary and became ultimately the chief executive of the largest technology company in the world, almost $90 billion in over 150 countries.
0.11 I know personally how extraordinary and unique this nation is.
0.45 I think to be commander in chief in the 21st century requires someone who understands how the economy works, someone who understands how the world works and who's in it; I know more world leaders on the stage today than anyone running, with the possible exception of Hillary Clinton; understands bureaucracies, how to cut them down to size and hold them accountable; and understands technology, which is a tool, but it's also a weapon that's being used against us.
0.16 Most importantly, I think I understand leadership, which sometimes requires a tough call in a tough time.
0.29 But mostly, the highest calling of leadership is to challenge the status-quo and unlock the potential of others.
0.14 We need a leader who will lead the resurgence of this great nation and unlock its potential once again.
0.09 Well, I don't know.
0.37 I didn't get a phone call from Bill Clinton before I jumped in the race.
0.37 Did any of you get a phone call from Bill Clinton?
0.26 I didn't.
0.27 Maybe it's because I hadn't given money to the foundation or donated to his wife's Senate campaign.
0.16 Here's the thing that I would ask Donald Trump in all seriousness.
0.23 He is the party's frontrunner right now, and good for him.
0.14 I think he's tapped into an anger that people feel.
0.20 They're sick of politics as usual.
0.20 You know, whatever your issue, your cause, the festering problem you hoped would resolved, the political class has failed you.
0.24 That's just a fact, and that's what Donald Trump taps into.
0.15 I would also just say this.
0.56 Since he has changed his mind on amnesty, on health care and on abortion, I would just ask, what are the principles by which he will govern?Let me say first that it is disturbing that every time one of these home-grown terrorist attacks occurs, and, as your question points out, they are occurring with far too great frequency, it turns out we had warning signals.
0.16 It turns out we knew something was wrong.
0.33 It turns out some dot wasn't connected, and so the first thing we have to do is make sure that everyone and every responsible agency is attuned to all of these possibilities and symptoms.
0.47 We even had warnings about the Boston Marathon bombers, and yet the dots weren't connected.
0.11 So we need to get on a different mindset.
0.19 Secondly, I certainly support that we need to tear down cyber walls, not on a mass basis, but on a targeted basis.
0.36 But let me just say that we also need down -- to tear down the cyber walls that China is erecting, that Russia is erecting.
0.25 We need to be very well aware of the fact that China and Russia are using technology to attack us, just as ISIS is using technology to recruit those who would murder American citizens.
0.17 I do not believe that we need to wholesale destroy every American citizen's privacy in order to go after those that we know are suspect or are -- are already a problem.
0.41 But yes, there is more collaboration required between private sector companies and the public sector.
0.35 And specifically, we know that we could have detected and repelled some of these cyber attacks if that collaboration had been permitted.
0.42 A law has been sitting -- languishing, sadly, on Capitol Hill and has not yet been passed, and it would help.
0.21 I absolutely would call on them to collaborate and cooperate, yes.
0.19 Yeah.
0.18 Sometimes it's a complicated situation, but some things are black and white.
0.24 On day one in the Oval Office, I would make two phone calls.
0.39 The first one would be to my good friend, Bibi Netanyahu, to reassure him we will stand with the State of Israel.
0.24 The second will be to the supreme leader of Iran.
0.19 He might not take my phone call, but he would get the message, and the message is this: Until you open every nuclear and every military facility to full, open, anytime/anywhere, for real, inspections, we are going to make it as difficult as possible for you to move money around the global financial system.
0.22 I hope Congress says no to this deal.
0.25 But realistically, even if they do, the money is flowing.
0.29 China and Russia have never been on our side of the table.
0.27 The Europeans have moved on.
0.22 We have to stop the money flow.
0.25 And by the way, as important as those two phone calls are, they are also very important because they say this.
0.15 America is back in the leadership business.
0.17 And when America does not lead, the world is a dangerous and a tragic place.
0.20 This is a bad deal.
0.41 Obama broke every rule of negotiation.
0.32 Yes, our allies are not perfect.
0.38 But Iran is at the heart of most of the evil that is going on in the Middle East through their proxies.
0.17 Let me tell you what I would do immediately, day two in the Oval Office.
0.12 I would hold a Camp David summit with our Arab allies, not to talk them into this lousy deal with Iran, but to say to them, "what is it that you need to defeat ISIL?
0.35 "You know, Obama has presented the American people with a false choice every time.
0.21 It's what I've done or not done, or it's war.
0.25 It is a false choice.
0.27 King Abdullah of Jordan, a man I've known for a long time, has been asking for bombs and materiel.
0.31 We have not provided them.
0.32 He has gone to China.
0.44 The Kurds have been asking us to arm them for three years.
0.21 We haven't done so.
0.35 The Egyptians have asked us to share intelligence.
0.30 We're not doing it.
0.25 We have Arab allies.
0.25 They are not perfect.
0.20 I know every one.
0.15 But they need to see leadership, support and resolve from the United States of America, and we can help them defeat ISIS.I agree with my colleagues.
0.33 We need to begin by undoing -- I would begin by undoing a whole set of things that President Obama has done, whether it's illegal amnesty or this latest round of EPA regulations.
0.09 But let me go back to something that's very important.
0.25 We have been debating right here the core difference between conservatism and progressivism.
0.23 Conservatives, I am a conservative because I believe no one of us is any better than any other one of us.
0.35 Every one of us is gifted by God, whether it is those poor babies being picked over or it's someone whose life is tangled up in a web of dependence.
0.12 Progressives don't believe that.
0.18 They believe some are smarter than others, some are better than others, so some are going to need to take care of others.
0.31 That is the fight we have to have, and we have to undo a whole set of things that President Obama has done that get at the heart of his disrespect and disregard for too many Americans.
0.19 This is a great nation.
0.32 It is a unique nation in all of human history and on the face of the planet, because here, our founders believed that everyone has a right to fulfill their potential and that that right --they called it life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness -- comes from God and cannot be taken away by government.
0.34 We have arrived at a point in our nation's history where the potential of this nation and too many Americans is being crushed by the weight, the power, the cost, the complexity, the ineptitude, the corruption of the federal government, and only someone who will challenge the status quo of Washington, D.C. can lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.29 Hillary Clinton lies about Benghazi, she lies about e- mails.
0.26 She is still defending Planned Parenthood, and she is still her party's frontrunner.
0.29 2016 is going to be a fight between conservatism, and a Democrat party that is undermining the very character of this nation.
0.13 We need a nominee who is going to throw every punch, not pull punches, and someone who cannot stumble before he even gets into the ring.
0.18 I am not a member of the political class.
0.07 I am a conservative; I can win this job, I can do this job, I need your help, I need your support.
0.22 I will, with your help and support, lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.41 I would say the message that got us the win in Iowa and 10 other states against pretty overwhelming odds, is the message that's going to deliver us in this election.
0.28 I've got a track record.
0.27 The reason I did so well last time is not just because of the vision, it's because I have a track record in Washington, D.C. of getting things done.
0.54 Iran sanctions -- the Iran sanctions that brought them to the table, those are sanctions that we put in place when I was in the United States Senate, and a whole host of other things that put me in a position of saying, I not only have a great vision, but I can govern effectively in Washington.
0.28 My father was born in Italy, and shortly after he was born my grandfather immigrated to this country.
0.43 And under the laws of this country, he wasn't allowed to be with his father for seven years.
0.44 Spent the first seven years of his life in Fascist Italy, under Benito Mussolini.
0.12 Not a very pleasant place to be.
0.24 I asked my dad after -- obviously, when I found out about this.
0.20 And I said, "Didn't you resent America for not letting you be with your father in those formative and very threatening years?"
0.14 You know what he said to me?
0.16 "America was worth the wait.
0.48 "We're a country of laws, Bill.
0.25 We're a country of laws, not of men, not of people who do whatever they want to do.
0.16 I know we have a president who wants to do whatever he wants to do, and take his pen and his phone and just tell everybody what he thinks is best.
0.28 But the reason America is a great country, the reason is because our compassion is in our laws.
0.34 And when we live by those laws and we treat everybody equally under the law, that's when people feel good about being Americans.
0.22 We're going to be tough at the border, we're going to be tough on all of the illegal immigrants that everybody else in this field -- we're going to be different.
0.14 We're going to be actually out there trying to create a better life for hard-working Americans.
0.08 I think it's -- yeah, I think it's a one-two punch.
0.27 Number one, we have to create better paying jobs.
0.28 I mean, that's just the bottom line.
0.25 We haven't.
0.40 And that's the reason that I've said under my presidency, we'll create jobs and make American the number one manufacturing country in the world.
0.49 If we want to create jobs for the folks that you're talking about, who are having trouble getting off government benefits, primarily because of their low skill level, there is no better way -- it's worked for 100 years in America -- putting people back to work in manufacturing is it.
0.26 I'm going to be introducing a plan which I call the 2020 Perfect Vision for America.
0.53 It's a 20 percent flat rate tax, it'll take a blowtorch to the -- to the IRS.
0.24 It will create a manufacturing juggernaut in this country.
0.29 And you combine that with reforms of our welfare system.
0.53 You're looking at the -- at the man who introduced and fought on the floor as a freshman senator and passed the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 over two President Clinton vetoes.
0.43 Got 70 votes in the United States Senate.
0.22 Bipartisan issue.
0.23 And I ended a federal entitlement.
0.49 Never been done before, never been done since.
0.33 What we need to do is take the rest of the federal entitlements, not just welfare, but food stamps and Medicaid and housing programs and do the same thing we did with welfare.
0.12 Work requirements and time limits.
0.14 That will change everything.
0.22 We're going to suspend -- I've -- I've said this for four years.
0.37 We're going to suspend and repeal every executive order, every regulation that cost American jobs and is -- is -- is impacting our freedom.
0.43 And second, the First Amendment Defense Act, which is protecting religious liberty, if it's not passed by then, which I suspect it won't, because the president will veto it, I will institute an executive order to make sure that people of faith are not being -- not being harassed and persecuted by the federal government for standing up for the religious beliefs.
0.31 I came to Washington, D.C. in 1990.
0.17 That sounds like a long time ago.
0.20 It was.
0.34 It was 25 years ago, and I came by defeating the Democratic incumbent.
0.27 I came as a reformer.
0.58 I started the Gang of Seven, and it led to the overtaking of the 40-year Democratic rule of Congress, because I didn't -- I stood up to the old-boy network in Washington, D.C. because I believed that Washington was not the solution, that Washington was the problem, just like Ronald Reagan said.
0.20 I was a child of Ronald Reagan.
0.49 And I went there, and for 16 years, I fought the insiders and was able to get things done.
0.26 That's the difference.
0.25 We need to elect someone who will stand with the American people, who understands its greatness, who understands what an open economy and freedom is all about, but at the same time, has a record of being able to get things done in Washington like we've never seen before.
0.17 Reforms, everything from moral and cultural issues to economic issues.
0.19 Those of you health savings accounts.
0.31 Health savings accounts are something that we introduced.
0.29 It's a private-sector solution that believes in freedom, not Obamacare that believes in government control.
0.42 Those are the things we brought, and we were able to get things done.
0.09 If you want someone who's not going to divide Washington, but gets things done, then you should make me your president.
0.09 I'll tell you how optimistic I am about America.
0.16 Karen and I have seven children.
0.15 You don't have seven children and bring them into this world if you're not optimistic about the future of this country.
0.22 I am, but people are upset, and they're upset for a reason about the future of this country.
0.28 Donald Trump actually seized on it when he talked about immigration.
0.27 And I think the reason he did is because immigration is sort of an example of what's broken and what's wrong in Washington, D..C.You see, you have one side, the Democrats, and with immigration, all they care about is votes.
0.23 They don't care about American workers, they just care about bringing as many people in so they can get as many votes as they can.
0.16 ON the other side, you have so many Republicans, and what do they care about?
0.24 Helping business make profits.
0.20 There's nobody out there looking out for the American worker.
0.17 I'm looking out for the American worker.
0.38 I'm the only one on this stage who has a plan that's actually reduced -- actually going to reduce immigration.
0.15 Actually going to do something to help the American worker.
0.22 And you combine that with a plan to make manufacturing -- this country number one in manufacturing, you've got someone who's going to help revitalize and give hope to America, the place -- the place is that is the most hopeless today.
0.22 That's why I ask for your support for president.
0.20 Well, first of all, thank you all for having us.
0.26 You know, I won two record elections.
0.45 Last time I was elected governor, won a record margin in my state.
0.25 Martha, we got a lot of politicians that will kiss babies, cut ribbons, do whatever it takes to be popular.
0.25 That's not why I ran for office.
0.27 I ran for office to make the generational changes in Louisiana.
0.58 We've cut 26 percent of our budget.
0.60 We have 30,000 fewer state bureaucrats than the day I took office.
0.15 I don't think anybody has cut that much government anywhere, at any time.
0.50 As a result, eight credit upgrades; as a result, a top ten state for private sector job creation.
0.26 And we fought for statewide school choice, where the dollars follow the child, instead of the child following the dollars.
0.38 We've been the most pro-life state six years in a row.
0.26 My point is this: I won two landslide elections, I made big changes.
0.17 I think our country is tired of the politicians who simply read the polls and fail to lead.
0.69 Both Democrats and Republicans have gotten us in the mess we're in -- $18 trillion of debt, a bad deal with Iran, we're not staying with Israel.
0.10 I think the American people are look for real leadership.
0.20 That's what I've done in Louisiana, that's what I'll do in America.
0.25 Well, to start with, unlike President Obama, I'll actually name the enemy that we confront.
0.17 We've got a president who cannot bring himself to say the words "radical Islamic terrorism.
0.27 "Now, Bill, he loves to criticize America, apologize for us, criticize medieval Christians.
0.21 How can we beat an enemy if our commander-in-chief doesn't have the moral honesty and clarity to say that Islam has a problem, and that problem is radical Islam, to say they've got to condemn not generic acts of violence, but the individual murderers who are committing these acts of violence.
0.24 We've got a president who instead says, we're going to change hearts and minds.
0.09 Well, you know what?
0.22 Sometimes you win a war by killing murderous, evil terrorists.
0.24 We're going to take the political handcuffs off the military.
0.28 We will arm and train the Kurds.
0.18 We will work with our Sunni allies.
0.16 They know we will be committed to victory.
0.35 We had this failed red line with Assad and it discouraged folks that want to help us on the ground.
0.23 Finally, we'll take off the political handcuffs.
0.24 We'll go to the Congress.
0.30 This president has gone to Congress and said give me a three-year deadline, give me a ban on ground troops.
0.09 I'm going to go to the commanders and say give me a plan to win.
0.15 You can't send your troops into harm's way unless you give them every opportunity to be successful.
0.12 Well, this goes to the question you were just asking.
0.30 Look, under President Obama and Secretary Clinton, they're working hard to change the American dream into the European nightmare.
0.19 They do celebrate more dependence on the government.
0.17 Give Bernie Sanders credit.
0.23 At least he's honest enough to call himself a socialist.
0.31 Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, they're no better.
0.46 If we were to expand Medicaid, for every uninsured person we would cover, we'd kick more than one person out of private insurance or remove their opportunity to get private insurance.
0.31 We're going to have too many people in the cart rather than pulling the cart.
0.39 This isn't free money.
0.17 I know some people like to say, "well, this is free money."
0.33 We pay federal taxes.
0.36 We are borrowing money from China today.
0.30 The president of the United States admitting that he's weakening our government's position, our foreign policy standing, because he can't control spending in D.C..I don't -- look, I don't think anybody should be expanding Medicaid.
0.19 I think it's a mistake to create new and more expensive entitlement programs when we can't afford the ones we've got today.
0.16 We've got to stop this culture of government dependence.
0.19 I'll say this.
0.16 I don't think anybody should expand Medicaid.
0.25 I think it was a mistake to expand Medicaid everywhere in Ohio and across the country.
0.18 Well, a couple of things.
0.50 Planned Parenthood had better hope that Hillary Clinton wins this election, because I guarantee under President Jindal, January 2017, the Department of Justice and the IRS and everybody else that we can send from the federal government will be going in to Planned Parenthood.
0.20 This is absolutely disgusting, and revolts the conscience of the nation.
0.21 Absolutely, we need to defund Planned Parenthood.
0.47 In my own state, for example, we launched an investigation, asked the FBI to cooperate.
0.37 We just, earlier this week, kicked them out of Medicaid in Louisiana as well, canceled their provider contract.
0.28 They don't provide any abortions in Louisiana.
0.33 But in terms of shutting down the government, I don't think President Obama should choose to shut down the government simply to send taxpayer dollars to this group that has been caught, I believe, breaking the law, but also offending our values and our ethics.
0.19 It is time for Republicans in D.C. to fight.
0.27 Too often, they give up, they negotiate with themselves.
0.24 They said they would get rid of the unconstitutional amnesty.
0.28 They didn't do that.
0.26 They said they would repeal Obamacare if we gave them the majority.
0.26 They didn't do that either.
0.27 They said they'd shrink and balance the budget.
0.26 They haven't done that.
0.23 Absolutely, they should fight to fund -- defund Planned Parenthood, and I don't think the president should shut down the government simply to send our taxpayer dollars to this group.
0.23 To repeal these unconstitutional illegal orders, whether it's amnesty or whether it's this president going around the Congress, whether it's in Obamacare, to restore the rule of law.
0.38 I'd also go after these sanctuary cities, do everything we can to make sure that we are not -- that we are actually prosecuting and cutting off funding for cities that are harboring illegal aliens, and then finally making sure the IRS is not going after conservative or religious groups.
0.29 I would sign an executive order protecting religious liberty, our first amendment rights, so Christian business owners and individuals don't face discrimination for having a traditional view of marriage.
0.29 You know, we've got a lot of great talkers running for president.
0.12 We've already got a great talker in the White House.
0.25 We cannot afford four more years of on the job training.
0.13 We need a doer, not a talker.
0.20 We also need a nominee, a candidate who will endorse our own principles.
0.33 Jeb Bush says we've got to be willing to lose the primary in order to win the general.
0.14 Let me translate that for you.
0.17 That's the establishment telling us to hide our conservative principles to get the left and the media to like us.
0.35 That never works.
0.11 If we do that again, we will lose again, we will deserve to lose again.
0.24 One principle, for example, we've got to embrace is on immigration.
0.23 We must insist on assimilation -- immigration without assimilation is an invasion.
0.12 We need to tell folks who want to come here, they need to come here legally.
0.13 They need to learn English, adopt our values, roll up their sleeves and get to work.
0.31 I'm tired of the hyphenated Americans and the division.
0.16 I've got the backbone, I've got the band width, I've got the experience to get us through this.
0.17 I'm asking folks not just to join my campaign, but join a cause.
0.07 It is time to believe in America again.
0.16 MACCALLUM: Thank you, Governor.
0.17 You can trust me to do the following: that when I get on change with Hillary Clinton, we won't be debating about the science, we'll be debating about the solutions.
0.25 In her world, cap- and-trade would dominate, that we will destroy the economy in the name of helping the environment.
0.12 In my world, we'll focus on energy independence and a clean environment.
0.26 A healthy environment, a strong economy and energy independent America -- that would be the purpose of my presidency, is break the strangle hold that people enjoy on fossil fuels who hate our guts.
0.16 If we don't stop them over there, they are coming here just as sure as I stand here in front of you.
0.06 One thing I want to be clear about tonight.
0.31 If you're running for president of the United States and you don't understand that we need more American ground forces in Iraq and that America has to be part of a regional ground force that will go into Syria and destroy ISIL in Syria, then you're not ready to be commander in chief.
0.27 And you're not serious about destroying ISIL.According to the generals that I know and trust, this air campaign will not destroy ISIL.
0.18 We need a ground force in Iraq and Syria, and America has to be part of that ground force.
0.30 According to the FBI and the director of national intelligence, Syria's becoming a perfect platform to strike our nation.
0.26 I've got a very simple strategy as your president against ISIL.
0.17 Whatever it takes, as long as it takes, to defeat them.
0.32 I don't think it's a war on women for all of us as Americans to stand up and stop harvesting organs from little babies.
0.41 Let's take the money that we would give to Planned Parenthood and put it in women's health care without having to harvest the organs of the unborn.
0.28 The only way we're going to defund Planned Parenthood is have a pro-life president.
0.26 You want to see a war on women?
0.24 Come with me to Iraq and Afghanistan, folks.
0.42 I've been there 35 times.
0.19 I will show you what they do to women.
0.17 These mythical Arab armies that my friends talk about that are going to protect us don't exist.
0.23 If I am president of the United States, we're going to send soldiers back to Iraq, back to Syria, to keep us from being attacked here and keep soldiers in Afghanistan because we must.
0.11 I cannot tell you how much our nation is threatened and how we need a commander in chief who understands the threats to this nation.
0.34 If you're running for president of the United States and you do not understand that we cannot defend this nation without more of our soldiers over there, you are not ready for this job.
0.40 Change the Mexico City policy, not take one dime of taxpayer money to fund abortion organizations overseas, and restore the NSA that's been gutted.
0.25 We're going dark when it comes to detecting the next attack.
0.34 We have gutted our ability to detect the next attack.
0.17 And I would not stand for that as president of the United States.
0.24 I would take the fight to these guys, whatever it took, as long as it took.
0.14 First thing I'd tell the American people, whatever it takes to defend our nation, I would do.
0.34 To the 1 percent who have been fighting this war for over a decade, I'd try my best to be a commander-in-chief worthy of your sacrifice.
0.24 We're going to lose Social Security and Medicare if Republicans and Democrats do not come together and find a solution like Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill.
0.16 I will be the Ronald Reagan if I can find a Tip O'Neill.
0.28 When I was 21, my mom died.
0.28 When I was 22, my dad died.
0.31 We owned a liquor store, restaurant, bar and we lived in the back.
0.42 Every penny we needed from -- every penny we got from Social Security, because my sister was a minor, we needed.
0.33 Today, I'm 60, I'm not married, I don't have any kids.
0.23 I would give up some Social Security to save a system that Americans are going to depend on now and in the future.
0.46 Half of American seniors would be in poverty without a Social Security check.
0.17 If you make your president, I'm going to put the country ahead of the party.
0.10 I'm going to do what it takes to defend this nation.
0.16 This nation has been great to me, and that's the only way I know to pay you back.
0.11 Not the change we need at a time we need it.
0.32 We need somebody ready to be commander-in-chief on day one, who understands there are no moderates in Iran, they've been killed a long time ago.
0.19 That the Ayatollah is a radical jihadist who really means it when he chants, "Death to America, death to Israel."
0.26 And this deal is giving him a pathway to a bomb, a missile to deliver it, and money to pay for it all.
0.13 We need a president who can solve our problems, bring us together.
0.20 We're becoming Greece if we don't work together.
0.36 At the end of the day, ladies and gentlemen, our best days are ahead of us only if we work together, and I intend to put this country on a path of success by working together and doing the hard things that should have been done a very long time ago.
0.16 I think he means somebody who hasn't been a career politician, and who's been out of office for awhile.
0.15 I think the last eight years in the private sector have allowed me to see government from the outside, and I think that is a positive thing.
0.39 Yes, I thought about running four years ago.
0.26 I was ready to lead, but I wasn't ready to run.
0.13 But I look at this country today, and I look at how divided we are, I look at how politicians are always posturing and issuing sound bites but never solving problems.
0.35 What I did in New York was bring people together, an overwhelmingly Democratic state.
0.37 But I was able to get Democrats to support the most conservative sweeping policy changes in any state in America.
0.13 And when I look at Washington today, we need to bring us together.
0.22 We need to solve problems, we need to rebuild our military so we can stand up to radical Islam, we need to get our economy growing much faster by throwing out the corrupt tax code and lowering the rates.
0.29 We have to end crony capitalism in Washington, where the lobbyists and the powerful can get tax breaks and tax credits, and the American people don't get laws in their interest.
0.14 I can do that.
0.27 And I can do it regardless of what the makeup of Congress is because I did it in New York state.
0.14 So we need new leadership -- yes.
0.14 I will be that new leader.
0.28 Martha, religious liberty doesn't include encouraging a fellow American to engage in violent jihad and kill an American here.
0.27 That is not protected free speech.
0.18 That is not protected religious belief.
0.19 That is like shouting "fire" in a crowded theater, and that is illegal, and I would do everything in our power not just to go after those who are here who we know who are here, before they can radicalize other Americans to carry out attacks, and it's not just the ones they've arrested.
0.16 Think back to Garland, Texas.
0.27 But for that Texas police officer, we could have had a mass murder.
0.23 We have to shut down their internet capability.
0.23 We have to shut down, whether or not they're in prisons preaching or on -- in mosques preaching.
0.38 No radical Islam that is allowed to engage in encouraging violence against Americans, that is not protected speech.
0.17 Let me just add one thing about ISIS over there.
0.31 We have got to destroy their training camps and recruiting centers.
0.30 I was governor of New York on September 11.
0.34 I know that we are at greater risk today than at any time since then of another attack.
0.23 We have got to destroy their training camps over there before they can attack us here.
0.19 I don't agree that we're going to occupy and spend another decade or a trillion dollars.
0.18 What we need to do is destroy their ability to attack us here over there, and then get out.
0.23 You know, I have two sons.
0.19 Both served.
0.31 One as a marine officer in Iraq, one as an army officer in Afghanistan.
0.25 I do not see -- want to see one parent or loved one worrying about getting a call in the middle of the night.
0.16 I would not place one American life at risk unless it was absolutely necessary.
0.20 But to destroy ISIS, it is necessary.
0.11 I think he is right.
0.22 I don't think you expand entitlements when so many people are dependent on government and when the money the federal government is offering is going to be taken away from you after just a couple of years.
0.24 I changed that.
0.20 We put in place mandatory work fair (ph).
0.19 But we allowed people to keep health care.
0.23 We put in place child care support.
0.20 No, it should be repealed.
0.63 And by the way, when I left, there were over 1 million fewer people on welfare in New York state than when I took office... ... replacing dependency with opportunity.
0.22 My heart has not changed, because I've always been appalled by abortion.
0.13 I'm a Catholic, I believe life begins at conception.
0.29 But as Bill said earlier, Roe v. Wade, it's has been the law for 42 years, and I don't think we should continue to try to change it.
0.42 But we can do is defund Planned Parenthood, and by the way, put in place an absolute permanent ban on any taxpayer dollars ever being used to fund abortions.
0.17 Also, when you look at these videos, they are horrific and show just a hideous disrespect for life.
0.16 What else we can do is that we should believe in science.
0.18 You know, Hillary Clinton's always saying how Republicans don't follow science?
0.44 Well, they're the ones not listening to the scientists today, because doctors say that at 20 weeks that is a viable life inside the womb.
0.17 And at that point, it's a life that we have the right to protect, and I think we should protect.
0.38 So, I would pass legislation outlawing abortion after 20 weeks.
0.27 It is Hillary, it is Biden, it is the others who insist on allowing abortion well into viable (inaudible) wrong, and that should be stopped.
0.37 Bill, I defeated Mario Cuomo.
0.57 In the first day in office, my first executive order, I revoked every one of the executive orders that he had -- he had enacted over the prior 12 years.
0.21 I would do that to Barack Obama's executive orders.
0.35 But I'd sign a second one, as I did in New York, as well, having a hard hiring freeze on adding new employees except for the military or defense-related positions.
0.21 I'd sign that executive order.
0.59 When I left the workforce, New York State had been reduced by over 15 percent.
0.17 We can do that in Washington.
0.15 I will do that in Washington.
0.22 Divisive and with no vision.
0.20 No vision at all.
0.23 HEMMER: Wow.
0.23 Carly Fiorina.
0.19 My background is different.
0.09 I look at Washington, and I hear the talk, and I see the promises and it seems nothing ever changes.
0.21 Washington gets bigger, taxes get higher, and the American people feel more distance from our government.
0.37 I have the opportunity not just to run, but to win in the deep blue state of New York three times.
0.76 And not only did I win, but I then worked with a Democratic legislature to put in place the most sweeping conservative reforms of any state in America, taking us from the most dangerous state in America to the fourth safest; reducing our welfare rolls by over 1 million, and replacing over 700,000 private sector jobs.
0.18 I can govern by bringing people together.
0.23 And also, I've been tested in a way no one else has.
0.27 I was governor on September 11th, and I'm proud of my leadership in bringing New York through that time.
0.38 And when I left, we were stronger, we were safer, and we were more united than at any time in my lifetime.
0.14 We need to bring people together in Washington.
0.12 The talk has got to stop, the action has got to begin.
0.20 People can promise you something, I delivered in the blue state of New York.
0.23 I will deliver for the American people if I have the privilege of leading this country.
0.19 I think the times are different now.
0.17 I think the times are much more serious.
0.30 Because Obama and Clinton policies, the United States is moving further and further into a decline.
0.13 I want to reverse that decline.
0.09 That's why I've entered this race, and I think I have the experience to do it.
0.32 Former elected prosecutor, attorney general, governor, I was elected to all of those offices.
0.32 A person who, in fact, has a long experience in foreign-policy issues, which is different from many of the other governors and prospective governors who are running.
0.37 I was an Army intelligence agent and a veteran during the Cold War, assigned to West Germany.
0.36 I was the chairman of the National Commission on Homeland Security and Terrorism for the United States for five years.
0.21 I was a person who has dealt extensively with these homeland security issues.
0.28 I was a governor during the 9/11 attack.
0.46 I understand both of these issues, how to build the economy and doing that as a governor who'd built jobs, had cut taxes and also a governor who understands foreign-policy, and that's why I entered this race.
0.26 Well, yes, indeed.
0.32 I chaired the National Commission on Homeland Security Committee for United States.
0.40 We warned about the 9/11 attack before the 9/11 attack occurred.
0.32 I was the governor during the 9/11 attack when the Pentagon was struck.
0.24 And I'm going to tell you this, we need to use the benefit of our law enforcement people across this country, combined with our intelligence people across this country.
0.27 We need to use our technological advantages, because what we've warned of is an international guerrilla movement that threatens this country.
0.17 It's going to happen in this country, there are going to be further attacks.
0.26 We have to be prepared to defend the American people, prepare them for a long war, stand up for the defense of this country, and stand up for the values of this country...
0.10 I'll tell them that we're going to grow the economy so that we can give people better opportunities so they don't have to rely exclusively on benefit types of programs.
0.19 Some do, but many Americans are dying to have an opportunity to grow and to create something inside this economy.
0.11 And I'm glad that I have a chance to answer this question.
0.30 I've had the growth code (ph) there for about five years, and it's this specific program.
0.47 We're going to do a tax cut for all Americans.
0.62 We're going to have a three-bracket tax code, 10, 15 and 25 percent.
0.46 We're going to combine all commercial activity in business into one place in the tax code and charge it 15 percent, which is going to suddenly make us competitive with the rest of the world.
0.21 And we're going to eliminate the death tax.
0.14 With a couple of additional tweaks, we know what this will do.
0.18 It will cause the economy to grow, to explode, to create more jobs.
0.40 And first of all, we've got to recognize that there is problem that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have caused.
0.20 And that problem is too big regulations like the EPA, too much new taxes on business that we have seen and "Obamacare."
0.32 These are drags on the economy, it's a deliberate drag.
0.16 I propose to reverse that and get this economy moving again.
0.32 Well, as you know, I'm a former elected prosecutor, a former elected attorney general, trained at the University of Virginia in constitutional law, and I don't believe in litmus tests except this.
0.25 I believe we should be appointing Supreme Court justices who will follow the law and not try to make the law.
0.35 Now, the challenge we're seeing today is that the Supreme Court is being converted into some type of political body.
0.34 They have to have some legal basis and precedence for being able to follow the law instead of making the law up, and my goal is -- in appointing Supreme Court justices, would be to point -- to appoint justices who would follow the law.
0.17 Bill, I want to say one more thing about... Not -- not on that, no.
0.15 But let me say one more thing.
0.10 I want to -- before my time runs out I want to get back to this issue of ISIS versus Iran.
0.26 It is Iran that's the expansionist power.
0.34 ISIL is trying to create themselves into a new state.
0.17 Our job has to be to recognize the conflict between the two.
0.22 I have proposed there be a Middle East NATO so that we can combine our allies there to stand up to Iranian expansion, and at the same time join together to begin to stop and this ISIL thing before it becomes an actual state.
0.21 Well, it's not a matter of what the first executive order would be, Bill.
0.49 The matter is what orders exist now that shouldn't exist?The president has done an executive order with respect to illegal immigration that is illegal.
0.41 Illegal.
0.41 And it creates a -- a contempt for the law, for the rule of law.
0.21 If i were the president of the United States, I would go and look at every executive order that exists right now and determine which ones want to be voided, because the president shouldn't be legislating: not through that vehicle or any other.
0.27 We should be relying upon the leadership of the Congress to pass the laws.
0.21 Professional politician that can't be trusted.
0.30 Well, I was a conservative governor of Virginia, I governed that way, and that's my track record.
0.17 But the key thing that we're seeing now is serious challenges to this country that must change, the direction of this nation must change.
0.34 And that's why I've offered a specific program to the people of America tonight to address the fundamental problem of getting our country growing again, getting our economy growing, wages up, opportunities for people.
0.41 And second, the international crisis we are facing is most dreadful and most dangerous.
0.40 I have the experience as a prosecutor, attorney general, governor, United States Army intelligence veteran, governor during the 9/11 attack, chairman of the Terrorism Commission for this country.
0.14 It's time for real substance and real experience.
0.19 And that's what I'll offer to the people of the United States in this candidacy for the presidency.
0.18 Good evening, everyone.
0.22 I'm an eye surgeon from Bowling Green, Kentucky.
0.34 My wife, Kelly, and I have been married for nearly 25 years, and I spend my days defending the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
0.27 I think there's nothing more important than understanding that the Constitution restrains government, not the people.
0.10 I kind of have to laugh when I think of, "Mmm, sounds like a non sequitur."
0.18 He was asked whether or not he would be capable and it would be in good hands to be in charge of the nuclear weapons, and all of a sudden, there's a sideways attack at me.
0.16 I think that really goes to really the judgment.
0.18 Do we want someone with that kind of character, that kind of careless language to be negotiating with Putin?
0.21 Do we want someone like that to be negotiating with Iran?I think really there's a sophomoric quality that is entertaining about Mr. Trump, but I am worried.
0.23 I'm very concerned about him -- having him in charge of the nuclear weapons, because I think his response, his -- his visceral response to attack people on their appearance -- short, tall, fat, ugly -- my goodness, that happened in junior high.
0.20 Are we not way above that?
0.32 Would we not all be worried to have someone like that in charge of the nuclear arsenal?I think this goes back to essentially what we've been saying for the last two or three questions.
0.25 Carly Fiorina also said we're not going to talk with Putin.
0.23 Well, think if Reagan had said that during the Cold War?
0.23 We continued to talk with the Russians throughout the Cold War which is much more significant that where we are now.
0.22 Should we continue to talk with Iran?
0.40 Yes.
0.50 Should we cut up the agreement immediately?
0.23 That's absurd.
0.13 Wouldn't you want to know if they complied?
0.35 Now, I'm going to vote against the agreement because I don't think there's significant leverage, but it doesn't mean that I would immediately not look at the agreement, and cut it up without looking to see if whether or not Iran has complied.
0.27 The same goes with China.
0.04 I don't think we need to be rash, I don't think we need to be reckless, and I think need to leave lines of communication open.
0.11 Often we talk about whether we should be engaged in the world, or disengaged in the world, and I think this is an example of some who want to isolate us, actually, and not be engaged.
0.20 We do need to be engaged with Russia.
0.21 It doesn't mean we give them a free pass, or China a free pass, but, to be engaged, to continue to talk.
0.15 We did throughout the Cold War, and it would be a big mistake not to do it here.
0.16 Well, I hate to say it, but Donald Trump has a bit of a point here.
0.58 The case that was decided around 1900 was, people had a green card, were here legally, and they said that their children were citizens.
0.33 There's never been a direct Supreme Court case on people who were here illegally, whether or not their kids are citizens.
0.24 So it hasn't really been completely adjudicated.
0.32 The 14th Amendment says that "those who are here and under the jurisdiction."
0.38 The original author of the -- of the 14th Amendment said on the Senate floor that this was applying to slaves, and did not specifically apply to others.
0.23 Well, I'm glad we're having a discussion about taxes because everybody laments that we lose jobs overseas, we have.
0.68 Our companies, and our jobs are being chased overseas by a 70,000 page tax code, so, that's why I've chosen to get rid of the whole thing, and have one single rate, 14 and a-half percent for everybody, business, and for corporate income, and personal income.
0.25 But, we also get rid of the payroll tax, so the working class would get a tax break as well.
0.15 So, I think a flat tax, eliminating the tax code, getting rid of all the loopholes, is the way to go, and it's the way we get America going again.
0.27 Hugh, can I -- can I make a response to that?Can I make a response to that?May I make a response to that?He's referred to me... ... in his remarks.
0.48 May I make a response?The remark was made that there hadn't been anyone else on the podium opposed to the Iraq War.
0.25 I've made my career as being an opponent of the Iraq War.
0.42 I was opposed to the Syria war.
0.36 I was opposed to arming people who are our enemies.
0.37 Iran is now stronger because Hussein is gone.
0.28 Hussein was the great bulwark and counterbalance to the Iranians.
0.17 So when we complain about the Iranians, you need to remember that the Iraq War made it worse.
0.39 Originally, Governor Bush was asked, was the Iraq War a mistake, and he said, "No.
0.17 We'd do it again.
0.18 "We have to learn sometimes the interventions backfire.
0.42 The Iraq War backfired and did not help us.
0.30 We're still paying the repercussions of a bad decision.
0.31 We have make the decision now in Syria, should we topple Assad?
0.18 Many up here wanted to topple Assad, and it's like -- I said no, because if you do... ... ISIS will now be in charge of Syria...
0.24 If you want boots on the ground, and you want them to be our sons and daughters, you got 14 other choices.
0.12 There will always be a Bush or Clinton for you, if you want to go back to war in Iraq.
0.27 But the thing is, the first war was a mistake.
0.22 And I'm not sending our sons and our daughters back to Iraq.
0.30 The war didn't work.
0.10 We can amplify those who live there.
0.23 The Kurds deserve to be armed and I'll arm them.
0.26 We can use our Air Force to amplify the forces there.
0.09 But the boots on the ground need to be the people who live there.
0.22 Why are we always the world's patsies that we have to go over there and fight their wars for them?
0.17 They need to fight their wars, we need to defend American interests, but it is not in America's national security interests to have another war in Iraq.
0.10 I think one of the great problems, and what American people don't like about politics, is hypocrisy.
0.27 People have one standard for others and not for them -- for themselves.
0.54 There is at least one prominent example on the stage of someone who says they smoked pot in high school, and yet the people going to -- to jail for this are poor people, often African-Americans and often Hispanics, and yet the rich kids who use drugs aren't.
0.16 I personally think that this is a crime for which the only victim is the individual, and I think that America has to take a different attitude.
0.16 I would like to see more rehabilitation and less incarceration.
0.26 I'm a fan of the drug courts which try to direct you back towards work and less time in jail.
0.32 But the bottom line is the states.
0.24 We say we like the 10th Amendment, until we start talking about this.
0.32 And I think the federal government has gone too far, I think that the war on drugs has had a racial outcome, and really has been something that has really damaged our inner cities.
0.33 Not only do the drugs damage them, we damage them again by incarcerating them and then preventing them from getting employment over time.
0.13 So I don't think that the federal government should override the states.
0.26 I believe in the 10th Amendment and I really will say that the states are left to themselves.
0.08 Well, I think if we left it open, we could see how many people smoked pot in high school.
0.16 Well, you know, the thing is that... Yeah, I was talking about (inaudible) -- well, let me...
0.16 But let me respond.
0.39 The thing is, is that in Florida, Governor Bush campaigned against medical marijuana.
0.34 That means that a small child like Morgan Hintz (ph) that has seizures is day, is failing on non-traditional medications, is not allowed to use cannabis oil.
0.14 And if they do that in Florida, they will take the child away, they will put the parents in jail.
0.32 And that's what that means if you're against allowing people use medical marijuana, you'll actually put them in jail.
0.22 And actually, under the current circumstances, kids who had privilege like you do, don't go to jail, but the poor kids in our inner cities go to jail.
0.08 I don't think that's fair.
0.12 And I think we need to acknowledge it, and it is hypocritical to still want to put poor people in jail... BUSH: I don't want to put poor people in jail, Randy.
0.22 Well, you vote -- you oppose medical marijuana...
0.17 But that means you'll put people in jail.
0.25 Understand what they're saying.
0.42 if they're going to say we are going to enforce the federal law against what the state law is, they aren't really believing in the Tenth Amendment.
0.42 Governor Christie would go into Colorado, and if you're breaking any federal law on marijuana, even though the state law allows it, he would put you in jail.
0.24 If a young mother is trying to give her child cannabis oil for medical marijuana for seizure treatment, he would put her in jail, if it violates federal law.
0.17 I would let Colorado do what the Tenth Amendment says.
0.31 This power -- we were never intended to have crime dealing at the federal level.
0.24 Crime was supposed to be left to the states.
0.16 Colorado has made their decision.
0.18 And I don't want the federal government interfering and putting moms in jail, who are trying to get medicine for their kid... May I respond?
0.31 May I respond?Here is the thing, he doesn't want to make it about medical marijuana, but what if New Jersey's medical marijuana contradicts the federal law?
0.34 He's saying he'll send the federal government in, and he will enforce the federal law.
0.29 That's not consistent with the Tenth Amendment.
0.27 It is not consistent with states' rights.
0.26 And it is not consistent with the conservative vision for the country.
0.21 I don't think we should be sending the federal police in to arrest a mother and separate them from their child for giving a medicine to their child for seizures.
0.11 If you want a skeptic -- if you want a skeptic, Jake, I will happily jump into that briar patch.
0.50 If you want a real... A second opinion?One of the greatest -- one of the greatest medical discoveries of all times was -- were the vaccines, particularly for smallpox.
0.28 And if you want to read a story, it's called The Speckled Monster, it's an amazing story, it was all done voluntary.
0.30 But people came in by the droves.
0.22 George Washington wouldn't let his wife visit until she got vaccinated.
0.13 So I'm all for vaccines.
0.25 But I'm also for freedom.
0.15 Ooh, that's a tough one.
0.29 You know, I'm big on -- that we were -- and I love what Carly said about women's suffrage.
0.13 I think Susan B. Anthony might be a good choice.
0.35 I met Ronald Reagan as a teenager, and my family, we're big supporters of him when he ran against Gerald Ford.
0.41 It was a big deal because he was the grassroots, running against the establishment, and I'll never forget that.
0.16 And, how he stood up and said, you know what, this is something new that our country needs, and our party needs.
0.14 If I were president, I would try to be one who says, you know what, I'm a Reagan Conservative.
0.25 I'm someone who believes in peace through strength, and I would try to lead the country in that way knowing that our goal is peace, and that war is the last resort, not the first resort.
0.37 And, that when we go to war, we go to war in a constitutional way, which means that we have to vote on it, that war is initiated by congress, not by the president, that we go to war electively (ph).
0.33 That when we go to war, we don't fight with one arm tied behind our back, we fight all out to win, but then we come home.
0.22 I'm Mike Huckabee.
0.21 I'm delighted to be on this stage with some remarkable fellow Republicans.
0.17 I know that there are some in the Wall-Street-to-Washington axis of power who speak of all of us contemptuously.
0.13 But I'm here to say that I think we are, in fact, the A team.
0.32 We have some remarkable people, and, in fact, not only are we the A team; we even have our own Mr. T, who doesn't mind saying about others, "you're a fool.
0.25 "And I'm delighted to be here with all of these guys, and would put any of them in an administration that I led.
0.16 Thank you very much.
0.05 I would certainly love to get in on this, because I think the single...
0.22 I've been patiently waiting, and I'm going to just say this about Iran.
0.36 This threatens Israel immediately, this threatens the entire Middle East, but it threatens the United States of America.
0.14 And we can't treat a nuclear Iranian government as if it is just some government that would like to have power.
0.56 This is a government for 36 years has killed Americans, they kidnapped Americans, they have maimed Americans.
0.26 They have sponsored terrorist groups, Hamas and Hezbollah, and they threaten the very essence of Western civilization.
0.20 To give them this agreement, that the president treats like the Magna Carta, but Iranians treat it like it's toilet paper, and we must, simply, make it very clear that the next president, one of us on this stage, will absolutely not honor that agreement, and will destroy it and will be tough with Iran, because otherwise, we put every person in this world in a very dangerous place.
0.20 No, no.
0.14 Let me finish this one thought, Jake.
0.10 I haven't gotten that much time, so I'm going to take just what little I can here.
0.24 You're telling me that you cannot make an accommodation for an elected Democrat county clerk from Rowan County, Kentucky?
0.19 What else is it other than the criminalization of her faith and the exaltation of the faith of everyone else who might be a Fort Hood shooter or a detainee at Gitmo?I have a different idea.
0.09 I think we ought to get rid of all the taxes on people who produce.
0.20 Why should we penalize productivity?
0.23 And it's why I'm an unabashed supporter of the "fair tax," which would be a tax on our consumption, rather than a tax on our productivity.
0.13 In other words, you're not going to tax anybody for what they earn, whether it's worker whose working by the hour or whether it's a hedge fund manager.
0.17 If they can produce something and bring capital and labor to create jobs, we need some jobs.
0.20 And I think the "fair tax" makes more sense.
0.43 Now, Jake, I've been listening to everybody on the stage and there is a lot of back and forth about I'm the only one who has done this, the only one who has done that, I've done great things.
0.15 We've all done great things or we wouldn't be on this stage.
0.26 But it occurs to me as we're sitting here in the Reagan Library that most of us would like to pay tribute to a guy who, when he got elected, didn't get elected telling everybody how great he was.
0.22 He got elected telling everybody how great the American people were.
0.12 And he empowered them to live their dreams, which is what I'd love to see us do by no longer penalizing the people who are out there working because they are taking a gut punch right now....You don't want me operating on you, I assure you.
0.50 Just today -- just today, there was a new report that 50 different intelligence analysts have said that what they sent up the ladder was doctored by senior officials, so that they could give some happy talk to the situation that we face.
0.19 I love the idea of a good intellectual capacity to deal with our enemies, but the fact is, if you don't have good intelligence that is reliable and honest, you won't have good intelligence and you cannot make good decisions.
0.16 The next president is primarily elected not just to know things, but to know what to do with the things that he knows.
0.15 And the most dangerous person in any room is the person who doesn't know what he doesn't know.
0.20 And the reason Barack Obama has been dangerous to this country and we better elect someone who had some executive experience, is because we cannot afford another eight years having a person in the office who doesn't know what he does not know.
0.13 You better believe I will, because I'm tired of liberals always having a litmus test and conservatives are supposed to pretend we don't.
0.09 Well let me tell you what mine would be.
0.13 Number one, I'd ask do you think that the unborn child is a human being or is it just a blob of tissue?
0.09 I'd want to know the answer to that.
0.19 I'd want to know do you believe in the First Amendment, do you believe that religious liberty is the fundamental liberty around which all the other freedoms of this country are based?
0.18 And I'd want to know do you really believe in the Second Amendment, do you believe that we have an individual right to bear arms to protect ourselves and our family and to protect our country?
0.20 And do you believe in the Fifth and the 14th Amendment?
0.31 Do you believe that a person, before they're deprived of life and liberty, should in fact have due process and equal protection under the law?
0.30 Because if you do, you're going to do more than defund Planned Parenthood.
0.16 One final thing.
0.16 I'd make darn sure that we absolutely believe the 10th Amendment.
0.15 Every governor on this stage would share this much with you.
0.37 Every one of us -- our biggest fight wasn't always with the legislature or even with the Democrats.
0.49 My gosh, half the time, it was with the federal government who apparently never understood ---- that if it's not reserved in the Constitution, then the 10th Amendment says it's left to the states.
0.19 But somebody forgot to send a memo to Washington.
0.22 I think we need to remember that there are maybe some controversies about autism, but there is no controversy about the things that are really driving the medical costs in this country.
0.27 And I would really believe that the next president ought to declare a war on cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and Alzheimer's, because those are the four things that are causing the greatest level of cost.
0.29 John Kennedy said, "we'll go to the moon in a decade and bring a man back," and we did it.
0.21 I grew up in the '50s.
0.18 I remember the polio vaccine.
0.45 We saved billions of dollars since that time, because we haven't had to treat for polio.
0.29 Why doesn't this country focus on cures rather than treatment?
0.63 Why don't we put a definitive focus scientifically on finding the cure for cancer, for heart disease, for diabetes and for Alzheimer's, a disease alone that will cost us --$1.1 trillion by the year 2050.
0.32 We change the economy and the country.
0.19 That's an easy one.
0.13 I'd put my wife on there.
0.26 I've been married to her 41 years.
0.19 She's fought cancer and lived through it.
0.49 She's raised three kids, five great grandkids, and she's put up with me.
0.19 I mean, who else could possibly be on that money other than my wife.
0.10 And that way, she could spend her own money with her face.
0.11 At the end of my presidency I would like to believe that the world would be a safe place, and there wouldn't be the threats.
0.34 not only to the U.S., but to Israel and our allies, because we would have the most incredible well-trained, well-equipped, well- prepared military in the history of mankind.
0.16 And they would know that the commander-in-chief would never send them to a mission without all the resources necessary, but people wouldn't bully us anymore.
0.10 Because they would know that that would be an invitation to their destruction.
0.31 Domestically, we would be operating under a tax system that eliminated the IRS.
0.21 People wouldn't be punished for their work, and for what they produced.
0.15 And life would be really deemed precious.
0.15 Abortion would be no more.
0.23 It would be as much of a scourge in our past as slavery is.
0.22 And we would have a peaceful country, where people respected each other and people respected law enforcement.
0.17 And we would focus on cures.
0.32 And we would make this country not only safe from our enemies without, but safe from the enemies within.
0.12 And it would be a good place to raise our kids and our grandkids.
0.14 Thank you.
0.19 My name is Marco Rubio.
0.18 I'm from Florida.
0.45 My wife Jeanette and I are the proud -- we've been married 17 years, and we're the proud parents of four children, two of whom were able to join us here this evening.
0.19 I'm honored to be here at the Reagan Library, at a place that honors the legacy of a man who inspired not just my interest in public service, but also our love for country.
0.20 And I'm also aware that California has a drought, and so that's why I made sure I brought my own water.
0.32 Well, first of all, I have an understanding of exactly what it is Russia and Putin are doing, and it's pretty straightforward.
0.23 He wants to reposition Russia, once again, as a geopolitical force.
0.36 He himself said that the destruction of the Soviet Union -- the fall of the Soviet Union was the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century, and now he's trying to reverse that.
0.32 He's trying to destroy NATO.
0.15 And this is what this is a part of.
0.40 He is exploiting a vacuum that this administration has left in the Middle East.
0.17 Here's what you're gonna see in the next few weeks: the Russians will begin to fly -- fly combat missions in that region, not just targeting ISIS, but in order to prop up Assad.
0.28 He will also, then, turn to other countries in the region and say, "America is no longer a reliable ally, Egypt.
0.26 America is no longer a reliable ally, Saudi Arabia.
0.21 Begin to rely on us.
0.39 "What he is doing is he is trying to replace us as the single most important power broker in the Middle East, and this president is allowing it.
0.25 That is what is happening in the Middle East.
0.14 That's what's happening with Russia, and... Let me tell you -- I will tell you we have zero responsibility, because let's remember what the president said.
0.19 He said the attack he would conduct would be a pinprick.
0.27 Well, the United States military was not build to conduct pinprick attacks.
0.29 If the United States military is going to be engaged by a commander-in-chief, it should only be engaged in an endeavor to win.
0.15 And we're not going to authorize use of force if you're not put in a position where they can win.
0.15 And quite frankly, people don't trust this president as commander-in-chief because of that.
0.45 In the middle of negotiating this treaty, Khamenei led the assembled masses in chanting, death to America.
0.23 I'm reminded of a great editorial cartoon.
0.35 It shows the Ayatollah Khamenei saying, "Death to all Americans," and then it shows John Kerry coming back, saying, "Can we meet ya half way?
0.15 "We need a commander-in-chief who will stand up and protect this country.
0.17 And I'll tell you, I can't wait to stand on that debate stage with Hillary Clinton and to make abundantly clear if you vote for Hillary, you are voting for the Ayatollah Khomeini to possess a nuclear weapon and if you elect me as president, under no circumstances will a theocratic ayatollah who chants death to America ever be allowed to acquire a nuclear weapon.
0.17 Ms. Dana, I agree that English is the unifying language of our country, and everyone should learn to speak it.
0.22 It's important.
0.16 I want to tell you a story about someone that didn't speak English that well.
0.41 It was my grandfather; he came to this country in the 1960s, as a -- escaping Cuba.
0.30 And he lived with us, growing up.
0.22 And my grandfather loved America.
0.18 He understood what was so special about this country.
0.25 He loved Ronald Reagan; he would be very proud of the fact that we're here this evening.
0.34 My grandfather instilled in me the belief that I was blessed to live in the one society in all of human history where even I, the son of a bartender and a maid, could aspire to have anything, and be anything that I was willing to work hard to achieve.
0.33 But he taught me that in Spanish, because it was the language he was most comfortable in.
0.28 And he became a conservative, even though he got his news in Spanish.
0.14 And so, I do give interviews in Spanish, and here's why -- because I believe that free enterprise and limited government is the best way to help people who are trying to achieve upward mobility.
0.11 And if they get their news in Spanish, I want them to hear that directly from me.
0.18 Not from a translator at Univision.
0.14 Well, let me say that legal immigration is not an issue I read about in the newspaper.
0.26 Immigration, illegal immigration, all the good aspects of immigration and all the negative ones as well, I live with.
0.19 My family's immigrants.
0.25 My neighbors are all immigrants.
0.39 My in-laws are all immigrants.
0.29 So I've seen every aspect of it, and I can tell you America doesn't have one immigration problem, it has three.
0.70 And third, we have 11 million or 12 million people, many of whom have been here for longer than a decade who are already here illegally.
0.27 And we must deal with all three of these problems.
0.43 We cannot deal with all three of these problems in one massive piece of legislation.
0.18 I learned that.
0.24 We tried it that way.
0.13 After we've done that, step two would be to modernize our legal immigration system so you come to America on the basis of what you can contribute economically, not whether or not simply you have a relative living here.
0.17 And after we've done those two things, I believe the American people... ... will be very reasonable and responsible about what you do with someone who's been here and isn't a criminal.
0.15 If you're a criminal, obviously, you will not be able to stay.
0.34 Yes, well, it does.
0.11 But it's in the following way, this is an important question.
0.15 I think if you're running for president, these are important issues, because look at around the world today.
0.28 There is a lunatic in North Korea with dozens of nuclear weapons and long-range rocket that can already hit the very place in which we stand tonight.
0.36 The Chinese are rapidly expanding their military.
0.25 They hack into our computers.
0.32 They're building artificial islands in the South China Sea, the most important shipping lane in the world.
0.28 A gangster in Moscow is not just threatening Europe, he's threatening to destroy and divide NATO.
0.32 You have radical jihadists in dozens of countries across multiple continents.
0.33 And they even recruit Americans using social media to try to attack us here at home.
0.41 And now we have got this horrible deal with Iran where a radical Shia cleric with an apocalyptic vision of the future is also guaranteed to one day possess nuclear weapons and also a long-range rocket that can hit the United States.
0.22 These are extraordinarily dangerous times that we live in.
0.28 And the next president of the United States better be someone that understands these issues and has good judgment about them because the number one issue that a president will ever confront, and the most important obligation that the federal government has, is to keep this nation safe.
0.35 And today we are not doing that.
0.47 We are eviscerating our military.
0.37 And we have a president that is more respectful to the ayatollah in Iran than he is to the prime minister of Israel.
0.21 Well, that's why we have a debate.
0.11 I think that we should have a deeper debate about these issues, because there is no more important decision that a president will make.
0.27 Well, you should ask him questions in detail about the foreign policy issues our president will confront, because you had better be able to lead our country on the first day.
0.44 Not six months from now, not a year from now, on the first day in office, our president could very well confront a national security crisis.
0.16 You can't predict it.
0.17 Sometimes you cannot control it.
0.26 And it is the most -- the federal government does all kinds of things it's not supposed to be doing.
0.29 It regulates bathrooms.
0.32 It regulates schools that belong to local communities.
0.28 But the one thing that the federal government must do, the one thing that only the federal government can do is keep us safe.
0.18 And a president better be up-to-date on those issues on his first day in office, on her first day in office.
0.20 Trust (ph) me, I get that.
0.19 OK.I never get to addressed, and... ...and when I do, I'm gonna jump in.
0.19 Yeah.
0.30 He did.
0.11 Let me -- I'm proud to serve in the United States Senate.
0.39 You know, when I ran five years ago, the entire leadership of my party in Washington lined up against me.
0.13 But I'm glad I won.
0.19 And I'm glad that I ran, because this country's headed in the wrong direction.
0.12 And if we keep electing the same people, nothing is going to change.
0.21 And you're right, I have missed some votes, and I'll tell you why, Mr. Trump.
0.32 Because in my years in the Senate, I've figured out very quickly that the political establishment in Washington, D.C. in both political parties is completely out of touch with the lives of our people.
0.20 You have millions of people in this country living paycheck to paycheck, and nothing is being done about it.
0.49 We are about to leave our children with $18 trillion in -- in -- in debt, and they're about to raise the debt limit again.
0.38 We have a world that grows increasingly dangerous, and we are eviscerating our military spending and signing deals with Iran.
0.28 And these -- if this thing continues, we are going to be the first Americans to leave our children worse off than ourselves.
0.33 That's why I'm missing votes.
0.21 Because I am leaving the Senate, I'm not running for re-election, and I'm running for president because I know this: unless we have the right president, we cannot make America fulfill its potential, but with the right person in office, the 21st century can be the greatest era that our nation has ever known.
0.36 I want to go even deeper -- and I want to go even deeper in that direction, because I think the belief that somehow by retreating, America makes the world safer has been disproven every single time it's ever been tried.
0.23 Syria's a perfect example of it.
0.40 The uprising in Syria was not started by the United States; it was started by the Syrian people.
0.51 And I warned at the time -- this was three and a half years ago -- I openly and repeatedly warned that if we did not find moderate elements on the ground that we could equip and arm, that void would be filled by radical jihadists.
0.46 Well, the president didn't listen, the administration didn't follow through, and that's exactly what happened.
0.13 That is why ISIS grew.
0.42 That is why ISIS then came over the border from Syria and back into Iraq.
0.27 What is happening in that region is the direct consequence of the inability to lead and of disengagement.
0.18 And the more we disengage, the more airplanes from Moscow you're going to see flying out of Damascus and out of Syria... ... as you asked earlier today.
0.20 But radical terrorism cannot be solved by intellect.
0.11 It cannot -- they require -- what they need, is they need an operating space.
0.29 That's what Afghanistan was for Al Qaida.
0.34 It was a vacuum that they filled, and they created an operating space.
0.18 That's why they had to be drawn out of there.
0.22 That's why they had to be destroyed.
0.20 It is the reason why ISIS has grown as well.
0.32 We allowed them -- we allowed a vacuum to emerge in Syria.
0.28 They used it as an operating space to grow; and today they're not just in Iraq and Syria anymore, they're now in Libya, conducting operations in the Sinai.
0.24 They're now in Afghanistan, trying to supplant the Taliban as the most powerful radical jihadist group on the ground there, as well.
0.29 You cannot allow radical jihadists to have an operating safe haven anywhere in the world.
0.21 There's a broader issue here, Hugh.
0.18 And there's a broader issue here as well.
0.49 First of all, the only people that follow the law are law-abiding people.
0.33 Criminals by definition ignore the law, so you can pass all the gun laws in the world, like the left wants.
0.22 The criminals are going to ignore it because they are criminals.
0.20 The real issue -- the real issue is not what are people using to commit violence, but why are they committing the violence?
0.20 And here's the truth: Because you cannot separate the social, moral wellbeing of your people from their economic and other wellbeing.
0.23 You cannot separate it.
0.24 You can't have a strong country without strong people, you cannot have strong people without strong values, and you cannot have strong values without strong families and the institutions in this country that defend and support those families.
0.21 Well, and today, we have a left-wing government under this president that is undermining all of the institutions and society that support the family and teach those values.
0.31 Because we're not going to destroy our economy the way the left-wing government that we are under now wants to do.
0.24 We're not going to... Well, and I don't -- he may have lined up with their positions on this issue.
0.24 But here is the bottom line.
0.35 Every proposal they put forward are going to be proposals that will make it harder to do business in America, that will make it harder to create jobs in America.
0.30 Single parents are already struggling across this country to provide for their families.
0.16 Maybe a billionaire here in California can afford an increase in their utility rates, but a working family in Tampa, Florida, or anywhere across this country cannot afford it.
0.16 But America is not a planet.
0.44 And we are not even the largest carbon producer anymore, China is.
0.19 And they're drilling a hole and digging anywhere in the world that they can get a hold of.
0.18 So the bottom line is, I am not in favor of any policies that make America a harder place for people to live, or to work, or to raise their families.
0.18 Jake, you mentioned me and called me a denier.
0.16 Let me say, climate change... OK. A skeptic.
0.14 You can measure the climate.
0.12 You can measure it.
0.24 That's not the issue we're discussing.
0.11 Here is what I'm skeptical of.
0.16 I'm skeptical of the decisions that the left wants us to make, because I know the impact those are going to have and they're all going to be on our economy.
0.23 They will not do a thing to lower the rise of the sea.
0.13 They will not do a thing to cure the drought here in California.
0.16 But what they will do is they will make America a more expensive place to create jobs.
0.25 And today with millions of people watching this broadcast that are struggling paycheck to paycheck that do not know how they're going to pay their bills at the end of this month, I'm not in favor of anything that is going to make it harder for them to raise their family.
0.35 The -- Rosa Parks, an everyday American that changed the course of history.
0.20 Well, there are some people in Florida upset at me over a joke I made about Florida State, but, what the heck, I want my codename to be Gator.
0.51 One of the things that made Ronald Reagan a great president, is that he understood that America was a unique nation, like any other that had existed throughout human history.
0.43 He knew it was founded on universal principles that were powerful, the dignity of all people, human rights, the rights of all to live in freedom and liberty, and choose their own path in life.
0.24 He didn't just believe it, he acted on it.
0.20 That's why bringing down communism was so important to him.
0.38 If I'm honored with the opportunity to be president, I hope that our Air Force One will fly, first and foremost, to our allies; in Israel, in South Korea, and Japan.
0.24 They know we stand with them.
0.15 That America can be counted on.
0.21 It would also fly to China, not just to meet with our enemies, not just to meet with those adversaries of ours that are there, but also to meet with those that aspire to freedom and liberty within China.
0.16 I would even invite them to my inauguration.
0.23 We would also fly into Moscow and into Russia.
0.22 And not just meet with the leaders of Russia, but also meet with those who aspire to freedom and liberty in Russia.
0.22 And ultimately, I hope that my Air Force One, if I become president, will one day land in a free Cuba, where its people can choose its leaders and its own destiny.
0.24 I'm Ted Cruz.
0.19 I am the son of an Irish-Italian mom and a Cuban immigrant dad who fled oppression and came to America seeking freedom.
0.11 I'm a husband to my best friend, Heidi, who's here tonight.
0.24 I'm a dad to two little girls who are the loves of my life, Caroline and Catherine.
0.31 If you're fed up with Washington, if you're looking for someone to stand up to career politicians in both parties, I'm the only one on this stage who has done that over and over again, and if we stand together, we can bring America back.
0.25 Well, let me tell you, Jake, the single biggest national security threat facing America right now is the threat of a nuclear Iran.
0.51 We've seen six and a half years of President Obama leading from behind.
0.24 Weakness is provocative, and this Iranian nuclear deal is nothing short of catastrophic.
0.58 This deal, on its face, will send over $100 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, making the Obama administration the world's leading financier of radical Islamic terrorism.
0.41 This deal abandons four American hostages in Iran, and this deal will only accelerate Iran's acquiring nuclear weapons.
0.07 You'd better believe it.
0.27 If I am elected president, on the very first day in office, I will rip to shreds this catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal.
0.09 Well, let's be clear when it comes to experience.
0.39 What President Obama wants to do is he's run to the United Nations, and he wants to use the United Nations to bind the United States, and take away our sovereignty.
0.57 Well, I spent five and a half years as a Solicitor General of Texas, the lead lawyer for the state, in front of the U.S. Supreme Court, and I went in front of the Supreme Court, and took on the world court of the United Nations in a case called Medellin v. Texas, and we won a historic victory saying the World Court, and the U.N., has no power to bind the United States, and no President of the United States, Republican or Democrat, has the authority to give away our sovereignty.
0.26 And, so, if there's anyone up here who would be bound by this catastrophic deal with Iran, they're giving up the core responsibility of commander in chief, and as president, I would never do that.
0.29 Hold on, a second, Jake, he asked me, as well.
0.14 I'd like to actually... ... respond.
0.15 I think I'm the first senator.
0.22 The No.
0.33 1 test for use of military force should be the vital national security interest of the United States.
0.46 The reason why I opposed President Obama bombing Syria, is because he couldn't answer the question what do you do if chemical weapons end up in the hands of radical Islamic terrorists like al-Nusra, like Al Qaida, like ISIS?Now, I also want to respond to several folks up here who said we should trust this Iranian deal, see if the Iranians will comply.
0.19 Anyone who is paying attention to what Khamenei says knows that they will not comply.
0.31 There is a reason Khamenei refers to Israel as the little Satan, and America as the great Satan.
0.33 Jake, Jake... Jake, there is no more important topic in 2016 than this topic right here, and I've listened to several folks saying, "Well, gosh, if they cheat, we'll act.
0.33 "And most astonishingly, this agreement trusts the Iranians to inspect themselves.
0.24 That makes no sense whatsoever.
0.38 And let me know -- President Obama is violating federal law... ... by not handing over the side deals, and we ought to see the United States Congress... ... stand up together and say, "Hand over this treaty, and protect this country.
0.09 "Well, let me tell you, Dana, number one, I'm proud to stand for life.
0.32 These Planned Parenthood videos are horrifying.
0.19 I would encourage every American to watch the videos.
0.27 See -- seeing your Planned Parenthood officials callously, heartlessly bartering and selling the body parts of human beings, and then ask yourself, "are these my values?
0.64 "Absolutely we shouldn't be sending $500 million of taxpayer money to funding an ongoing criminal enterprise, and I'll tell you, the fact that Republican leadership in both houses has begun this discussion by preemptively surrendering to Barack Obama and saying, "we'll give in because Obama threatens a veto.
0.24 "You know, Obama's committed to his principles.
0.18 His liberal principles, he will fight for them.
0.32 He says...
0.33 I will veto any budget that doesn't fund Planned Parenthood, and Republicans surrender.
0.11 We need to stop surrendering and start standing... ...for our principles.
0.25 Well, Jake, you know, I'm -- I'm very glad that Donald Trump's being in this race has forced the mainstream media finally to talk about illegal immigration.
0.09 I think that's very important.
0.24 I like and respect Ben Carson.
0.18 I'll let him talk about his own plans.
0.26 But I will say this: The natural next question that primary voters are asking, after we focus on illegal immigration is, okay, what are the records of the various candidates?
0.19 And this is an issue on which there are stark differences.
0.53 In 2013, when Barack Obama and Harry Reid joined the Washington Republicans in a massive, I stood shoulder to shoulder with Jeff Sessions helping lead the fight.
0.12 You know, folks here have talked about, how do you secure the borders?
0.60 Well, I've been leading the fight in the Senate to triple the Border Patrol, to put in place fencings and walls, to put in place a strong biometric exit/entry system... Well, Dana, I've known John Roberts for 20 years, he's amazingly talented lawyer, but, yes, it was a mistake when he was appointed to the Supreme Court.
0.47 He's a good enough lawyer that he knows in these Obamacare cases he changed the statute, he changed the law in order to force that failed law on millions of Americans for a political outcome.
0.25 And, you know, we're frustrated as conservatives.
0.16 We keep winning elections, and then we don't get the outcome we want.
0.16 And, let me focus on two moments in time.
0.65 Number one, in 1990, in one room was David Souter, and in another room was Edith Jones, the rock ribbed (ph) conservative on the fifth circuit court of appeals.
0.42 George Herbert Walker Bush appointed David Souter.
0.63 And then in 2005, in one room was John Roberts, in another room was my former boss, Mike Luttig, the rock ribbed (ph) conservative on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals... ...George W. Bush appointed John Roberts, and let me give you the consequences of that.
0.64 If, instead, the President Bush had appointed Edith Jones, and Mike Luttig, which is who I would have appointed, Obamacare would have been struck down three years ago, and the marriage laws of all 50 states would be on the books.
0.15 These matter, and I fought to defend the constitution my whole life... ...and I will as president as well.
0.41 It is true that after George W. Bush nominated John Roberts, I supported his confirmation.
0.18 That was a mistake and I regret that.
0.19 I wouldn't have nominated John Roberts, and indeed, Governor Bush pointed out why.
0.34 It wasn't that the President Bushes wanted to appoint a liberal to the court, it's that it was the easier choice.
0.36 Both David Souter and John Roberts, they didn't have a long paper trail.
0.28 If you had nominated Edith Jones or Mike Ludig (ph) you would have had a bloody fight and they weren't willing to spend political capital to put a strong judicial conservative on the court.
0.45 I have spent my entire life, starting from clerking for Chief Justice William Rehnquist on the United States Supreme Court, one of the most principled jurists.
0.29 We have an out-of-control Court, and I give you my word, if I'm elected president, every single Supreme Court justice will faithfully follow the law and will not act like philosopher kings -- TAPPER: Thank you, Senator.-- imposing their liberal policies on millions of Americans ---- who need to be trusted to govern ourselves.
0.24 I -- I am not, and -- and you mentioned that the U.S. Supreme Court had rightly upheld the individual right to keep and bear arms.
0.47 I was proud to lead 31 states before the U.S. Supreme Court defending the Second Amendment, and we won that landmark victory.
0.29 And indeed, just a couple of years ago, when Harry Reid and Barack Obama came after the right to keep and bear arms of millions of Americans, I was proud to lead the fight in the United States Senate to protect our right to keep and bear arms, and for that reason... ...
0.37 I was honored to be endorsed by Gun Owners of America... ... as the strongest supporter of the Second Amendment on this stage today, and I will... ... fight every day to defend the Bill of Rights.
0.48 Well, I wouldn't change the $10 bill, I'd change the $20.
0.22 I'd take Jackson off and I'd leave Alexander Hamilton right where he is as one of our Founding Fathers.
0.18 And I very much agree with Marco that it should be Rosa Parks.
0.29 She was a principled pioneer that helped change this country, helped remedy racial injustice, and that would be an honor that would be entirely appropriate.
0.10 You know, as a Cuban, I might go with Cohiba (ph), and I'll tell you, I'd go with, for Heidi, Angel, because she is my angel.
0.22 If I'm elected president our friends and allies across the globe will know that we stand with them.
0.31 the bust of Winston Churchill will be back in the Oval Office, and the American embassy in Israel will be in Jerusalem.
0.19 Enemies across this world will know the United States is not to be trifled with.
0.20 ISIS will be defeated.
0.30 We will have a president willing to utter the words, "radical Islamic terrorism," and the Ayatollah Khamenei will understand that he will never, ever, ever acquire nuclear weapons.
0.18 Here at home, we'll reignite the promise of America.
0.63 Young people coming out of school, with student loans up to their eyeballs, will find instead of no jobs, two, three, four, five job opportunities.
0.06 How will that happen?
0.32 Through tax reform.
0.25 We'll pass a simple flat tax and abolish the IRS.
0.23 And through regulatory reform, we will repeal every word of Obamacare.
0.12 You want to know what I'll do as president?
0.16 It is real simple.
0.29 We'll kill the terrorists, we'll repeal Obamacare, and we will defend the Constitution, every single word of it.
0.22 Hi, I'm Ben Carson, and I'm a retired pediatric neurosurgeon.
0.32 I'm here with my wife, Candy, of 40 years, and two of my sons, and their wives.
0.34 I stress the pediatric part of my career because the reason that I've gotten involved in this race is because I'm very concerned about the future of our children, and the direction of our country is one that does not portend well, unless we, the people, intervene and retake our rightful place at the pinnacle.
0.06 And I just want to be -- make it clear that I'm grateful to be here with all of you again, and welcome the addition of Carly Fiorina, as well.
0.25 Typically, politicians do things that are politically expedient.
0.27 And they are looking for whatever their particular goal is.
0.20 That is not the reason that I have gotten into this thing.
0.24 I'm extraordinary concerned about the direction of this country, the divisiveness that is going on, fiscal irresponsibility, the failure to take a leadership position in the world.
0.17 All of those things will lead to a situation where the next generation will not have a chance that we've had now.
0.07 So I don't -- I don't want to really get into describing who's a politician and who's not a politician, but I think the people have kind of made that decision for themselves already, and will continue to do so as time goes on.
0.19 Jake, can I say something about that?You know, when I entered this race, all the political pundits said it's impossible; you can't do it because you're not connected with the money.
0.16 And there's no way that you can raise what you need in order to compete successfully.
0.25 I in no way am willing to get in the bed with special interest group or lick the boots of billionaires.
0.16 I have said to the people if they want me to do this, please get involved.
0.66 And we now have over 500,000 donations, and the money is coming in.
0.26 But the pundits forgot about one thing, and that is the people.
0.27 And they are really in charge.
0.25 If we don't seal the border, the rest of this stuff clearly doesn't matter.
0.16 It's kind of ridiculous all the other things we talk about.
0.22 We have the ability to do it, we don't have the will to do it.
0.39 There was one area where they had cut a hole in the fence, and to repair it, they put a few strands of barb wire across.
0.38 Well, the photographers who were there with us, they wanted to photograph us from the side of the Mexicans, and they went through there, and they were not physically fit people, and they took their cameras and things with them, and shot us from the other side.
0.10 That's how easy it is to get across.
0.22 And, the drugs, I mean, it goes on, and on, and on.
0.47 ICE tells them to release these people, 67,000 criminals released... ...on to our property, it's ridiculous.
0.12 Well, I have also said, if anybody knows how to do that, that I would be willing to listen.
0.09 And, if they can, you know, specify exactly how that's going to be done, and what the cost, and it sounds reasonable, then I think it's worth discussing... Not exactly what I said.
0.40 Well, what I said, after we seal the borders, after we turn off the spigot that dispenses all the goodies so we don't have people coming in here, including employment, that people who had a pristine record, we should consider allowing them to become guest workers, primarily in the agricultural sphere, because that's the place where Americans don't seem to want to work.
0.21 That's what I said.
0.21 And they have a six-month period to do that.
0.21 If they don't do it within that time period, then they become illegal, and as illegals, they will be treated as such.
0.12 Can I -- can I -- can I just... Can I correct... My plan is not amnesty for a number of reasons.
0.36 Number one, you know, I've talked to farmers, and they said they cannot hire Americans to do the kind of job that I'm talking about.
0.24 And the second reason is because the individuals who register as guest workers, they don't get to vote, they are not American citizens, and they don't get the rights and privileges of American citizens.
0.14 So that's key.
0.15 But the other thing that I want to bring up is, I mentioned something earlier.
0.24 I think it was just sort of glossed over.
0.29 I talked about the success in Yuma County, I mean, incredible success, and the Department of Justice said, "No, we don't want to do that.
0.17 That's too successful.
0.17 "We don't have to keep reinventing the wheel.
0.18 All we have to do is look at things that work.
0.26 All we have to do is use a little common sense.
0.17 It's all about America.
0.61 You know, the people who say the guy who paid a billion dollars because he had 10, he has still got $9 billion left, that's not fair, we need to take more of his money.
0.21 That's called socialism.
0.12 That doesn't work so well.
0.69 What made America into a great nation was the fact that we said, that guy just put in $1 billion, let's create an environment that's even more conducive to his success so that next year he can put in $2 billion.
0.13 And that's the kind of thing that helps us to grow.
0.21 We can't grow by continuing to take a piece of pie, and dividing it, and redistributing it.
0.17 But, I'm also looking at what doctor -- at what Governor Huckabee talked about...
0.27 The Fair Tax.
0.30 Looking at both of them, and evaluating them both, and I'm talking to the American people because one of the things we must recognize is that this country is of, for, and by the people.
0.08 And, it's really time that the government get out of the way, and let the people be the ones who decide how they want to run their country.
0.19 Well, first of all, let me say what I actually said about raising the minimum wage.
0.27 I was asked should it be raised, I said, probably, or possibly.
0.08 But, what I added, which I think is the most important thing, so, I said we need to get both sides of this issue to sit down, and talk about it.
0.31 Negotiate a reasonable minimum wage, and index that so that we never have to have this conversation again in the history of America.
0.20 I think we also have to have two minimum wages, a starter, and a sustaining because how are young people ever going to get a job if you have such a high minimum wage that it makes it impractical to hire them... Jake, Jake...
0.42 I haven't had an opportunity to weigh in on foreign policy, and I just want to mention that when the war, when the issue occurred in 2003, I suggested to President Bush that he not go to war?
0.22 OK.
0.18 So I just want that on the record.
0.29 And, you know, a lot of people are very much against us getting involved right now with global jihadism.
0.20 And they refer back to our invasion of Iraq.
0.14 And they seem to think that that was what caused it.
0.25 What caused it was withdrawing from there and creating a vacuum which allowed this terrible situation to occur.
0.16 But it is very different from what is going on today.
0.20 We're talking about global jihadists who actually want to destroy us.
0.18 They are an existential threat to our nation.
0.16 And we have to be mature enough to recognize that our children will have no future if we put our heads in the sand.
0.28 We have to recognize we have two choices.
0.31 We either allow them the continue to progress and appear to be the winners, or we use every resource available to us to destroy... ... them first.
0.28 Well, recognize that, you know, President George W. Bush is a great friend of ours, and we spent many wonderful days at the White House.
0.27 I haven't been there in the last seven years.
0.15 I probably have to have a food-tester.
0.24 But at any rate, I didn't suggest that nothing be done.
0.36 What I suggested to President Bush is to be Kennedy-esque, in the sense that when the Russians got ahead of us in the space race, what we did is use the bully pulpit to galvanize everybody, business, industry, academia behind a national goal to put a man on the moon and bring him back safely.
0.13 I said, you can do the same kind of thing.
0.43 Declare that within five to 10 years we will become petroleum independent.
0.42 The moderate Arab states would have been so concerned about that, they would have turned over Osama bin Laden and anybody else you wanted on a silver platter within two weeks.
0.22 There are smart ways to do things and there are muscular ways to do things.
0.19 And sometimes you have to look at both of those to come up with the right solution.
0.16 I have no argument with having a strong leader, and to be aggressive where aggression is needed.
0.26 But it is not needed in every circumstance.
0.19 There is a time when you can use your intellect to come up with other ways to do things.
0.11 And I think that's what we have to start thinking about.
0.28 There is no question that a lot of these problems that we have been talking about in terms of the international situation is because we are weak.
0.23 It is because our Navy is so small.
0.38 It is because our Air Force is incapable of doing the same things that it did a few years ago.
0.33 It's because our Marines Corps is not ready to be deployed.
0.25 There are a lot of problems that are going on, and we need to solve those problems, we need to build up our military... Well, let me put it this way, there has -- there have been numerous studies, and they have not demonstrated that there is any correlation between vaccinations and autism.
0.50 This was something that was spread widely 15 or 20 years ago, and it has not been adequately, you know, revealed to the public what's actually going on.
0.27 Vaccines are very important.
0.26 Certain ones.
0.19 The ones that would prevent death or crippling.
0.26 There are others, there are a multitude of vaccines which probably don't fit in that category, and there should be some discretion in those cases.
0.23 But, you know, a lot of this is -- is -- is pushed by big government.
0.11 And I think that's one of the things that people so vehemently want to get rid of, big government.
0.57 You know, we have 4.1 million federal employees.
0.32 Six hundred and fifty federal agencies and department (sic).That's why they have to take so much of our taxes.
0.21 TAPPER: Should he stop saying it?
0.24 Should he stop saying that vaccines cause autism?Well, you know, I've just explained it to him.
0.18 He can read about it if he wants to.
0.13 I think he's an intelligent man and will make the correct decision after getting the real facts.
0.17 And a lot of pediatricians now recognize that, and, I think, are cutting down on the number and the proximity in which those are done, and I think that's appropriate.
0.12 I'd put my mother on there.
0.53 You know, she was one of 24 children, got married at age 13, had only a third grade education, had to raise two sons by herself, refused to be a victim.
0.21 Wouldn't let us be victims, and has been an inspiration to many people.
0.23 Well, you know, I was a radical Democrat before I started listening to Ronald Reagan.
0.26 And he didn't sound like what they said Republicans were.
0.35 He sounded logical.
0.16 And I hope that I sound logical also.
0.15 Because when I look at what is going on with the United States of America, I see a lot of things that are not logical.
0.19 I see us allowing people to divide us, when in fact our strength is in our unity.
0.28 I see people exercising the most irresponsible fiscal habits that anyone could possibly do.
0.20 And hiding it from the American people, so that the majority of people have no idea what our financial situation is.
0.36 So, when someone comes along and says, free college, free phones, free this and that, and the other, they say, "wow, that's nice," having no idea that they're destabilizing our position.
0.31 And I think also that Ronald Reagan was a master at understanding that a pinnacle nation has to be a nation that leads.
0.15 If we learn to lead in the Middle East right now, a coalition will form behind us, but never they do it if we just sit there and talk about it.
0.09 Real leadership is what I would hopefully bring to America.
0.18 Well, first of all, Rand Paul shouldn't even be on this stage.
0.46 He's number 11, he's got 1 percent in the polls, and how he got up here, there's far too many people anyway.
0.17 As far as temperament -- and we all know that -- as far as temperament, I think I have a great temperament.
0.41 I built a phenomenal business with incredible, iconic assets, one of the really truly great real-estate businesses.
0.17 And I may be an entertainer, because I've had tremendous success with number-one bestsellers all over the place, with "The Apprentice" and everything else I've done.
0.59 But I will tell you this: What I am far and away greater than an entertainer is a businessman, and that's the kind of mindset this country needs to bring it back, because we owe $19 trillion right now, $19 trillion, and you need this kind of thinking to bring our country back.
0.14 And believe me, my temperament is very good, very calm.
0.15 But we will be respected outside of this country.
0.24 We are not respected now.
0.18 I never attacked him on his look, and believe me, there's plenty of subject matter right there.
0.12 But I have to say...WALKER This is actually what's wrong -- this is what's wrong with this debate.
0.18 We're not talking about real issues.
0.10 And Mr. Trump, we don't need an apprentice in the White House.
0.08 We don't need an apprentice in the White House.
0.24 We have one right now.
0.35 He told us all the things we wanted to hear back in 2008.
0.09 We don't know who you are or where you're going.
0.11 We need someone who can actually get the job done.
0.08 Well, in Wisconsin...WALKER You -- you -- let me finish...
0.17 Excuse me.
0.28 WALKER You're using the talking...
0.12 I would do so much better than that.
0.28 WALKER Mr. Trump, you're using the talking points of the Democrats... No.
0.15 WALKER ... and as we all know...
0.24 I'm using facts.
0.55 WALKER ... that failed three times in four and a half years when I got elected, because it is working.
0.43 We balanced a budget.
0.19 You want to talk about balanced budgets?
0.41 You took four major projects into bankruptcy over and over and over again.
0.17 You can't take America into bankruptcy.
0.16 That's what's wrong with the politicians in Washington right now.
0.19 They think we can take a country into bankruptcy.into bankruptcy.
0.15 That's what's wrong with politicians in Washington right now.
0.17 They think we can take a country into bankruptcy.
0.43 Every major business leader, has used the -- I never went bank bankrupt, by the way, as you know, everybody knows.
0.49 But -- hundreds of companies, hundreds of deals, I used the law four times and made a tremendous thing.
0.25 I'm in business.
0.22 I did a very good job.
0.17 But I will say this, and people are very, very impressed with what I've done, the business people.
0.35 But when the folks of Iowa found out the true facts of the job that you've done in Wisconsin, all of a sudden you, tubed (ph), he was No.
0.27 1 and now he's No.
0.29 6 or seven in the polls.
0.14 I promise I would have gotten it.
0.14 I promise if I wanted it, I would have gotten it.
0.21 No.
0.13 I just will tell you that, you know, Jeb made the statement.
0.24 I'm not only referring to him.
0.35 I -- a lot of money was raised by a lot of different people that are standing up here.
0.21 And the donors, the special interests, the lobbyists have very strong power over these people.
0.30 I'm spending all of my money, I'm not spending -- I'm not getting any -- I turned down -- I turn down so much, I could have right now from special interests and donors, I could have double and triple what he's got.
0.27 I've turned it down.
0.62 I turned down last week $5 million from somebody.
0.11 So I will tell you I understand the game, I've been on the other side all of my life.
0.24 And they have a lot of control over our politicians.
0.09 And I don't say that favorably, and I'm not sure if there's another system, but I say this.
0.16 I am not accepting any money from anybody.
0.29 Nobody has control of me other than the people of this country.
0.10 I'm going to do the right thing.
0.39 I was a businessman, I got along with Clinton, I got along with everybody.
0.23 That was my job, to get along with people.
0.15 I didn't want to -- excuse me.
0.30 One second.
0.16 OK, more energy tonight.
0.13 I like that.
0.22 I didn't want -- it was my obligation as a businessman to my family, to my company, to my employees, to get along with all politicians.
0.30 I get along with all of them, and I did a damn good job in doing it.
0.22 Go ahead.
0.23 Don't make things up.
0.24 Jeb, don't make things up.
0.27 Come on.
0.18 So, number one, they have to respect you.
0.35 He has absolutely no respect for President Obama.
0.23 Zero.
0.29 Syria's a mess.
0.13 You look at what's going on with ISIS in there, now think of this: we're fighting ISIS.
0.26 ISIS wants to fight Syria.
0.32 Why are we fighting ISIS in Syria?
0.34 Let them fight each other and pick up the remnants.
0.08 I would talk to him.
0.20 I would get along with him.
0.20 I believe -- and I may be wrong, in which case I'd probably have to take a different path, but I would get along with a lot of the world leaders that this country is not getting along with.
0.29 We don't get along with China.
0.33 We don't get along with the heads of Mexico.
0.24 We don't get along with anybody, and yet, at the same time, they rip us left and right.
0.22 They take advantage of us economically and every other way.
0.29 We get along with nobody.
0.12 I will get along -- I think -- with Putin, and I will get along with others, and we will have a much more stable -- stable world.
0.26 I believe that I will get along -- we will do -- between that, Ukraine, all of the other problems, we won't have the kind of problems that our country has right now with Russia and many other nations.
0.21 TAPPER: Senator Rubio, you've taken a very different approach to the -- the question of Russia.
0.23 You've called Vladimir Putin a, quote, "gangster.
0.28 "Why would President Rubio's approach be more effective than President Trump's?I wouldn't have drawn the line, but once he drew it, he had no choice but to go across.
0.13 They do bear some responsibility, but I think he probably didn't do it, not for that reason.
0.29 Somehow, he just doesn't have courage.
0.18 There is something missing from our president.
0.46 Had he crossed the line and really gone in with force, done something to Assad -- if he had gone in with tremendous force, you wouldn't have millions of people displaced all over the world.
0.19 They had a responsibility, absolutely.
0.19 I think we have three of them here...
0.20 I think they had a responsibility, yes.
0.11 Jeb, just...
0.08 I think it will haunt him.
0.12 I think it's a terrible.
0.09 I think it's going to haunt him absolutely.
0.33 He came back later and he said he misspoke.
0.21 There was no question because I heard when he said the statement.
0.29 I was watching and he said the statement.
0.12 And I said, wow, I can't believe it.
0.31 I will take care of women.
0.44 I respect women.
0.31 I will take care of women.
0.09 One thing we will say and I would like to get back to the Iran situation.
0.30 We're talking about Iran.
0.34 The agreement was terrible.
0.23 It was incompetent.
0.21 I've never seen anything like it.
0.30 One of the worst contracts of any kind I've ever seen.
0.21 And nobody ever mentions North Korea where you have this maniac sitting there and he actually has nuclear weapons and somebody better start thinking about North Korea and perhaps a couple of other places.
0.18 But certainly North Korea.
0.35 And Ted and I have spoken.
0.37 We've -- a lot of us have spoken.
0.30 We're talking about Iran.
0.21 They are bad actors, bad things are going to happen.
0.28 But in the meantime, you have somebody right now in North Korea who has got nuclear weapons and who is saying almost every other week, I'm ready to use them.
0.21 And we don't even mention it.
0.16 So why didn't you say it?
0.21 Why didn't you say it?I know, but why did you say it?
0.17 I heard it myself.
0.53 Why did you say it?You said you're going to cut funding for women's health.
0.27 You said it.
0.11 I think she's got a beautiful face, and I think she's a beautiful woman.
0.18 Correct.
0.22 First of all, I want to build a wall, a wall that works.
0.17 So important, and it's a big part of it.
0.17 Second of all, we have a lot of really bad dudes in this country from outside, and I think Chris knows that, maybe as well as anybody.
0.29 They go, if I get elected, first day they're gone.
0.24 Gangs all over the place.
0.18 Chicago, Baltimore, no matter where you look.
0.41 We have a country based on laws.
0.25 I will make sure that those laws are adhered to.
0.35 These are illegal immigrants.
0.27 I don't think you'd even be asking this question if I didn't run because when I ran, and I brought this up, my opening remarks at Trump Tower, I took heat like nobody has taken heat in a long time.
0.37 And, then they found out with the killing of Katie, from San Francisco, and so many other crimes, they found out that I was right.
0.19 And, most people, many people, apologized to me.
0.21 I don't think you'd even be talking about illegal immigration if it weren't for me.
0.20 So, we have a country of laws, they're going to go out, and they'll come back if they deserve to come back.
0.36 If they've had a bad record, if they've been arrested, if they've been in jail, they're never coming back.
0.18 We're going to have a country again.
0.18 Right now, we don't have a country, we don't have a border, and we're going to do something about it, and it can be done with proper management, and it can be done with heart.
0.10 Well, I have to tell you, I hear phenomenal things.
0.12 I hear your wife is a lovely woman...
0.08 I don't know her, and this is a total mischaracterization... Good.
0.11 No, I won't do that, because I've said nothing wrong.
0.14 But I do hear she's a lovely woman.
0.34 Jeb said... ... that they come into our country as an act of love.
0.30 With all of the problems we that we have, in so many instances -- we have wonderful people coming in.
0.19 But with all of the problems -- this is not an act of love.
0.23 He's weak on immigration -- by the way, in favor of Common Core, which is also a disaster, but weak on immigration.
0.78 As I said, we are spending $200 billion -- we are spending $200 billion a year on maintaining what we have.
0.19 We will move them out.
0.22 The great ones will come back, the good ones will come back.
0.22 They'll be expedited, they'll be back, they'll come back legally.
0.31 We'll have a country -- they'll come back, legally.
0.16 Well, I think it's wonderful and all, but I did it a little bit half-heartedly, but I do mean it to a large extent.
0.17 We have a country, where, to assimilate, you have to speak English.
0.11 And I think that where he was, and the way it came out didn't sound right to me.
0.26 We have to have assimilation -- to have a country, we have to have assimilation.
0.23 I'm not the first one to say this, Dana.
0.33 We've had many people over the years, for many, many years, saying the same thing.
0.19 This is a country where we speak English, not Spanish.
0.18 This is a reporter, not a high school kid.
0.29 Well, first of all, the -- the 14th Amendment says very, very clearly to a lot of great legal scholars -- not television scholars, but legal scholars -- that it is wrong.
0.19 It can be corrected with an act of Congress, probably doesn't even need that.
0.20 A woman gets pregnant.
0.45 She's nine months, she walks across the border, she has the baby in the United States, and we take care of the baby for 85 years.
0.04 I don't think so.
0.25 The 14th Amendment, it reads properly, you can go and -- it's probably going to be have to be check -- go through a process of court, probably ends up at the Supreme Court, but there are a lot of great legal scholars that say that is not correct.
0.69 And in my opinion, it makes absolutely no -- we're the only -- one of the only countries, we're going to take care of those babies for 70, 75, 80, 90 years?
0.04 I don't think so.
0.30 I agree 100 percent, by the way, with Carly on the fact that the Democrats do not want to solve this problem, for the obvious reasons, but they do not.
0.14 But I believe that a reading of the 14th Amendment allows you to have an interpretation where this is not legal and where it can't be done.
0.22 I've seen both sides, but some of the greatest scholars agree with me, without having to go through Congress.
0.13 If you do go through Congress, you can absolutely solve the problem.
0.17 TAPPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump.
0.13 Senator Paul... That's true, sure.-- let me -- well, let me just explain.
0.68 The head of the Yale Business School, Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, wrote a paper recently, one of the worst tenures for a CEO that he has ever seen, ranked one of the top 20 in the history of business.
0.22 The company is a disaster and continues to be a disaster.
0.31 They still haven't recovered.
0.52 In fact, today, on the front page of the Wall Street Journal, they fired another 25 or 30,000 people saying we still haven't recovered from the catastrophe.
0.48 When Carly says the revenues went up, that's because she bought Compaq, it was a terrible deal, and it really led to the destruction of the company.
0.29 Now one other company before that was Lucent.
0.22 Carly was at Lucent before that.
0.23 And Lucent turned out to be a catastrophe also.
0.18 So I only say this.
0.16 She can't run any of my companies.
0.13 That I can tell you.
0.15 I'll tell you why; it's very simple.
0.21 I'll tell you.
0.56 I was running ---- I've made over $10 billion.
0.33 I had a casino company -- Caesars just filed for bankruptcy.
0.19 Chris will tell you -- it's not Chris' fault either -- but almost everybody in Atlantic City is either in trouble or filed for -- maybe I'll blame Chris.
0.24 Wait a minute, Carly.
0.22 Wait.
0.16 I let you speak.
0.26 Atlantic City is a disaster, and I did great in Atlantic City.
0.15 I knew when to get out.
0.20 My timing was great.
0.18 And I got a lot of credit for it.
0.21 Many of the great business people that you know -- and Carl Icon (ph) is going to work with me on making great deals for this country.
0.10 But whether it's Carl or so many others that we read about all the time ---- they have used the laws of the land, which is the --...Well, I'd like to respond, I'd like to respond... Well, I think the thing about the flat tax, I know it very well.
0.74 What I don't like is that if you make $200 million a year, you pay ten percent, you're paying very little relatively to somebody that's making $50,000 a year, and has to hire H&R Block to do the -- because it's so complicated.
0.28 One thing I'll say to Ben is that we've had a graduated tax system for many years, so it's not a socialistic thing.
0.21 What I'd like to do, and I'll be putting in the plan in about two weeks, and I think people are going to like it, it's a major reduction in taxes.
0.37 It's a major reduction for the middle class.
0.15 The hedge fund guys won't like me as much as they like me right now.
0.19 I know them all, but they'll pay more.
0.27 I know people that are making a tremendous amount of money and paying virtually no tax, and I think it's unfair.
0.31 Well, I heard Hugh Hewitt, a nice man, he apologized because he actually said that we had a misunderstanding.
0.37 And he said today that Donald Trump is maybe the best interview there is anywhere that he has ever done.
0.34 Now unless he was just saying that on CNN to be nice, but he did say that... And we had a legitimate misunderstanding in terms of his pronunciation of a word.
0.05 But I would say just... Well, I think it was.
0.31 And he actually said that.
0.31 Did you say that?OK.
0.33 So I will say this, though, Hugh was giving me name after name, Arab name, Arab name, and there are few people anywhere, anywhere that would have known those names.
0.17 I think he was reading them off a sheet.
0.20 And frankly I will have -- and I told him, I will have the finest team that anybody has put together and we will solve a lot of problems.
0.14 You know, right now they know a lot and look at what is happening.
0.44 The world is blowing up around us.
0.20 We will have great teams and great people.
0.16 I hope that answers your question.
0.17 I mean, you are in the Senate, but I hope that answers your question.
0.11 No, I don't think he's suggesting that at all.
0.17 I mean...
0.11 I don't think he's suggesting that at all.
0.32 Well, you have to understand, I am not sitting in the United States Senate with, by the way, the worst voting record there is today.
0.16 Number one.
0.19 I am not sitting in the United States Senate.
0.33 I'm a businessman doing business transactions.
0.25 I am doing business transactions.
0.23 I will know more about this -- and, as you said, that was very acceptable, and when you listen to that whole interview, it's a great interview, you said it, I didn't.
0.19 Well, now I did.
0.13 But...
0.26 Listen, just one second.
0.27 Just one second.
0.07 I will know...
0.11 ...I will know more about the problems of this world by the time I sit, and you look at what's going in this world right now by people that supposedly know, this world is a mess.
0.35 TAPPER: Senator Rubio, he did invoke your absentee record in the Senate.
0.18 (inaudible) I'm -- and I'm meeting with people that are terrific people, but I have to say something because it's about judgment.
0.19 In fact, a delegation was sent to my office to see me because I was so vocal about it.
0.22 I'm a very militaristic person, but you have to know when to use the military.
0.39 I'm the only person up here that fought against going into Iraq.
0.18 Just excuse me, one second, Rand...
0.35 If you don't mind, Rand -- you know, you are on last -- you do have your 1 percent.
0.06 I would like -- and I think it's very important.
0.10 I think it's important, because it's about judgment.
0.18 It's about judgment.
0.30 I didn't want to go into Iraq, and I fought it, because what I said -- what I said... ... was you're going to -- you're going to destabilize... ... the Middle East, and that's what happened.
0.05 If you think about it...
0.54 Your brother -- and your brother's administration gave us Barack Obama, because it was such a disaster, those last three months, that Abraham Lincoln couldn't have been elected.
0.12 I don't know.
0.23 You feel safe right now?
0.16 I don't feel so safe.
0.17 Speaking for myself, I'm OK with it.
0.13 I think there's a certain truth to it.
0.16 I know people that, frankly, it has no impact on their life whatsoever.
0.27 There are many people.
0.14 I would almost say leave it up to them, but I would be willing to check it off, and say I will not get Social Security.
0.17 I do not... As a policy, I would almost leave it up to the people.
0.14 Don't forget they pay in and they pay in, and maybe they do well, and maybe some people want it.
0.21 But the fact is that there are people that truly don't need it, and there are many people that do need it very, very badly.
0.44 And I would be willing to write mine off 100 percent, Dana.
0.13 BASH: So is a voluntary program the way to get the Social Security system solvent again like that.
0.08 Well, I -- I -- I'd like to respond.
0.21 Autism has become an epidemic.
0.46 Twenty-five years ago, 35 years ago, you look at the statistics, not even close.
0.36 It has gotten totally out of control.
0.31 I am totally in favor of vaccines.
0.26 But I want smaller doses over a longer period of time.
0.41 Because you take a baby in -- and I've seen it -- and I've seen it, and I had my children taken care of over a long period of time, over a two or three year period of time.
0.17 Same exact amount, but you take this little beautiful baby, and you pump -- I mean, it looks just like it's meant for a horse, not for a child, and we've had so many instances, people that work for me.
0.39 I only say it's not -- I'm in favor of vaccines, do them over a longer period of time, same amount.
0.07 I think -- and I think you're going to have -- I think you're going to see a big impact on autism.
0.26 And that's all I'm saying, Jake.
0.25 That's all I'm saying.
0.17 Well, because she's been sitting for three hours, I think my daughter, Ivanka, who's right here.
0.35 Other than that we'll go with Rosa Parks.
0.13 I like that.
0.10 If I become president, we will do something really special.
0.26 We will make this country greater than ever before.
0.38 We'll have more jobs.
0.27 We'll have more of everything.
0.29 We were discussing disease, we were discussing all sorts of things tonight, many of which will just be words, it will just pass on.
0.08 I don't want to say politicians, all talk, no action.
0.19 But a lot of what we talked about is words and it will be forgotten very quickly.
0.22 If I'm president, many of the things that we discussed tonight will not be forgotten.
0.20 We'll find solutions.
0.24 And the world will respect us.
0.25 They will respect us like never before.
0.16 And it will be actually a friendlier world.
0.10 And I have to say, it is a great honor to be here tonight.
0.13 I'm Jeb Bush, and I believe America's on the verge of its greatest century, and I'm ready to lead.
0.47 I'm a committed, conservative reformer that cut taxes, that balanced budgets, that took on the special interest in Florida, and we won.
0.10 I look forward to talking tonight about how we can fix a broken Washington D.C., and create an environment where people can rise up again in this great country.
0.09 I think the voters will make that determination.
0.23 And that requires a steadiness.
0.18 That requires an understanding of how the world works.
0.21 That requires an understanding and appreciation of American leadership in the world.
0.13 You can't just, you know, talk about this stuff and insult leaders around the world and expect a good result.
0.11 You have to do this with a steady hand, and I believe I have those skills.
0.17 WALKER Jake, this is -- this is -- this is... No.
0.16 Absolutely not.
0.61 People are supporting me because I have a proven record of conservative leadership where I cut taxes $19 billion over eight years.
0.60 We shrunk the state government workforce, we created a climate that led the nation in job growth seven out of eight years.
0.32 We were one of two states to go to AAA bond rating.
0.08 People know that we need principle-centered leadership, a disrupter to go to Washington, D.C.
0.37 The one guy that had some special interests that I know of that tried to get me to change my views on something -- that was generous and gave me money -- was Donald Trump.
0.36 He wanted casino gambling in Florida --You wanted it and you didn't get it because I was opposed to --during and after.
0.16 And that's not -- I'm not going to be bought by anybody.-- because you gave her money.
0.19 Maybe it works for Hillary Clinton ---- it doesn't work for anybody on this -- on stage.
0.21 No.
0.36 The simple fact is, Donald, you could not take --So he supports Pelosi, he supports Schumer, he supports Clinton --When he -- and he -- when he asked -- when he asked Florida to have casino gambling, we said no.
0.30 We said no.
0.19 And that's the simple fact.
0.08 The simple fact is --No, I don't think so, but we need to be strong against China.
0.29 We should use offensive tactics as it relates to cyber security, send a deterrent signal to China.
0.45 There should be super sanctions in what President Obama has proposed.
0.32 There's many other tools that we have without canceling a dinner.
0.13 That's not going to change anything, but we can be much stronger as it relates to that.
0.34 As it relates to Iran, it's not a strategy to tear up an agreement.
0.12 A strategy would be how do we confront Iran?
0.37 And, the first thing that we need to do is to establish our commitment to Israel which has been altered by this administration.
0.30 And, make sure that they have the most sophisticated weapons to send a signal to Iran that we have Israel's back.
0.19 If we do that, it's going to create a healthier deterrent effect than anything else I can think of.
0.13 I don't think -- you're not stating my views right.
0.10 I think there needs to be accommodation for someone acting on faith.
0.30 Religious conscience is -- is -- is a first freedom.
0.28 It's -- it's a powerful part of our -- of our Bill of Rights.
0.33 And, in a big, tolerant country, we should respect the rule of law, allow people in -- in -- in this country -- I'm a -- I was opposed to the decision, but we -- you can't just say, "well, they -- gays can't get married now.
0.16 "But this woman, there should be some accommodation for her conscience, just as there should be for people that are florists that don't want to participate in weddings, or bakers.
0.11 A great country like us should find a way to have accommodations for people so that we can solve the problem in the right way.
0.17 This should be solved at the local level... And so we do agree, Mike.
0.12 Well, he's wrong on a lot of things, but on this he's wrong because I'm the most pro-life governor on this stage.
0.23 I got to act on my core beliefs.
0.15 It's part of who I am.
0.17 Life is a gift from God.
0.14 And from beginning end we need to respect it and err on the side of life.
0.27 And so I defunded Planned Parenthood.
0.33 We created a climate where parental notification took place.
0.55 We were the only state to fund crisis pregnancy centers with state moneys.
0.35 We were totally focused on this.
0.09 And I would bring that kind of philosophy to Washington, D.C.So here is a solution to this.
0.32 Title X of the HHS funding, there is something that was the "Reagan Rule."
0.42 It was passed in 1988.
0.48 And in that rule it was defined, and the courts approved this, that a Planned Parenthood, you couldn't separate the money between the actual abortion procedures, and there are 330,000 abortions that take place in this clinic, and their promotion of it.
0.55 He interpreted it the right way, the courts ruled in his favor, and Planned Parenthood did not get funding during that time until President Clinton came in.
0.23 When I'm elected president, we will restore that interpretation of Title X.
0.16 And this deal will be finished.
0.66 There are 13,000 community-based organizations that provide health services to women, 13,000 in this country.
0.23 I don't believe that Planned Parenthood should get a penny from the federal government.
0.55 Those organizations should get funding, just as I increased funding when I was governor of the state.
0.19 That's the way you do this is you improve the condition for people.
0.48 And, Donald, when I was governor, we also increased the opportunities for women.
0.70 Women's income grew three times faster than the national average when I was governor.-- we increased child support -- we increased child support with a broken system by 90 percent.
0.35 I have a proven record.
0.35 I have a proven record.
0.34 He did, he did.
0.10 You're proud of your family, just as I am.
0.16 To subject my wife into the middle of a raucous political conversation was completely inappropriate, and I hope you apologize for that, Donald.
0.06 She is absolutely the love of my life, and she's right here... And why don't you apologize to her right now.
0.15 So, here's the deal.
0.18 My wife is a Mexican-American.
0.19 She's an American by choice.
0.21 She loves this country as much as anybody in this room, and she wants a secure border.
0.14 But she wants to embrace the traditional American values that make us special and make us unique.
0.26 We're at a crossroads right now.
0.30 Are we going to take the Reagan approach, the hopeful optimistic approach, the approach that says that, you come to our country legally, you pursue your dreams with a vengeance, you create opportunities for all of us?Or the Donald Trump approach?
0.30 The approach that says that everything is bad, that everything is coming to an end.
0.15 I...
0.16 I'm on the Reagan side of this.
0.14 Well, I've been speaking English here tonight, and I'll keep speaking English.
0.27 Even though they do speak English, and even though they embrace American values.
0.27 Well, first of all, Hugh, if you're looking at Republican advisers, you have to go to the last two administrations.
0.47 That happened to be 41 and 43.
0.31 So just by definition, if you're -- and many of the people here that are seeking advice from the foreign policy experts in the Republican side, they -- they served in my dad's administration, my brother's administration.
0.20 Of course that's the case.
0.21 But I'm my own man.
0.21 I'm going to create a strategy that is based on the simple fact that the United States needs to lead the world.
0.18 The first thing that we need to do is to stop the craziness of the sequester.
0.20 Rebuild our military so that our -- so that we don't deploy people over and over again without the necessary equipment to keep them safe, to send a signal to the world that we're serious.
0.25 If we're going to lead the world, then we need to have the strongest military possible.
0.20 We need to rebuild our counterintelligence and intelligence capabilities.
0.40 We need to focus on the fact that the next president is going to start in 2017, not in 1990 -- you know, 30 years ago, or when my brother started.
0.30 The world is dramatically different.
0.09 And I believe that we need to restore America's presence and leadership in the world.
0.33 Name a country where our relationship is better today than it was the -- the day that Barack Obama got elected president.
0.44 Under Hillary Clinton, and Barack Obama, we have seen a weakness that now creates huge problems for the next president of the United States.
0.15 So I'll have a team that will be -- that will be following the doctrine I set up, and it will be peace through strength.
0.27 We're sitting here in this library, which is a wonderful place to talk about this, because that's exactly what happened in the 1980s, and the world was a lot safer because of...
0.14 The leadership of Ronald Reagan and my...
0.16 So you -- the -- the first chance...
0.18 Right after me, and then I'll -- I'll yield -- yield the floor.
0.30 What do you guys say in the Senate when you're talking and debating?Here's the facts: When Donald Trump talks about judgment, what was his position on who would've been the best negotiator to deal with Iran?
0.47 It wasn't a Republican; it was Hillary Clinton.
0.10 That's what you believe.
0.19 I mean, the lack of judgment and the lack of understanding about how the world works is really dangerous in this kind of time that we're saying.
0.23 So is that the judgment that you bring to the table, that Hillary Clinton... ... is a great negotiator, that she could bring about a better deal on Iran?You know what?
0.15 As it relates to my brother, there's one thing I know for sure.
0.42 He kept us safe.
0.13 I don't know if you remember... ... Donald... ... you remember the -- the rumble?
0.24 You remember the fire fighter with his arms around it?
0.33 He sent a clear signal that the United States would be strong and fight Islamic terrorism, and he did keep us safe.... because of what President Obama's done by pulling back.
0.26 Well, I'm surprised Senator Cruz would say that since he was as strong supporter of John Roberts at the time.
0.17 I will talk about what I will do as it relates to appointing Supreme Court Justices.
0.33 We need to make sure that we have justices that, with a proven experienced record of respect for upholding the constitution.
0.12 That is what we need.
0.26 We can't have -- the history in recent past is appoint people that have no experience so that you can't get attacked.
0.27 And, that makes it harder for people to have confidence that they won't veer off... John Roberts has made some really good decisions, for sure, but he did not have a proven, extensive record that would have made the clarity the important thing, and that's what we need to do.
0.24 And, I'm willing to fight for those nominees to make sure that they get passed.
0.12 You can't do it the politically expedient way anymore.
0.18 This is the culture in Washington.
0.14 You have to fight hard for these appointments.
0.15 This is perhaps the most important thing that the next president will do.
0.37 Well, first of all, he, as I said, supported John Roberts.
0.32 He supported him, publicly.
0.36 So, you can rewrite history, I guess, Ted, but the simple fact is that you supported him because he had all the criteria that you would have thought would have made a great justice.
0.16 And, I think he is doing a good job.
0.30 But, the simple fact is that going forward, what we need to do is to have someone that has a long standing set of rulings that consistently makes it clear that he is a focused, exclusively on upholding the Constitution of the United States so they won't try to use the bench as a means to which legislate.
0.17 Well, I -- I wanted to -- be -- make it easier for him.
0.45 So, 40 years ago, I smoked marijuana, and I admit it.
0.41 I'm sure that other people might have done it and may not want to say it in front of 25 million people.
0.19 My mom's not happy that I just did.
0.34 That's true.
0.22 And here's the deal.
0.22 Here's the deal.
0.26 We have -- we have a serious epidemic of drugs that goes way beyond marijuana.
0.24 What goes on in Colorado, as far as I'm concerned, that should be a state decision.
0.18 But if you look at the problem of drugs in this -- in this society today, it's a serious problem.
0.13 Rand, you know this because you're campaigning in New Hampshire like all of us, and you see the epidemic of heroin, the overdoses of heroin that's taking place.
0.28 People's families are -- are being torn apart.
0.40 It is appropriate for the government to play a consistent role to be able to provide more treatment, more prevention -- we're the state that has the most drug courts across every circuit in -- in -- in Florida, there are drug courts to give people a second chance.
0.09 That's the best way to do this.
0.12 No, you're wrong -- you're wrong about this.
0.22 Here's the deal.
0.31 No, I did not oppose when the legislature passed the bill to deal with that very issue.
0.11 That's the way to solve this problem.
0.46 Medical marijuana on the ballot was opened up, there was a huge loophole, it was the first step to getting to a (inaudible) place.
0.26 And as a citizen of Florida, I voted no.
0.26 I think we need to do this state by state.
0.23 There are places that get this right, and we need to make sure that we protect the privacy laws.
0.19 This is a complicated place.
0.50 But I do think the natural impulse on the left -- Hillary Clinton, immediately after one of these horrific violent acts took place, immediately said we need to have federal gun laws.
0.35 President Obama almost reflexively always says the same thing.
0.56 And the net result is, you're going to take away rights of -- of law-abiding citizens, the 99.999 percent of the people that are law- abiding citizens.
0.17 That's not the right approach to do it.
0.23 In Florida, we have a background check.
0.56 We have concealed-weapon permit holders, and in fact, there's 1,200,000 of them.
0.31 We have a reduction in violent crime because we put people behind bars when they use a gun in the commission of the crime.
0.16 That's the better approach.
0.22 But we're living in a society today where despair kind of grows in isolation.
0.10 I -- I think there needs to be a hearing, but the fact is, we need to encourage that kind of involvement.
0.18 That's -- that's exactly what we need to do.
0.17 I would go with Ronald Reagan's partner, Margaret Thatcher.
0.26 Probably illegal, but what the heck?Since it's not going to happen.
0.18 A strong leader is what we need in the White House, and she certainly was a strong leader that restored the United Kingdom into greatness.
0.18 Ever Ready, it's very high energy, Donald.
0.57 For the first time in modern history, more businesses are failing than are being created.
0.18 That is what the next president will have to deal with.
0.53 And I believe we can reverse course by creating a strategy of high sustained economic growth, not the new normal of 2 percent that all the left says we just have to get used to, but a 4 percent growth strategy where we reform how we tax, fix the broken regulatory system, embrace the energy revolution in our midst, fix the immigration system so we can turn it into an economic driver, deal with the structural fiscal problems that exist because of our entitlement problems that will overwhelm and create way too much debt.
0.44 If we grow at 4 percent, people are going to be lifted out of poverty.
0.24 The great middle that defines our country will have a chance to be able to pursue their dreams as they see fit.
0.16 That should be the great challenge and the great opportunity for the next president of the United States, to forge consensus to go back to a high-growth strategy.
0.35 And then we'll be able to lead the world.
0.20 Without a high-growth strategy, our country will never have the resources or the optimism to be able to lead the world, which the world desperately needs our leadership.
0.20 Good evening, I'm Scott Walker, and tonight, I want to thank and Mrs. Reagan, and the Reagan Library for hosting us.
0.24 You see, in my lifetime, the greatest president was a governor from California.
0.16 Ronald Reagan knew how to go big, and go bold.
0.35 He understood the essence of moving this country forward, and that's what I did when I took on the status quo in my state, and the Washington based special interest.
0.17 Now, more than ever, America needs a leader who will go big and bold again.
0.26 Someone who's been tested.
0.16 I'm ready to be that leader.
0.14 Thank you.
0.14 But Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake...
0.11 But Jake, this -- this is -- this... Jake, yeah, absolutely, I'll take this on, because this is an issue that's important in this race.
0.31 Just because he says it doesn't make it true.
0.19 The facts are the facts.
0.30 If you want someone that can actually take on the special interest of Washington, which you yourself said you were part of, using the system, we need somebody that will stand up and fight for average Americans to put them back in charge of their government.
0.16 I'm the one who is taking that on.
0.23 I'll do that as your next president.
0.41 Two parts to that, one on China, one back for a second on Iran.
0.41 When it comes to China, why would we be giving an official state visit to a country that's been involved in a massive cyber attack against the United States?
0.27 That's not just a visit, that's a 21 gun salute on the South Lawn of the White House.
0.20 It just doesn't make any sense.
0.45 If we're ever going to send a message to them, wouldn't this be the time, when they've issued this, sort of, massive attack against us?And, Jake, for the question, I was one of the first ones to call for terminating the bad deal with Iran on day one.
0.28 The President came after me and said I need to bone up.
0.34 You know, the President who called ISIS the JV squad said I needed to bone up.
0.31 The reality is it's a bad deal on day one, and it's a bad deal because this president has allowed Iran to go closer, and closer.
0.21 I'd love to play cards with this guy because Barack Obama folds on everything with Iran.
0.22 We need a leader who's going to stand up, and actually (INAUDIBLE)... Jake, just one more moment.
0.11 This is -- there's something bigger to this.
0.44 Now, I -- like so many other governors here, I defunded Planned Parenthood four-and-a-half years ago, in a Blue State.
0.32 But it's bigger than that.
0.51 We did that in a Blue State, we took the money and put it into women's health, so we did exactly what we're talking about here.
0.23 But I think the bigger issue here is we should be able to do this nationally, and this is precisely why so many Republicans are upset with Washington.
0.11 They see the House and they see the Senate and they say why can't we pass this.
0.34 Why can't we defund Planned -- put it in a spending bill.
0.45 Forget about the 60-vote rule, there's no reason -- and the Constitution doesn't call for 60 votes.
0.40 Pass it with 51 votes, put it on the desk of the president ---- and go forward and actually make a point.
0.27 This is why --So, the best way to help people see their wages go up is to get them the education, the skill they need, to take on careers that pay more than minimum wage.
0.20 And, it's why we talk about it, it's all about jobs.
0.27 You want to help actually get jobs, it's why on that last question we were trying to jump in on taxes.
0.15 To me, it's not just about taxes, cutting taxes.
0.25 I've done it as much as anyone has.
0.42 I've cut income taxes, I've cut property taxes.
0.57 In fact, property taxes are lower today in my state than they were before we took office.
0.20 The real issues about jobs.
0.56 Ronald Reagan, our plan is based on the Ronald Reagan tax cuts of 1986.
0.59 That brought about one of the longest sustained periods of economic growth in American history.
0.13 All the things we should be talking about tonight are about how do we create jobs, helping people get the skills and the education qualifications they need to succeed.
0.24 That's the way you help people create jobs.
0.23 It's part of our large plan to reform the tax code, to cut taxes, to put in place an education system that gives people the skills and education that they need.
0.19 To put in place all the above energy policy, but you start on day one with repealing Obamacare.
0.41 I'm the only one on this stage that's actually got a plan, introduced an actual plan to repeal Obamacare on day one.
0.19 I'll send a bill up to Congress, and to make sure enact it...
0.26 ...I'm going to sign an order that makes the Congress live by the same rules as everybody else.
0.18 TAPPER: ...Thank you, Governor... ...That will ensure they repeal Obamacare... ...Jake, Jake, Jake, I just want to address that issue because you said I didn't answer, and I did.
0.13 I said, to me, I think the real focus shouldn't be -- you know, Hillary Clinton talks about the minimum wage.
0.15 That's her answer to grow the economy.
0.14 The answer is to give people the skills and the education so they make far more than minimum wage.
0.08 I don't want to argue about how low things are going to be, I want to talk about how do we lift everyone up in America.
0.20 That's what Reagan talked about.
0.15 It wasn't how bad things were, it was how to make it better for everyone.
0.29 That's what we've done in Wisconsin, that's exactly what we'd do as...: That's because of Barack -- that's because of Barack Obama.
0.28 : That's because of Barack Obama.
0.25 We've had a president who called ISIS the J.V.
0.23 squad, Yemen a success story, Iran a place we can do business with.
0.37 It's not because of George W. Bush; it's because of Barack Obama... (inaudible) on that point, though, whether it's -- whether we're talking about national security, foreign policy or we're talking about domestic policy, the key... ... the key issue here is talking about leadership.
0.26 Now, there's a lot of greater people up here, and you've heard a lot of great ideas out there.
0.17 But I would ask the American people, look at who's been tested.
0.57 When there were 100,000 protesters in my capital, I didn't back down, when they issued death threats against me and threats against my family, I didn't back down, when they tried to recall me, I didn't back down, and when they made me the -- one of their number-one targets last year, I didn't back down.
0.09 Give me the chance to be your president.
0.12 I won't back down... ... on any of these issues.
0.23 To be clear, what I said the other day was that we need to lift the political restrictions that are already in play.
0.46 Barack Obama's administration has put political restrictions on the military personnel already in Iraq.
0.16 We need to lift those and then we need to listen to our military experts, not the political forces in the White House, but our military experts about how many more we sent in.
0.10 And we certainly shouldn't have a commander-in-chief who sends a message to our adversaries as to how far we're going to go, and how far we're willing to fight, so I'm not putting a troop number.
0.30 What I'm saying is lift the political restrictions.
0.22 When you do that, you empower our military personnel already there to work with the Kurd and the Sunni allies, to reclaim the territory taken by ISIS.
0.28 And to do so in a way that allows that ISIS doesn't go back in Syria, as we were just talking about here.
0.18 That is the fundamental problem going forward.
0.32 We have a president -- and Hillary Clinton was a part of this, by the way, who has made political decisions for our men and women in uniform.
0.18 I want the men and women at home to know, if I'm commander-in-chief, I will only send you into harm's way when our national security is at risk.
0.25 And if we do, you know you'll have our full support, the support of the American people, and you'll have a clear path for victory.... a lot of those people, though, and I'm going to echo what Senator Rubio just said.
0.46 This is an issue where, we're talking about my state, it's thousands of manufacturing jobs.
0.48 Thousands of manufacturing jobs for a rule the Obama administration, own EPA has said will have a marginal impact on climate change.
0.70 So we're going to put thousands and thousands of jobs in my state, I think it's something like 30,000 in Ohio, other states across this country, we're going to put people -- manufacturing jobs, the kind of jobs that are far greater than minimum wage, this administration is willing to put at risk for something its own EPA says is marginal (ph)... Harley.
0.18 I love riding Harley's.
0.48 Well, I turned 13 years old two days before Ronald Reagan was first elected.
0.32 A lot of people forget this, but just a few days before that election 1980, he was behind in the polls.
0.17 And I think what changed things was people in America realized they didn't want to hear what was bad about America, they wanted to know how it was going to be better.
0.47 Ronald Reagan wasn't just a conservative Republican, he was an eternal optimist in the American people.
0.13 And I am too.
0.02 So here's what I think will make America better.
0.28 We need to live in a world where our children are free, are free from the threats of radical Islamic terrorism.
0.10 We need to live in an America where we have an economy, where everyone can live their piece of the American dream, no matter what that dream is.
0.11 And we need to live in an America where we have a federal government that is not too big to fail, but ultimately small enough to succeed, where we send powers back to the states and back to the people.
0.21 That's what I did in Wisconsin.
0.46 We took on the big government union bosses, the big government special interests, many of whom came in from Washington, to spend millions of dollars to try and take me out because we stood up to them, we didn't back down in any of those instances.
0.09 If you give me the chance as your next president, I won't back down any day, anyway, anyhow.
0.22 I'll fight and win for you and your families every single day I'm in office.
0.18 Good evening.
0.25 My story, from secretary to CEO, is only possible in this nation, and proves that everyone of us has potential.
0.43 My husband, Frank, of 30 years, started out driving a tow truck for a family owned auto body shop.
0.26 We have come to a pivotal point in our nation's history where this nation's possibilities and potential are being crushed by a government grown so big, so powerful, so inept, so corrupt, and a political class that refuses to do anything about it.
0.21 I am prepared to lead the resurgence of this great nation.
0.13 You know, I think Mr. Trump is a wonderful entertainer.
0.27 He's been terrific at that business.
0.52 I also think that one of the benefits of a presidential campaign is the character and capability, judgment and temperament of every single one of us is revealed over time and under pressure.
0.22 All of us will be revealed over time and under pressure.
0.17 I look forward to a long race.
0.17 That's not for me to answer; it is for the voters of this country to answer, and I have a lot of faith in the common sense and good judgment of the voters of the United States of America.
0.19 Jake, I'll tell you -- I'll tell you why people are supporting outsiders.
0.14 It's because you know what happens if someone's been in the system their whole life, they don't know how broken the system is.
0.19 A fish swims in water, it doesn't know it's water.
0.32 It's not that politicians are bad people, it's that they've been in that system forever.
0.73 The truth is 75 percent of the American people think the government is corrupt; 82 percent of the American people think these problems that have festered for 50 years in some cases, 25 years in other cases.
0.61 The border's been insecure for 25 years; 307,000 veterans have died waiting for health care.
0.16 These things have gone on for so long because no one will challenge the status quo.
0.20 You know what a leader does?
0.23 They challenge the status quo, they solve problems that have festered for a long time and they produce results.
0.16 That is what my whole life has been about.
0.26 People know this is about far more than replacing a D with an R --Having... Having met Vladimir Putin, if I may... Having met Vladimir Putin, I wouldn't talk to him at all.
0.15 We've talked way too much to him.
0.39 What I would do, immediately, is begin rebuilding the Sixth Fleet, I would begin rebuilding the missile defense program in Poland, I would conduct regular, aggressive military exercises in the Baltic states.
0.31 I'd probably send a few thousand more troops into Germany.
0.19 Vladimir Putin would get the message.
0.57 By the way, the reason it is so critically important that every one of us know General Suleimani's name is because Russia is in Syria right now, because the head of the Quds force traveled to Russia and talked Vladimir Putin into aligning themselves with Iran and Syria to prop up Bashar al- Assad.
0.15 Russia is a bad actor, but Vladimir Putin is someone we should not talk to, because the only way he will stop is to sense strength and resolve on the other side, and we have all of that within our control.
0.21 We could rebuild the Sixth Fleet.
0.12 I will.
0.25 We haven't.
0.29 We could rebuild the missile defense program.
0.25 We haven't.
0.12 I will.
0.30 We could also, to Senator Rubio's point, give the Egyptians what they've asked for, which is intelligence.
0.23 We could give the Jordanians what they've asked for... ...bombs and materiel.
0.24 We have not supplied it...
0.12 ...I will.
0.31 We could arm the Kurds.
0.35 They've been asking us for three years.
0.23 All of this is within our control....Jake... ...Jake, (INAUDIBLE)... And then it'll be my turn.
0.25 Dana, I'd like to... Dana, I would like to link these two issues, both of which are incredibly important, Iran and Planned Parenthood.
0.22 One has something to do with the defense of the security of this nation.
0.19 The other has something to do with the defense of the character of this nation.
0.27 You have not heard a plan about Iran from any politician up here, here is my plan.
0.42 On day one in the Oval Office, I will make two phone calls, the first to my good friend to Bibi Netanyahu to reassure him we will stand with the state of Israel.
0.28 The second, to the supreme leader, to tell him that unless and until he opens every military and every nuclear facility to real anytime, anywhere inspections by our people, not his, we, the United States of America, will make it as difficult as possible and move money around the global financial system.
0.13 We can do that, we don't need anyone's cooperation to do it.
0.17 And every ally and every adversary we have in this world will know that the United States in America is back in the leadership business, which is how we must stand with our allies.
0.24 This is about the character of our nation, and if we will not stand up in and force President Obama to veto this bill, shame on us.
0.30 You know, it's interesting to me, Mr. Trump said that he heard Mr. Bush very clearly and what Mr. Bush said.
0.25 I think women all over this country heard very clearly what Mr. Trump said.
0.55 Dana, with all being said to Mr. Trump... Immigration did not come up in 2016 because Mr. Trump brought it up.
0.43 We talked about it in 2012, we talked about it in 2008.
0.47 We talked about it in 2004.We have been talking about it for 25 years.
0.19 This is why people are tired of politicians.
0.19 First let me say, We have just spent a good bit of time discussing, as Republicans, how to solve this problem.
0.16 I would ask your audience at home to ask a very basic question.
0.54 Why have Democrats not solved this problem?President Obama campaigned in 2007 and 2008 on solving the immigration problem.
0.21 He entered Washington with majorities in the House and the Senate.
0.14 He could have chosen to do anything to solve this pro -- this problem.
0.20 Instead, he chose to do nothing.
0.19 Why?
0.14 because the Democrats don't want this issue solved.
0.33 And meanwhile, what will continue to go on is what has gone on for 25 years.
0.50 With all due respect, Mr. Trump, we've been talking about illegal immigration for 25 years.
0.47 San Francisco has been a sanctuary city since 1989.
0.39 There are 300 of them.
0.31 And meanwhile, what has happened?
0.15 Nothing.
0.39 The border remains insecure.
0.28 The legal immigration system remains broken.
0.16 Look, we know what it takes to secure a border.
0.20 We've heard a lot of great ideas here.
0.15 Money, manpower, technology... ...mostly, apparently, leadership... ...the kind of leadership that understands how to get results.
0.13 But you -- you would stipulate, Mr. Trump, but not everyone agrees with you.
0.50 I led Hewlett Packard through a very difficult time, the worst technology recession in 25 years.
0.53 The NASDAQ stock index fell 80 percent.
0.39 It took 15 years for the stock index to recover.
0.45 We had very strong competitors who literally went out of business and lost all of their jobs in the process.
0.16 We must lead in this nation again, and some tough calls are going to be required.
0.28 But as for the firing, I have been very honest about this from the day it happened.
0.20 When you challenge the status quo, you make enemies.
0.19 I made a few.
0.35 Steve Jobs told me that when he called me the day I was fired to say, hey, been there, done that twice.
0.46 It's also true that the man that led my firing, Tom Perkins, just took ---- out a full-page ad in the New York Times to say he was wrong, I was right.
0.25 I was a terrific CEO, the board was dysfunctional.
0.21 And he thinks I will make a magnificent president of the United States.
0.24 You know, Jeffrey Sonnenfeld is a well-known Clintonite and honestly had it out for me from the moment that I arrived at Hewlett Packard.
0.11 But honestly, Mr. Trump, I find it quite rich that you would talk about this.
0.34 You know, there are a lot of us Americans who believe that we are going to have trouble someday paying back the interest on our debt because politicians have run up mountains of debt using other people's money.
0.24 That is in fact precisely the way you ran your casinos.
0.60 You ran up mountains of debt, as well as losses, using other people's money, and you were forced to file for bankruptcy not once ---- not twice, four times, a record four times.
0.31 Why should we trust you to manage the finances ---- of this nation any differently than you managed the finances --A track record of leadership is not a game.
0.22 It is the issue in this election.
0.35 Well, I thought we had been hearing quite a bit about Govenor Christie's record as governor, actually.
0.18 I think track records are very important.
0.14 I completely agree that what's at stake here is the future of this nation, and the future of every American.
0.17 But I do think that a track record of leadership is vital because in the end this election is about leadership.
0.12 And let's talk about what leadership is.
0.30 It's not about braggadocio, it is about challenging the status quo, solving problems, producing results.
0.31 And the highest calling of leadership is to unlock potential in others.
0.23 Problems have festered in Washington for too long.
0.24 And the potential of this nation is being crushed.
0.22 You see, Governor Christie, people spend time talking about their track records, and Mr. Trump and I have every right to do the same.
0.29 And Mrs. Clinton has to defend her track record.
0.26 Her track record of lying about Benghazi, of lying about her e- mails, about lying about her servers.
0.28 She does not have a track record of accomplishment.
0.44 Like Mrs. Clinton, I, too, have travels hundreds of thousands of miles around the globe.
0.25 But unlike Mrs. Clinton, I know flying is an activity, not an accomplishment.
0.31 Mrs. Clinton -- if you want to stump a Democrat, ask them to name a accomplishment of Mrs. Clinton's.
0.59 We just spent -- we just spent the last 10 minutes... ...we need to reform the Department of Defense, we need as well... ...to invest in our military technology, and we need to care for our veterans so 307,000... ...aren't dying waiting for health care.
0.12 Jake, may I just say... Jake -- Jake...
0.09 I very much hope I am the only person on this stage who can say this, but I know there are millions of Americans out there who will say the same thing.
0.32 My husband Frank and I buried a child to drug addiction.
0.13 So, we must invest more in the treatment of drugs.
0.17 I agree with Senator Paul.
0.22 I agree with states' rights.
0.28 But we are misleading young people when we tell them that marijuana is just like having a beer.
0.21 It's not.
0.57 And the marijuana that kids are smoking today is not the same as the marijuana that Jeb Bush smoked 40 years ago.
0.26 We do -- sorry, Barbara.
0.22 We do need -- we do need criminal justice reform.
0.49 We have the highest incarceration rates in the world.
0.35 Two-thirds of the people in our prisons are there for non-violent offenses, mostly drug related.
0.16 It's clearly not working.
0.16 But we need to tell young people the truth.
0.25 Drug addiction is an epidemic, and it is taking too many of our young people.
0.13 I know this sadly from personal experience.
0.55 I wouldn't change the $10 bill, or the $20 bill.
0.13 I think, honestly, it's a gesture.
0.18 I don't think it helps to change our history.
0.13 What I would think is that we ought to recognize that women are not a special interest group.
0.36 Women are the majority of this nation.
0.23 We are half the potential of this nation, and this nation will be better off when every woman has the opportunity to live the life she chooses.
0.15 I think what this nation can be and must be is symbolized by Lady Liberty and Lady Justice.
0.21 Lady Liberty stands tall and strong.
0.15 She is clear-eyed and resolute.
0.14 She doesn't shield her eyes from the realities of the world, but she faces outward into the world nevertheless, as we always must.
0.12 And she holds her torch high, because she knows she is a beacon of hope in a very troubled world.
0.27 And Lady Justice, Lady Justice holds a sword by her side, because she is a fighter, a warrior for the values and the principles that have made this nation great.
0.16 She holds a scale in her other hand.
0.25 And with that scale she says all of us are equal in the eyes of God.
0.19 And so all of us must be equal in the eyes of the law and the government, powerful and powerless alike.
0.15 And she wears a blindfold.
0.14 And with that blindfold she is saying to us that it must be true, it can be true that in this country, in this century, it doesn't matter who you are, it doesn't matter what you look like, it doesn't matter how you start, it doesn't matter your circumstances, here in this nation, every American's life must be filled with the possibilities that come from their God-given gifts.
0.32 One nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
0.21 Hello, I'm John Kasich, the Governor of Ohio.
0.19 Emma, and Reese, my children, and Karen, love 'ya girls.
0.16 Thanks for watching tonight.
0.23 By the way, I think I actually flew on this plane with Ronald Reagan when I was a congressman, and his goals, and mine, really much -- are pretty much the same.
0.16 Lift Americans, unify, give hope, grow America, and restore it is to that great, shining city on a hill.
0.33 Yes, he was a great one, and I learned much from watching him.
0.20 The most important thing, hope to Americans, unify, lift everyone in America.
0.11 Listen, you know, I -- if I were sitting at home and watch thing back and forth, I would be inclined to turn it off.
0.07 I mean, people at home want to know across this country, they want to know what we're going to do to fix this place, how we'll balance a budget, how we're going to create more economic growth, how we'll pay down the debt.
0.24 What we're going to do to strengthen the military.
0.25 So, we just spent 10 minutes here...
0.19 But -- but wait a minute.
0.25 It's a lot of ad hogshead.
0.03 Now, I know that it may be buzzing out there, but I think it's important we get to the issues, because that's what people want, and they don't want all this fighting....Yeah, well... Well, let me just say this.
0.29 First of all, I think it's a bad agreement, I would never have done it.
0.22 But, you know, a lot of our problems in the world today is that we don't have the relationship with our allies.
0.23 If we want to go everywhere alone, we will not have the strength as (ph) if we could rebuild with our allies.
0.31 Now, this agreement, we don't know what's going to happen in 18 months.
0.36 I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years.
0.29 I've seen lots of issues in foreign affairs, and foreign -- in terms of global politics, you have to be steady.
0.24 Now, here's the -- if they cheat, we slap the sanctions back on.
0.33 If they help Hamas, and Hezbollah, we slap the sanctions back on.
0.30 And, if we find out that they may be developing a nuclear weapon, than the military option is on the table.
0.18 We are stronger when we work with the Western civilization, our friends in Europe, and just doing it on our own I don't think is the right policy.
0.19 No, no, no.
0.07 I want to -- I want to -- I want to say something about what the senator just said.
0.07 No one is -- no -- let me -- let me suggest to you we believe that we operate better in the world when our allies work with us.
0.39 President Bush did it in the Gulf War.
0.19 We work better when we are unified.
0.23 Secondly, nobody's trusting Iran.
0.22 They violate the deal, we put on the sanctions, and we have the high moral ground to talk to our allies in Europe to get them to go with us.
0.28 If they don't go with us, we slap the sanctions on anyway.
0.38 If they fund these radical groups that threaten Israel and all of the West, then we should rip up the deal and put the sanctions back on.
0.09 And let me make it clear -- let me make it clear... ... if we think -- if we think they're getting close to a -- to developing a nuclear weapon and we get that information, you better believe that I would do everything in my power as the commander-in-chief to stop them having a nuclear weapon.
0.15 We can have it, and we can have our allies, and we can be strong as a country, and we can project across this globe with unity, not just doing it alone.
0.10 That is not what gets us where we want to get as a nation.
0.23 Well, I agree that we should defund Planned Parenthood.
0.20 I don't know many people in America who don't think that we should, and in my state, we're trying to figure out how to get it done, because we are threatened with the federal government taking all of our Medicaid money away.
0.29 I think there is a way to get this done by giving governors the ability to be able to act to defund Planned Parenthood.
0.25 But when (ph) it comes to closing down the federal government, you gotta be very careful about that.
0.26 When we shut the government down -- if we have a chance at success and it's a great principle, yes.
0.25 The president of the United States is not going to sign this, and all we're gonna do is shut the government down, and then we're gonna open up -- open it up, and the American people are gonna shake their heads and say, "what's the story with these Republicans?
0.17 "So I think there is a way to get to cutting off the funding for Planned Parenthood.
0.63 I was in the Congress for 18 years, balanced the budget, cut taxes, got it done.
0.42 Changed welfare, went around the president to get welfare reform done.
0.23 There are ways to do it without having to shut the government down, but I'm sympathetic to the fact that we don't want this organization to get funding, and the money ought to be reprogrammed for family planning in other organizations that don't support this tactic.
0.11 But I would not be for shutting the government down... ...because I don't think it's going to work out....Dana, in a way that maximizes their value for sale for profit.
0.12 It is disgusting, and the American people need to hear it... ...we shouldn't be fighting with each other.
0.16 She's the real opponent, she's the real problem.
0.15 I'll tell you what -- I'll tell you what I'd be willing to fight for.
0.21 I'll tell you what I'd be willing to fight for.
0.30 Why will (ph) we put tax reform on the president's desk, so we can simplify this tax system?No, no, it's really important, Dana.
0.19 We got to talk about what we would be willing to shut down for.
0.19 Why don't we put tax reform on this president's desk, and make him veto it if that's what he wants to do?
0.30 Why haven't we repealed and replaced Obamacare?Make him veto if that's what he wants to do.
0.16 I don't at this point in terms of changing the incentives for investment and risk-taking.
0.22 But let's just stop for a second.
0.36 There's one person on this stage that does have a record.
0.51 I'm the only person on the stage and one of the few people in this country that led the effort as the chief architect of the last time we balanced the federal budget.
0.43 We also cut taxes.
0.57 And when I left Washington in 2000, we had a $5 trillion surplus, and the economy was booming.
0.62 I had spent 10 years of my life to get us to that point, went out in the private sector, was a great experience, and went into Ohio and took an $8 billion hole and turned it into a $2 billion surplus.
0.56 We've had the largest amount of tax cuts of any sitting governor.
0.56 We've grown well over 300,000 jobs.
0.25 You see, I've done it in both places.
0.35 I'm the only one here that has done it in both places.
0.29 It took a lot to get us to a balanced budget.
0.23 It was legitimate.
0.18 It was real.
0.32 And we negotiated it.
0.16 A lot of what we're talking about here tonight as we take this position and that position, you know what?
0.14 At the end of the day, America has got to work.
0.18 We've got to figure out how we come together to deal with this -- with our fiscal problems because when we deal with that, we create a stronger economy for everybody.
0.21 People have a chance to rise.
0.12 So, you know, when we think about how we make a choice, it's the person that lands that plane.
0.23 It's not somebody that talks about it.
0.22 It's about the person who has done it.
0.29 And I've done it in... ... both places.
0.30 And I did it including people in the other party.
0.16 And that's how we were successful.
0.13 And that's how I will be president, using that experience to drive this country forward.
0.14 Thank you.
0.20 Well, look, people still have to get to know me, so I want to spend my time talking about my experience reforming welfare, balancing budgets, cutting taxes, providing economic growth when I was in Washington, turning Ohio around.
0.76 Eight billion in the hole, $2 billion surplus, up over 300,000 jobs, big tax cuts, strengthening our credit.
0.31 All those things matter but, you know, as a young man in my first election in 1978, I defeated an incumbent Democrat.
0.45 I defeated an incumbent Democrat in 1982; running on the Reagan program, I was the only Republican in America to defeat an incumbent Democrat that year.
0.49 And then, when I won for election of governor, I was the first Republican to defeat an incumbent in 36 years, and the first person to have never run statewide out of politics for 10 years to beat an incumbent.
0.42 That hadn't happened for 96 years.
0.19 So, we'll get to the point where we'll talk about Hillary Clinton, or whoever the nominee is, record.
0.13 But right now, I want to give people sense of hope, sense of purpose, a sense of unity, sense that we can do it.
0.19 So... You know, at the end of the day, I'm going to continue to talk about my record, because there is, did you ever notice when people run for office, they run for president, they make a lot of promises, they don't keep them.
0.36 Can I just -- can I -- Jake, can I just make one point on this whole military discussion?I called for boots on the ground many months ago in a coalition with our friends who share our interest.
0.11 You know, you win a battle with the military, and when we go somewhere, we need to be mobile, and lethal.
0.19 We need to take care of business, and we need to come home.
0.24 But, we face, also, a bigger war -- and you win the bigger war with the battle of ideas.
0.28 You wonder why young people, and educated people, rich people, schooled people, have tried to join ISIS.Western civilization, all of us, need to wake up to the fact that those murderers and rapists need to be called out, and in Western civilization we need to make it clear that our faith in the Jewish and Christian principals force us to live a life bigger than ourselves... ...to make (ph) centers (ph) of justice so that we can battle the radicals, call them out for what they are, and make sure that all of our people feel fulfilled in living in Western civilization...
0.14 ...This is a giant battle in the world today... Well, it's probably not, maybe, legal, but, I would pick Mother Theresa, the lady that I had a chance to meet, a woman who lived a life so much bigger than her own.
0.15 An inspiration to everyone when we think about our responsibility to love our neighbor as we love ourselves.
0.44 Well, I have one now -- they (ph) call me, "Unit One".My wife says, "You'll never be Unite One, I'm Unite One.
0.23 You're Unit Two."
0.22 FIORINA: Secretariat.
0.12 Well, as president, I will make this a nation that will solve problems.
0.08 And how?
0.28 By having the elected officials and the leaders realize they're Americans before they're Republicans or Democrats.
0.23 I did it in Washington.
0.26 And I've done it in Ohio by having the elected officials realize that they're Ohioans before anything else.
0.20 Secondly, I will rebuild the relationships and show the respect to our allies around the world.
0.22 We have no choice but to do that.
0.24 We will be stronger when we are unified.
0.19 And we'll fight for freedom and for human rights.
0.29 And finally, a little bit of what Carly said.
0.34 The people that are out there listening, America was never great because we ran America from the top down.
0.27 America is great because we have run America from the bottom up, where we all live in the neighborhoods.
0.18 One more time in America, we need to revive the concept of citizenship, where everybody's actions make a huge difference in changing the world.
0.24 We have a Holocaust memorial on our state house grounds.
0.21 And there is one line on there that stands out all the time.
0.27 "If you've saved one life, you've changed the world.
0.15 "We need to adopt that as citizens and rebuild and reinspire our country.
0.14 Thank you.
0.15 Hi, my name is Chris Christie, and I'd like to you take the camera off me and put it on the audience because I'd like to ask all of you, how many of you, raise your hand, believe that in today's Barak Obama America your children will have a better life than you've had?You see?
0.29 That's why I'm running for President.
0.14 because leadership is not about me, it's about our country.
0.22 And, what we talk about tonight, it's not about us, it's about the people in the audience tonight, because in seven short years this president has stripped away their trust, and their faith, and their belief that the next generation will have a better life.
0.21 He's stolen that from us, and when I'm president, I'm going to take it back.
0.27 Well, I know Ben wasn't talking about me, I'm sure he was talking about one of the other guys, not me.
0.29 As far as being an outsider is concerned -- as far as being an outsider is concerned, let me tell you this, Jake, I'm a Republican in New Jersey.
0.29 I wake up every morning as an outsider.
0.26 I wake up every morning with a Democratic legislature who trying to beat my head in and fight me because I'm trying to bring conservative change to a state that needed it desperately.
0.10 And so, everyone can talk us here about their credentials.
0.55 But the bottom line is, every morning I get up, I veto 400 bills from a crazy liberal Democratic legislature, not one of them has been overridden.
0.66 I've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history, according to Americans for Tax Reform.
0.18 What folks want in this country is somebody to go down there and get the job done.
0.25 And that's exactly what I'll do.
0.13 So, I know this much, that what the American people want to hire right now is somebody who believes in them.
0.21 And believes that they are the ones who can fix our country.
0.11 I will be the vessel through which they can fix this country, but it's not about me.
0.20 It's about all of you.
0.13 And getting this government off your back and out of your way, and letting you succeed.
0.23 I know Ben wasn't talking about me.
0.27 She is, and so if she, based on conscience, can't sign that -- that marriage license, then there should be someone in her office to be able to do it, and if the law needs to be changed in the state of Kentucky, which is what she's advocating, it should be changed.
0.35 And why don't we do the same thing with Planned Parenthood?We elected a Republican Congress to do this.
0.21 And they should be doing it, and they're not.
0.35 And they're giving the president a pass.
0.28 I put it in the list, Dana.
0.18 We should be doing these things and forcing the president to take action.
0.21 Let's force him to do what he says he's going to do.
0.09 Now I don't know whether he'll do it or not, but let's force him to do it.
0.15 First of, Jake, I don't yield to anybody on how to enforce the law.
0.28 I'm the only person on this stage who spent seven years as a United States Attorney after September 11th, and I know how to do this.
0.69 The fact is though that for 15,000 people a day to be deported every day for two years is an undertaking that almost none of us could accomplish given the current levels of funding, and the current number of law enforcement officers.
0.07 Here's what we need to do, and I think this is where Donald is absolutely right.
0.19 What we need to do is to secure our border, and we need to do it with more than just a wall.
0.16 We need to use electronics, we need to use drones, we need to use FBI, DEA, and ATF, and yes, we need to take the fingerprint of every person who comes into this country on a visa, and when they overstay their visa, we need to tap them on the shoulder, and say, "You have overstayed your welcome, you're taking advantage of the American people.
0.13 It's time for you to go.
0.50 "If we had that kind of system in place, we wouldn't have the 11 million people we have now.
0.22 Jake listen.
0.29 While I'm as entertained as anyone by this personal back-and-forth about the history of Donald and Carly's career, for the 55-year-old construction worker out in that audience tonight who doesn't have a job, who can't fund his child's education, I've got to tell you the truth.
0.25 They could care less about your careers, they care about theirs.
0.15 Let's start talking about that on this stage and stop playing -- and stop playing the games.
0.23 Stop playing --John -- I'm not done yet, John.
0.14 Stop -- and stop playing -- and Carly -- Carly, listen.
0.14 You can interrupt everybody else on this stage, you're not going to interrupt me, OK?The fact is that we don't want to hear about your careers, back and forth and volleying back and forth about who did well and who did poorly.
0.24 You're both successful people.
0.15 Congratulations.
0.12 You know who's not successful?
0.44 The middle class in this country who's getting plowed over by Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.
0.15 Let's start talking about those issues tonight and stop this childish back-and-forth between the two of you.
0.20 Listen, you know, Hugh, it's an important point.
0.32 And the question is, who is going to prosecute Hillary Clinton?The Obama White House seems to have in interest, the Justice Department seems to have no interest.
0.19 I think it's time to put a former federal prosecutor on the same stage as Hillary Clinton.
0.17 And I will prosecute her during those debates on that stage for the record we're talking about here.
0.53 The fact she had a private email server in her basement, using national security secrets running through it, could have been hacked by the Russians, the Chinese, or two 18-year-olds on a toot (ph) wanting to have some fun.
0.21 No one is answering that question from the Hillary Clinton campaign... You know why?
0.09 Because she knows she's wrong, and she cannot look in the mirror at herself, and she cannot tell the American people the truth.
0.50 Well, Jake, I was named U.S. attorney by President Bush on September 10th, 2001.
0.37 And that next day my wife Mary Pat did what she did every day, she traveled through the World Trade Center and went to her office two blocks from the World Trade Center.
0.64 And after those planes hit, for five-and-a-half-hours after that, I couldn't reach her, didn't know whether she was dead or alive, and we had three children at the time, 8, 5 and 1.And I had to confront what so many thousands of others in my region had to confront, the idea I might become a single parent, the idea that my life and my children's life might be changed forever.
0.21 We lost friends that day.
0.45 We went to the funerals.
0.24 And I will tell you that what those people wanted and what they deserved was for America to answer back against what had been done to them.
0.27 And I support what President Bush did at that time, going into Afghanistan, hunting al Qaeda and its leaders, getting its sanctuary out of place, and making it as difficult around the world for them to move people and money.
0.31 And then he went to prosecutors like us, and he said, never again.
0.20 Don't prosecute these people after the crime is committed.
0.26 Intervene before the crime happens.
0.16 I absolutely believe that what the president did at the time was right.
0.30 And I am proud to have been one of the people on the stage who was part of making sure that what Governor Bush said before was the truth.
0.43 America was safe for those seven years and Barack Obama has taken that safety away from us.
0.32 Let me say this, Jake, is that while that may have been a fine idea that Dr. Carson had, these people were out to kill us.
0.40 I stood in that region with my family, and every time a plane went overhead in the weeks after that, people's heads jerked to the sky because they thought it was happening again.
0.17 You do not need to go through subtle diplomacy at that point.
0.16 That could be handled later on.
0.14 What you need is a strong American leader who will take the steps that are necessary to protect our nation.
0.14 That's what I would do as commander-in-chief in this circumstance.
0.38 And that's what President George W. Bush did in 2001.You know, I enjoy the interplay.
0.18 Thank you, gentlemen.
0.38 I'll just say this, first off, New Jersey is the first state in the nation that now says if you are non-violent, non-dealing drug user, that you don't go to jail for your first offense.
0.15 You go to mandatory treatment.
0.13 You see, Jake, I'm pro-life.
0.08 And I think you need to be pro-life for more than just the time in the womb.
0.16 It gets tougher when they get out of the womb.
0.23 And when they're the 16-year-old drug addict in the Florida county lockup, that life is just as precious as the life in the womb.
0.15 And so, that's why I'm for rehabilitation, why I think the war on drugs has been a failure.
0.19 But I'll end with this.
0.23 That doesn't mean we should be legalizing gate way drugs.
0.43 And if Senator Paul thinks that the only victim is the person, look at the decrease in productivity, look at the way people get used and move on to other drugs when they use marijuana as a gateway drug, it is not them that are the only victims.
0.32 Their families are the victims too, their children are the victims too, and their employers are the victims also.
0.34 That's why I'll enforce the federal law, while you can still put an emphasis on rehabilitation, which we've done in New Jersey.
0.22 And Senator Paul knows that that's simply not the truth.
0.47 In New Jersey, we have medical marijuana laws, which I supported and implemented.
0.26 This is not medical marijuana.
0.16 There's goes as much -- a further step beyond.
0.34 This is recreational use of marijuana.
0.23 If he wants to change the federal law, get Congress to pass the law to change it, and get a president to sign it.
0.20 No, it's not.
0.21 But with Donald, it's a good start.
0.22 That's really good.
0.21 No, listen.
0.43 This is an issue that -- that we've gotta talk about, and we haven't talked about yet.71 percent of all federal spending is on entitlements and debt service.
0.56 When John Kennedy was elected president in 1960, it was 26 percent.
0.39 Harvard and Dartmouth says that Social Security's going to go insolvent in seven to eight years.
0.10 So what I say is very simple.
0.14 We need to save this program for the good people out there who have paid into the system and need it.
0.11 And if that means making sure that folks like Donald and many of us on the stage don't get it, that's the right thing to do because here's what Hillary Clinton is going to want to do.
0.19 She's going to want to put more money into a system that has already lied to us and stolen from us.
0.23 This government doesn't need more money to make Social Security solvent.
0.15 We need to be not paying out benefits to people who don't really need it.
0.18 We need to protect the people who Social Security means the difference between picking between heat and rent and food.
0.23 That's why I put out the proposal and that's the people I'm trying to...
0.10 I don't think Senator Rubio is a skeptic of climate change.
0.09 I think what Senator Rubio said I agree with.
0.16 That in fact we don't need this massive government intervention to deal with the problem.
0.26 Look at what we have done in New Jersey.
0.41 We have already reached our clean air goals for 2020.
0.42 And when I was governor, I pulled out of the regional cap and trade deal, the only state in the Northeast that did that.
0.40 And we still reached our goals.
0.19 Why?
0.45 Because 53 percent of our electricity comes from nuclear.
0.34 We use natural gas.
0.30 We use solar power.
0.52 We're the third-highest- using solar power state.
0.14 You know why?
0.20 Because we made all of those things economically feasible.
0.16 I agree with Marco.
0.30 We shouldn't be destroying our economy in order to chase some wild left-wing idea that somehow us by ourselves is going to fix the climate.
0.13 We can contribute to that and be economically sound.
0.28 We have proven we can do that in New Jersey.
0.13 Nuclear needs to be back on the table in a significant way in this country if we want to go after this problem.
0.25 I understand.
0.32 No, no, listen, everybody makes a mistake every once in a while, Jake, even George Shultz.
0.26 And if that's truly a representation of what he believes we should be doing, then with all due respect to the former secretary of state, I disagree with him.
0.19 I think the Adams family has been shorted in the currency business.
0.28 Our country wouldn't be here without John Adams, and he would not have been able to do it without Abigal Adams, so, I'd put Abigail Adams on the bill.
0.55 You know, I've been called a lot of names by a lot of different people, and now I got to get called by names by the Secret Service?I turned 18 in 1980, and my first vote was for Ronald Reagan.
0.12 Boy, am I glad I did it.
0.11 And I think the country is, too.
0.11 A Christie presidency won't be about me.
0.11 It will be about you.
0.26 Tonight, you sit at home in your living room, frustrated that you play by the rules, you pay the taxes, you do the hard things to raise your family, yet you feel like America's generosity is being taken advantage of.
0.32 That you've been -- system is being gamed, and that you're turning out to fall further and further behind.
0.28 Our presidency -- our presidency -- will be about ending that, about enforcing the law, level the playing field for everybody, and once again reward those folks who play by the rules, and think that justice means more than just the word.
0.08 But it means a way of life.
0.16 And I will tell you this, around the world, I will not shake hands with, I will not meet with, and I will not agree to anything with a country that says death to us and death to Israel and holds our hostages while we sign agreements with them.
0.13 It will be an America that be strong and resolute, and will once again be able to stick out its chest and say, "we truly are the greatest nation in the world, because we live our lives that way, each and every day.
0.20 "John, I think the reason voters are so frustrated is nothing seems to change in DC.Look, over the next the several hours, youre going to hear several Republicans, all tell you they want to shrink the size of government and grow the American economy.
0.19 And it sounds great.
0.16 Weve got to do it.
0.46 Heres the truth, of all these folks talking, Im the only one that has cut the size of government.
0.30 Theres not two of us; theres one of us.
0.26 The rest of it is all just hot air.
0.09 When politicians talk, we need to pay attention to what they do, not what they say.
0.53 Im the only one thats reduced the size of government.
0.28 Lets shrink the government economy, lets grow the American economy.
0.16 I think thats a false choice.
0.13 I think this was a very bad deal.
0.29 Whenever they tell us in D.C. theyre going to cut tomorrow, that means theyre never going to cut.
0.21 Tomorrow never seems to happen.
0.20 Instead, why wont we actually follow our conservative principles.
0.21 Why not insist on structural reforms.
0.32 Why not cut spending.
0.28 I dont mean shrink the growth rate.
0.29 I mean actually spend less.
0.32 Why not a balanced budget in the amendment to the Constitution, why not a super majority vote before our taxes before they grow the government faster than the economy.
0.16 I think thats a false choice.
0.24 If I were leading, we would pass a conservative budget, challenge the President to do the right thing.
0.25 Heres the problem, the Republicans never want to fight.
0.16 Give Pelosi and Reid credit.
0.34 They forced Obamacare and socialism down our throats.
0.30 Why wont the Republicans fight half as hard for freedom and opportunity?
0.24 This was a bad budget.
0.19 Look, the left always complains theres not enough money for government.
0.60 We have 30,000 fewer state employees since the day I took office.
0.17 Eight credit upgrades.
0.48 Were a top ten state for private sector job creation.
0.22 Weve got a choice.
0.19 You grow the government economy or the American economy.
0.52 When I became governor, we had 25 years without ()migration.
0.25 We were coming back from Katrina.
0.19 The question many were asking, Will Louisiana rebuild?
0.50 Should Louisiana rebuild?Seven years in a row, more people moving into the state than leaving the state.
0.52 We now have more people working than ever before, earning a higher income than ever before.
0.53 Yes, we have reduced the size of government.
0.20 Thats exactly what we need to do in DC.
0.27 In DC, the Republicans slow the growth rate.
0.38 They claim victory.
0.19 Thats not enough.
0.25 Lets be honest with where we are today.
0.32 We are running off a cliff.
0.16 Well be the next Greece.
0.59 We can rearrange the chair, over $18 trillion of debt.
0.29 No wonder our economy has been stagnant.
0.31 We havent had real growth.
0.23 If youre a young student here, you have not seen a robust economy.
0.17 Well, John, a couple things.
0.71 Not only do we not raise taxes, we did the largest income tax cut in the states history.
0.25 And Im proud of that record.
0.11 I think thats the kind of leadership voters want in DC.Look, if you want a Republican thats going to grow government spending, if you want a candidate who is going to increase taxes, Im not your guy.
0.14 If you want somebody thats going to do and say the things that cant be said, cant be done, Im asking you to vote for me, to join my cause.
0.13 Thats how dangerous these times are.
0.17 These are dangerous times for America.
0.12 I think we have a chance to rescue the idea of America, but if we dont do it now, four years will be too late from now.
0.69 So, yes, Im proud we cut taxes, we cut spending, 30,000 fewer state government bureaucrats from the day I took office.
0.12 I absolutely will do that in DC.Absolutely, John, I would go further.
0.25 My tax plan, like everybodys, is like a lot of Republicans.
0.82 Look, Id get rid of the death penalty and the marriage penalty and Id simplify the brackets to 25 percent, 10 percent, 2 percent so that an average middle-class family a teacher married to law enforcementIm going to get to that pays 25 percent today would pay 10 percent under my plan.
0.37 But my plan does three things different from other peoples plans.
0.51 Remember, I said 2 percent.
0.09 I think everybody should pay something.
0.54 Even if its only 2 percent.
0.55 Thats the most important 2 percent of my plan.
0.14 I know a lot of Republicans brag you all can clap.
0.20 It doesnt scare me.
0.22 Go ahead.
0.18 I heard some people.
0.40 There are millions of folks that wouldnt pay taxes in Jebs plan and Trumps plan.
0.09 I think thats a mistake.
0.34 In terms of the corporate tax.
0.23 Secondly, I would get rid of the corporate tax.
0.52 We do have the highest corporate tax rate in the developed world.
0.14 I would get rid of it.
0.22 I would get rid of all the corporate welfare.
0.30 Make the CEOs pay their same tax rates the way the rest of us do.
0.21 And, third, I would purposely shrink the size of government.
0.19 You know, that is an intentional feature of my plan.
0.22 Weve got a choice.
0.21 Do we grow the government economy or the American economy?
0.25 So I say get rid of the corporate tax.
0.38 Bring those jobs and investments here to the United States, stop sending jobs and investment overseas.
0.08 Look, I think the government should work to change that.
0.27 That does not mean Im for the government mandating that.
0.21 We already have too many government mandates out of DC.
0.23 Do I want people to have paid leave?
0.16 Sure.
0.50 More people to earn higher wages?
0.16 Sure.
0.27 Do I want them to have better benefits?
0.16 Sure.
0.19 The government cant wave a magic wand and make that happen.
0.23 Heres the problem.
0.42 Over the past seven years, President Obama has tried to teach the American people the government is the answer to all of our problems.
0.23 Where has that gotten us?
0.44 We are on the path towards socialism.
0.34 The way that folks can get better-paying jobs with better benefits is we have a growing economy.
0.27 That means repeal all of Obamacare, a lower, flatter tax code.
0.27 That means we have an energy plan that makes sense.
0.18 That means we embrace an all of the above approach to energy.
0.27 Those are good-paying jobs.
0.77 The 50-, 70-, $90,000 paying jobs with benefits.
0.24 But this President wont let us produce more energy on our domestic federal lands and waters.
0.41 He wont allow the Canadians to build a Keystone pipeline.
0.35 Hes got an EPA thats doing everything they can to kill private sector jobs in America.
0.29 So, yes, I want families to have better-paying jobs and better benefits, but were not going to get that with a government mandate.
0.29 Were going to get that with a growing economy.
0.18 Well, a couple things.
0.31 Youre talking about payroll taxes that fund programs.
0.31 People pay for the medical care; they pay for their Social Security.
0.19 I want every American to worry and care about how those folks in DC are spending our money.
0.64 We have $18 trillion in debt.
0.35 They are misspending our money.
0.33 Earned success is so much more fulfilling than unearned success.
0.42 I dont want us to continue to create one class of Americans that pays income taxes, that pays for government, another class of Americans thats growing more and more dependent on government.
0.27 Thats what we have today.
0.28 Socialism is bad, not only for taxpayers, but for people that they say theyre trying to help.
0.17 There is dignity in work.
0.20 There is dignity in self-sufficiency.
0.13 I want to quote to you a president.
0.39 A previous president said this.
0.36 He said, The problem is, is that tax rates are too high.
0.30 Government income/revenues are too low.
0.42 He said, paradoxically, lowering tax rates now is the best way to produce higher government revenues later.
0.35 No, that wasnt President Reagan, as many are probably guessing at home.
0.25 That was President Kennedy.
0.13 I see you know the answer.
0.25 That was President Kennedy.
0.32 Imagine if he were alive today and if he was at that last Democratic debate.
0.32 Imagine if you try to say that in a party thats gearing towards socialism, that wouldnt be welcome in todays Democratic Party.
0.11 Well, thank you.
0.39 Look, if Senator Santorum wants to concede the tax cut wing of the Republican Party, Im happy to fight for that side of the Republican party.
0.29 Hes exactly right.
0.19 I explicitly want to shrink the size of government.
0.62 22 percent over ten years is not too much.
0.70 Weve cut our state budget 26 percent in 8 years.
0.17 This is a fundamental choice.
0.33 We mustnt become a cheaper version of the Democratic Party, a second liberal party.
0.31 We need to proudly say were willing to cut taxes, shrink government, grow the American economy.
0.41 President Kennedy said it to the Democratic Party, why cant we say it in the Republican Party in 2015.
0.35 Lets cut taxes.
0.33 John, our budget is balanced.
0.55 We balanced our budget every year for 8 years.
0.35 Yeah, we had to cut spending.
0.12 You know what?
0.48 We privatized or closed 9 of our 10 charity hospitals.
0.26 We did statewide school choice.
0.21 Youre quoting an old number from the beginning of the year.
0.27 We closed that gap.
0.25 What they talk about, just like DC, government is the only place where if you give them less money than they wanted, they count it as a cut.
0.35 They take last years budget, they add inflation, they call it a baseline.
0.17 We need to do zero-based budgeting.
0.26 We need to say just because you got money last year, you dont have it this year let me close, though.
0.42 We balanced our budget.
0.23 We didnt raise taxes.
0.47 In 8 years weve never raised taxes.
0.38 We cut taxes.
0.22 Our taxpayers, our families are the better off for it.
0.15 Well, two things.
0.17 Absolutely they should be accountable.
0.24 They should be accountable for their students through the market.
0.17 Look, you either trust the American people to make their own choices or you dont.
0.17 I know the Left thinks we need to be protected from ourselves.
0.43 President Obama is trying to limit competition in the higher-education market.
0.28 As a result, you are going to see tuition prices continue to go up.
0.46 Weve got a trillion dollars of student debt, and counting, and he wants to exempt certain schools from the same oversight he wants to apply only to the for-profit market.
0.24 For some reason, the private sector is a bad word to this President.
0.19 Its not in the real world.
0.28 In Louisiana, we fought so that the dollars follow the child, instead of the child following the dollar.
0.25 What that means from K through 12, what that means is that parents and their families can decide what is the best way for their children to be educated.
0.52 Higher education, we have a TOPS program, where again, we will help if a student maintains a 20 ACT, 2.5 GPA, well pay for their tuition.
0.28 They can take those dollars to a private school of their choice in the state as well.
0.19 You either trust the American people or you dont.
0.14 Thats why you get Obamacare, and they want to tell us what kind of insurance to buy.
0.19 Thats why you get Common Core.
0.33 They want to take away our gun rights under the Second Amendment.
0.17 They want to take away our religious liberty rights.
0.27 So, yes, there is accountability to the students through choice and competition.
0.38 We dont need the nanny state to protect us from ourselves.
0.22 I was just saying to my colleague, I may be the last person in this audience without an iPhone.
0.42 Im actually one of the last ones, I still have a BlackBerry in my pocket, and I basically use it for scheduling.
0.37 I use it to keep up with my wifes here, my three kids at home.
0.35 The only games on that phone are Brick Layer.
0.21 I use it to keep up with the news on the internet.
0.20 I may be the last American out there without a smartphone.
0.22 My apologies.
0.18 Absolutely.
0.20 When the Saints go back to repeat we were talking about beer sales earlier.
0.12 All those folks who are being hung over in Louisiana from drinking and celebrating Drew Brees winning it, I think it would be a great day to take off.
0.16 No, look.
0.16 On a serious note, I do want to say this about the Super Bowl and our athletes.
0.14 They can be great role models for our children, and Im, obviously, a Saints fan.
0.23 Drew Brees and his wife, great role models, great Christians.
0.20 So, yes, it should be a holiday.
0.25 Our message is to conservatives.
0.22 This is our hour.
0.26 Thanks to the insanity, the incompetence of the Democratic Party, the American people are ready to turn our government over to us.
0.20 Its not enough to elect just any Republican, however.
0.27 The reality is, the idea of America is slipping away.
0.19 As Christians, we believe that the tomb is empty.
0.14 As Americans, we believe that our best days are always ahead of us, and they can be again.
0.15 We must win this election.
0.47 We cannot allow Hillary Clinton to take us down this path towards socialism, further down this path.
0.22 Ive got the courage to apply our conservative principles.
0.30 I cant do it alone.
0.22 With your help, with Gods grace, we can save the idea of America before its too late.
0.14 Yeah, I think its one thing to shrink the size of a state government, but its another thing to actually get something accomplished in Washington.
0.41 Its a much tougher field, and Im the one on this stage, and frankly on both stages, that has actually gone to Washington, said we would shrink government, said we would shake things up, and actually delivered for the conservative cause.
0.53 Everything from welfare reform, which was the largest, most significant accomplishment in the last 25 years for conservatism.
0.41 I authored the bill when I was in the House of Representatives, I managed the bill on the floor of the United States Senate.
0.08 You need a conservative who can deliver, and thats what I bring to the table.
0.23 Well, if you look at my flat tax, it actually takes the best of what Steve Forbes, Art () and many have been advocating a long time, which is a very strong pro tax code.
0.16 Very simple.
0.17 And it adjusts it to make sure that it is not regressive.
0.51 We have a $2,750 per person tax credit.
0.37 Thats $2,750 off the taxes due, not a deduction of credit.
0.30 If you run the numbers, no American who is going to be paying more taxes under our proposal.
0.21 So we have accomplished both.
0.41 We have a system that has a low single rate, but we take care of American families.
0.49 Im talking about $2,750 per person.
0.40 That means a family of four, thats an $11,000 tax credit.
0.18 Thats very, very strong pro-family.
0.37 If you looked at the Wall Street Journal today and so many of the publications that have been out there, theyve talked about how the biggest problem () the middle of this country for workers to be able to rise and actually the breakdown of the American family.
0.37 William Galston, a liberal, said that on the page of the Wall Street Journal today.
0.34 That the key to poverty is families.
0.20 We put forth a pro-growth Steve Forbes plan, combined it with a pro-family plan, and thats why I think its going to work and work effectively.
0.20 Well, we shouldnt be putting tariffs on anything.
0.31 That hurts working men and women in this country.
0.25 What we should be doing is making our manufacturing more competitive.
0.71 One of the reasons I introduced the 20/20 plan, 20 percent flat tax on corporations as well as on individuals, is so we could be competitive, so we can bring those manufacturing jobs back.
0.14 You want to talk about cutting pollution.
0.20 You do a little back of the envelope.
0.37 We produce, per dollar GDP, about one-fifth of the CO2 and other pollutants that China produces.
0.47 So were five times more efficient at producing goods here as far as the environment is concerned.
0.19 Why?
0.22 Because of bad tax policy, bad regulatory policy and, yes, bad trade policy.
0.14 We need to have a President thats going to pledge, as I have.
0.23 Im going to make America the number one manufacturer so working men and women can have good-paying jobs again in America.
0.31 We have an immigration policy that Senator Graham supported that brings in even more low-wage workers into this country.
0.29 He says he wants to solve problems.
0.30 Thats great, but youre not solving problems for American wage earners.
0.34 Youre not solving problems for workers in America, who have seen their wages flatline and have been disaffected enough to leave the workplace.
0.14 We need to get better training, better skills, including vocational education and training in community colleges.
0.23 But the bottom line is, we have to make sure that we are not flooding this country withLet me try to get a word in edgewise.
0.21 A true conservative loves to create a level playing field.
0.16 Thats what government is supposed to do.
0.20 Theyre not supposed to favor one group over another.
0.27 And when it comes to our manufacturers, the level playing field is not in the United States, its international.
0.47 And so the federal government should have laws, tax laws, regulatory laws and, yes, finance laws.
0.45 Theres 60 other ex-im banks all over the world.
0.48 Every major competitor for the United States manufacturing dollar has one of those banks.
0.14 And guess what?
0.40 They use those banks a heck of a lot more than the United States of America does, number one.
0.19 So in order to have a level playing field, which is what conservatives talk about all the time, a level playing field, then we have to have export financing.
0.25 And heres why: Because export financing doesnt help Boeing or GE.
0.24 GE just lost a contract.
0.18 You know what they did?
0.34 They went to France.
0.20 They got the ex-im bank in France to support it.
0.23 And what did they do?
0.40 They moved manufacturing out of South Carolina, out of Texas, moved it to Hungary and to France.
0.36 GE is still making money, GE is still doing well, but American workers are out of jobs.
0.20 Thats why we have to have this level playing field so we can compete with the rest of the world.
0.52 Well, first, since you mentioned Colorado, I just want to thank the people of Colorado, because four years ago you gave me the honor of winning the nomination out here in the state of Colorado and on a night we won three states, and it catapulted us to win 11 states, ultimately.
0.10 And so I just want to thank you very, very much for that support.
0.18 And in response to that, I do drink a lot of Coors beer, so thought I would help.
0.21 The answer is pretty simple.
0.17 The answer is simple.
0.31 There are no shortage of breweries around the United States of America.
0.23 I do as I travel around the country, I do pints and politics, and I go to breweries all over the place.
0.20 And there is almost no town in America that doesnt have a brewery.
0.06 So I dont think we need to worry too much.
0.17 Obviously, if theres some anti-competitive issues, we have agencies to look at that.
0.28 But, no, Im not concerned that Americans are not going to have choices in beer.
0.29 I would just say this, that what youre seeing is in healthcare, youre seeing a lot of consolidation and that consolidation is occurring because of Obamacare.
0.25 You are seeing it particularly in an area that I am concerned about.
0.39 And thats in health insurance.
0.50 Youre seeing the big health insurance companies fold up.
0.37 You have seen Obama try to feed health insurance companies, and they have all failed, I think, except one.
0.19 Why?
0.28 Because we have a system of Obamacare, with minimum loss ratios, that make it virtually impossible for a small insurer to operate effectively.
0.20 And this was the motive behind Obamacare.
0.16 This wasnt incidental.
0.21 This was deliberate to make it so impossible for smaller insurers to survive.
0.24 If they consolidate into a small group, then the left can say, Oh, there is no competition, we need the single payer.
0.25 Thats why we have to reform Obamacare.
0.78 Well, if you look at a plan that I introduced, the 20/20 clear vision for America, we increased growth by 10 percent, 1 percent a year.
0.27 So we go from 2.3 to 3.3.
0.25 In repealing Obamacare, its another .7.
0.45 So youre looking at 4 percent growth, according to the Tax Foundation.
0.55 And unlike Donald Trump and Bobby Jindal, we dont add $10 trillion to the deficit.
0.45 In fact, our plan, while it creates as many jobs as their plan does, and grows the economy as much as theirs does, we are a revenue-neutral plan because I believe that we need to reduce the size of government, yes, but we also need to reduce our deficit, and we need to get our budget balanced so we can start paying down this debt.
0.43 And adding a trillion dollars worth of tax cut and getting no more growth is not the way to do it.
0.45 But thats only half of it.
0.26 The word economy comes from the Greek word oikos, which means family.
0.35 The family is the first economy.
0.16 The one thing that we do not talk about enough is how stable families are vitally important for the middle of America to be prosperous and grow and be safe.
0.23 And I will have policies not just tax policies that will make sure that families are strong again in America.
0.23 MLB, NHL.
0.19 So Im a big sports fan.
0.28 And the Wall Street Journal.
0.43 Those are the three apps I use the most.
0.32 Well, since were usually in the Super Bowl, the Pittsburgh Steelers Steeler Nation, anybody?
0.21 No.
0.36 I was in Kansas City over the weekend to watch the Steeler game, and about a third of the crowd were Steeler fans, so Im usually not alone when I call out Steeler Nation.
0.26 But we are used to being in the Super Bowl, so actually, it is in Pennsylvania already.
0.27 I grew up in a steel town in western Pennsylvania, outside of Pittsburgh, and when I announced for President, I announced from a factory floor.
0.12 When I talk about making America the number one manufacturer again in the world, its not just talk.
0.12 When I talk about having the opportunity for people to rise again, its not just because it polls well.
0.23 I represented the old steel valley of Pittsburgh.
0.64 I represented a 70 percent Democratic district and won with 60 percent of the vote.
0.19 Why?
0.19 Because I aligned myself with working men and women who feel that neither party and certainly not Washington, D.C., cares about them.
0.15 You are like me.
0.18 We will get American workers on the side of the Republican party, and we cannot be stopped if we do.
0.13 We need an outsider to run our party and to win the next election.
0.18 Washington has become a corrupt insider game.
0.12 Everybody talks about how theyre going to change the taxes, grow the economy, nothing seems to change.
0.22 By the way, Bobby, I shrunk the size of New York States government.
0.64 When I left, we had reduced the employment by over 25,000 and cut taxes.
0.13 But I understand to change Washington, you have to understand government as well.
0.15 You cant just be an outsider, you cant just be someone who throws stones at Washington.
0.14 You have to be someone who can actually bring people together across party lines.
0.14 I can do that.
0.15 I will do that if I have the chance to lead this party.
0.24 Becky, can I comment on this question?I have two sons.
0.35 They both served overseas, one in Iraq and one in Afghanistan.
0.26 I understand we have got to do far more to help our military, help our veterans and help protect our security.
0.20 This is a bad deal.
0.28 But to protect our military, I would have signed it.
0.16 Its not going to be the case.
0.33 If I have a chance to lead this country, were going to reduce the deficit, shrink the government, lower the tax burden and govern the private sector because thats how you solve deficits.
0.15 No, I dont think we need a military response, but we need a coordinated response.
0.27 And I have to say that I think that the Obama Administration has been completely lax, to say the least, in dealing with these cyber attacks, not just by governments like North Korea, but by particularly Chinese and other countries.
0.33 And what I would do is put in place a policy where if we know a company, say a Chinese company, is hacking into American companies, stealing trade secrets, as we know they do every day, we will retaliate against that company and say that that company is not going to be allowed to continue to do trade with the United States.
0.49 I would also look at what were doing at the federal level and put in place what Israel has done, a one federal agency dealing with cyber security and charged with working across the aisles to make sure we have the best technology.
0.17 I think they have gone too far.
0.15 I think weve seen Wall Street really blossom and do very well when the rest of the country is struggling.
0.14 And its because we have this corrupt connection between Wall Street and Washington.
0.19 And, John, you were just talking about what loopholes would you get rid of.
0.29 I would get rid of virtually every single one of them.
0.61 They cost American taxpayers $1.4 trillion a year.
0.13 I would throw them all out.
0.46 No, I would keep first, yes, but what I would do, I would lower the tax on manufacturing to the lowest in the developed world, 12 percent.
0.26 We all have plans.
0.27 I have a plan.
0.26 We all have plans.
0.59 My plan, the Tax Foundation said, would create 5 and a half million new jobs over the next decade.
0.23 The difference, though, is I will get my plan enacted.
0.45 Because when I was Governor of New York, I passed sweeping tax code cuts in a democratic state with a democratic legislature.
0.34 Bobby, youre talking about your tax cuts.
0.29 I cut taxes more than everybody on this stage.
0.54 More than everybody on the next stage combined by more than the other 49 states, in New York State.
0.23 I dont just have a plan.
0.30 I will enact tax cuts, get rid of those loopholes, and make the system fairer for all Americans.
0.19 Very simply, you guys talk over each other in Washington all the time.
0.26 Im not used to that.
0.16 We listen when people talk.
0.23 We have a skills gap.
0.27 You mentioned the construction company.
0.41 The construction industry says one of their biggest problems, they cant find the craftsmen to do the work.
0.15 What we have to do in America, is honor blue-collar work again.
0.12 We have to honor the carpenter, the plumber, the electrician who can actually build something.
0.13 And instead of just saying that a college degree delivers prestige, lets celebrate those who do things with their hands and elevate their skills, using training in high school and community collegesso that we can have a better-quality workforceBut let me go back a little bit here.
0.17 We need to grow our economy faster.
0.49 Weve had the worst economic recovery since the Great Depression.
0.17 And its because of policy in Washington and policy at the Fed.
0.09 Let me go back to Washington.
0.49 In 2009John, no question Barack Obama inherited an economic disaster in 2009.
0.22 But what did he do?
0.62 Instead of focusing on pro-growth policies and the economy, he ran through Obamacare, the worst law of my lifetime, that hurt small businesses, hurt companies, raised taxes, and almost completely eliminated one industry because of its taxes.
0.29 The Fed had to act.
0.33 And the Fed did act appropriately in reducing interest rates.
0.39 But theyve reduced them now for seven straight years.
0.45 Thats never happened before.
0.26 Theyve been zero for way too long.
0.26 They should raise the rates.
0.25 The Fed should get out of manipulating the market.
0.29 And the Fed also, by the way, should reduce its balance sheet, 2.7 trillion, let some of those bonds mature and put the money back in the banking system so our economy can grow.
0.17 Yeah, absolutely.
0.31 One of the things that troubles me about the Republican Party is too often we question science that everyone accepts.
0.16 I mean, its ridiculous in the 21st century we are questioning whether or not () things are the appropriate way to go.
0.22 Of course they are.
0.20 And its also not appropriate to think that human activity, putting CO2 into the atmosphere, doesnt make the earth warmer, all things being equal.
0.33 It does.
0.26 Its uncontroverted.
0.11 I think part of the problem is the () way Republicans think about climate change.
0.17 Say, Oh, my God.
0.35 We are going to have higher taxes, more Obama, more big government, the EPA shutting down factories.
0.19 Thats not the solution I see.
0.20 Governments role is to incentivize innovation and the entrepreneurial spirit in America.
0.13 We can have far more clean energy.
0.26 We can have next generation nuclear reactors that have no risk of meltdown.
0.51 We can have solar panels on every home that are four times more efficient than today.
0.23 R&D credits that the private sectors do this, develop this innovation.
0.18 Not only would we solve our problems, we would have clean energy, cheaper energy here.
0.23 We could export those technologies to places like China, like India.
0.29 So we would grow our economy, have a far greater impact globally, have a secured domestic source of energy and cleaner, healthier air.
0.25 Thats the solution.
0.24 Embrace science, embrace innovation and change.
0.29 The one I use the most is Uber.
0.23 You know, I used to get driven.
0.25 When I was governor, I had a driver.
0.16 I dont anymore.
0.16 Its an example of what Millennials are doing to change America for the better.
0.16 And I tweet a lot, too.
0.13 So Uber, Twitter, and then I communicate with my family.
0.16 Im a long-suffering Jets fan, so my answer is no, theres no reason to take off the day after the Super Bowl.
0.12 Let me just add this.
0.12 The Mets are going to win tonight.
0.11 Thank you for the opportunity to be with this great audience tonight.
0.15 Im a limited government conservative.
0.21 And I mean by that that not just when it comes to economic issues, leaving them to the state, but social issues as well.
0.34 And in that I differ from every single other candidate seeking the Republican nomination.
0.24 I take the Tenth Amendment very, very seriously.
0.28 Im a Republican who embraces science and understands we have to work with the next generation of Millennials to have the innovation and technology so that we can grow a 21st century economy.
0.19 And Im a Republican who understands in Washington, when youre a leader, you have to put aside partisan politics to do whats right for the people.
0.23 We are one America.
0.22 We work together across party lines.
0.18 There is no problem we cant solve, and the 21st century will be Americas greatest century.
0.10 Thank you for having me here tonight.
0.10 How about a round of applause for Boulder, Colorado.
0.17 This is a beautiful place.
0.27 Looking at their academic standards, anybody gotten into the university has been invited to this debate tonight.
0.17 Here is my take on things.
0.27 Without national security, there is no economic security.
0.22 Without the sacrifice of the veterans, all of our hopes and dreams are at risk.
0.45 Just a few days ago, Hillary Clinton said that the problems with the DA are being exaggerated by Republicans.
0.28 They are not.
0.24 They are real.
0.10 Let me tell you what is real: The threat to our homeland.
0.32 Ive never seen so many threats to our homeland than I do today.
0.30 Barack Obama is an incompetent commander in chief.
0.48 There are more terrorist organizations with safe havens to attack the American homeland than any time since 9/11.
0.49 We are in the process of reducing our defense spending by half.
0.27 Im looking at this budget with one view in mind.
0.19 Will it restore the ability to defend this nation?
0.48 We are on track to have the smallest Army since 1940.
0.50 The smallest Navy since 1915.
0.45 This budget, if it is paid for, will put $40 billion back in the Defense Department at a time we need it.
0.25 The number one role of the Federal Government is to defend this nation.
0.13 I intend to be a commander in chief that can win a war we cannot afford to lose.
0.23 Heres the problem.
0.36 Were being walked all over because our Commander in Chief is weak in the eyes of our enemies.
0.32 Do you think Putin would be in the Ukraine today if Ronald Reagan were President?Why are the Chinese stealing are our intellectual property, hacking into our system?
0.36 Why are they building islands over resource-rich waters?
0.14 Because they can get away with it.
0.37 At the end of the day, ladies and gentlemen, the foreign policy of Barack Obama needs to be replaced and the last person you want to find to replace his foreign policy is his Secretary of State.
0.11 So, to the Chinese, when it comes to dealing with me, youve got a clenched fist and an open hand.
0.22 You pick.
0.31 The party is over to all the dictators.
0.18 Make me commander in chief and this crap stops.
0.09 No, I think Im trying to solve problems that somebody better solve.
0.15 Now, you dont have to believe that climate change is real.
0.19 I have been to the Antarctic; Ive been to Alaska.
0.20 Im not a scientist, and Ive got the grades to prove it.
0.48 But Ive talked to the climatologists of the world, and 90 percent of them are telling me that greenhouse gas effect is real.
0.32 That were heating up the planet.
0.19 I just want a solution that would be good for the economy that doesnt destroy it.
0.18 I want to fix an immigration system.
0.09 Im not going to tell you if you like your doctor, you can keep them; if you like your healthcare, you can keep it.
0.20 Im tired of telling people things that they want to hear that we know were not going to do.
0.28 Were not going to eliminate the corporate tax, but we can make it lower.
0.26 Were going to fix immigration only if we work together.
0.20 I want to secure the border, because if we dont, were going to get hurt and hit again.
0.19 I want to fix a broken visa system.
0.25 I want to increase legal immigration because were going to have a shortage of workers over time.
0.31 As to the 11 million, I want to talk about fixing the problem.
0.36 Were not going to deport 11 million people and their legal citizen children, but we will deport felons.
0.03 And those who stay will have to learn our language to stay, because I dont speak it well, but look how far how, at the end of the day, folks, I am trying to solve the problem and win an election.
0.26 Im tired of losing.
0.27 Good God, look who were running against.
0.32 The number one candidate on the other side thought she was flat broke after her and her husband were in the White House for eight years.
0.31 The number two guy went to the Soviet Union on his honeymoon, and I dont think he ever came back.
0.42 If we dont beat these peopleThe first thing we have to do is come to grips with the reality that were facing as Americans.
0.48 In 1950, there were 16 workers for every Social Security recipient.
0.44 Today theres three.
0.48 In 20 years, there are two.
0.16 I want to make sure that no American company leaves America because you cant find a worker.
0.13 American workers always get the first preference, but if you cant find an American worker after you advertise at a competitive wage, I dont want you to be at a loss.
0.26 Bring people in based on merit.
0.30 Lets take a broken immigrationand make a merit-based immigration system that will help our economy.
0.15 Were going to need workers in theWe owe to every businessperson and worker in America the best environment in the world to create a job.
0.14 We owe that to American business.
0.72 35 percent corporate tax rate is the second highest in the world.
0.20 We need to lower it so they dont leave.
0.35 The goal is to help the middle class.
0.20 We can talk about corporations all day long, but my goal is to help the middle class, somebody who makes too much to be on government assistance but still lives paycheck to paycheck.
0.14 When the kid gets sick, you dont go on vacation.
0.17 Thats the purpose of my presidency, to grow the economy here.
0.27 And let me tell you, our democratic friends have a list a mile long for more government.
0.17 Thats not going to grow the middle class.
0.28 Thats going to create a burden on your children, which they are already overburdened.
0.12 The best way to grow the middle class is to make it a good place to create a job.
0.28 Do you know why Boeing came to South Carolina when they could have gone anywhere to build the 787?
0.24 Because we wanted them.
0.41 We had a structurea structure that allowed them to build the building even faster than they thought they could build it.
0.26 We welcomed them there.
0.18 Im going to take the South CarolinaI think everybody owes an obligation to the country.
0.65 The ones that Im most worried about are the 1 percent of Americans in uniform who have been fighting this war for 14 years.
0.15 They need a commander in chief who knows what the hell theyre doing.
0.39 My first job as President of the United States is to rebuild the military and use it smartly.
0.26 Admiral Mullen said the debt is a big threat to our national security.
0.24 Hes right.
0.17 But people go where theyre welcome when it comes to job creation.
0.14 If I am President of the United States, you will be welcomed in America.
0.14 This will be the place to come when it comes to a job.
0.12 If I amNow, if youre looking for good beer policy, Im your best bet.
0.29 My dad owned the bar.
0.14 I know beer.
0.32 We grew up, my sister and myself, in the back of that bar, in one room with my mom, my dad and my sister, who is nine years younger.
0.37 When I was 21, my mom was diagnosed with Hodgkins disease.
0.17 Neither parent finished high school.
0.23 She died within a year.
0.42 We were wiped out from the medical bills.
0.21 And if it wasnt for Social Security survivor benefit check coming into my family, we wouldnt have made it.
0.26 Because my dad died 15 months later.
0.21 So ImWait a minute, please.
0.45 Im 22, and were wiped out.
0.27 I am 60.
0.28 Im not married; I have a military retirement.
0.24 Im in good shape.
0.22 I would give up some of my benefits to help those who need it more than I do.
0.14 To young people here, I will ask you to work a little bit longer because we have to.
0.18 The purpose of my presidencyis to save this country.
0.21 And to save Social Security by working across the aisle, just like Ronald Reagan.
0.24 This is the biggest issue facing this nation.
0.24 Well, number one, the only reason I have an iPhone is because I gave my number to Donald Trump.
0.25 Dont do that.
0.40 That was more upgrading technology in my whole staff.
0.22 Number one, FOX News.
0.29 Sorry, CNBC.
0.29 Were in the Republican primary here.
0.18 Well, I think a national holiday would be the day that Commander in Chief Barack Obama doesnt have that job.
0.18 But unlike these other three, I want to win New Hampshire.
0.30 Go Tom Brady, go Patriots.
0.20 Somebody said, or maybe I saw it on the bill of a cap: Lets make America great again.
0.15 America is great!I intend to make America strong again.
0.22 Im going to be the champion of the middle class where I came from.
0.15 If you make me your President, our best days are ahead.
0.18 Im ready to be commander in chief.
0.20 Ladies and gentlemen, on day one, I intend to win a war that we cannot afford to lose.
0.22 I will be a commander in chief worthy of sacrifice of those brave Americans who have been defending our nation.
0.21 They have had our back.
0.18 God knows they have had our back.
0.18 I intend to have their back as commander in chief.
0.18 Make me commander in chief.
0.12 Good question, but I want to tell you, my great concern is that we are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job.
0.31 I've watched to see people say that we should dismantle Medicare and Medicaid and leave the senior citizens out -- out in the -- in the cold.
0.32 I've heard them talk about deporting 10 or 11 -- people here from this country out of this country, splitting families.
0.44 I've heard about tax schemes that don't add up, that put our kids in -- in a deeper hole than they are today.
0.12 We need somebody who can lead.
0.12 We need somebody who can balance budgets, cut taxes... You know, frankly, I did it in Washington, in Ohio, and I will do it again in Washington, if I'm president, to get this country moving again.
0.10 Well I want to comment on this.
0.15 This is the fantasy...
0.22 This is the fantasy that I talked about in the beginning.
0.34 I'm the only person on this stage that actually was involved in the chief architect of balancing the Federal Budget.
0.23 You can't do it with empty promised.
0.22 You know, these plans would put us trillions and trillions of dollars in debt.
0.26 I actually have a plan.
0.36 I'm the only one on this stage that has a plan that would create jobs, cut taxes, balance the budget and can get it done because I'm realistic.
0.12 You just don't make promises like this.
0.27 Why don't we just give a chicken in every pot, while we're, you know, coming up -- coming up with these fantasy tax schemes.
0.23 We'll just clean it up.
0.30 Where are you gonna clean it up?You have to deal with entitlements, you have to be in a position to control discretionary spending.
0.21 You gotta be creative and imaginative.
0.09 Now, let me just be clear, John.
0.69 I went into Ohio where we had an $8 billion hole and now we have a $2 billion surplus.
0.68 We're up 347,000 jobs.
0.35 When I was in Washington, I fought to get the budget balanced.
0.19 I was the architect.
0.46 It was the first time we did it since man walked on the moon.
0.64 We cut taxes and we had a $5 trillion projected surplus when I left.
0.15 That's was hard work.
0.18 Fiscal discipline, know what you're doing.
0.23 Creativity.
0.21 This stuff is fantasy.
0.35 Just like getting rid of Medicare and Medicaid.
0.18 Come on, that's just not -- you scare senior citizens with that.
0.24 It's not responsible.
0.13 Well, I mean right here.
0.26 To talk about we're just gonna have a 10 percent tithe and that's how we're gonna fund the government?
0.20 And we're going to just fix everything with waste, fraud, and abuse?
0.11 Or that we're just going to be great?
0.73 Or we're going to ship 10 million Americans -- or 10 million people out of this country, leaving their children here in this country and dividing families?Folks, we've got to wake up.
0.13 We cannot elect somebody that doesn't know how to do the job.
0.12 You have got to pick somebody who has experience, somebody that has the know-how, the discipline.
0.40 And I spent my entire lifetime balancing federal budgets, growing jobs, the same in Ohio.
0.11 And I will go back to Washington with my plan.
0.29 And I will have done it within 100 days, and it will pass.
0.10 And we will be strong again.
0.14 Thank you.
0.12 Let me just -- let me respond.
0.38 First of all, Ohio does have an energy industry, but we're diversified.
0.44 We're one of the fastest growing states in the country.
0.25 We came back from the dead.
0.13 And you know what?
0.21 It works very, very well.
0.26 And secondly, when you talk about me being on the board of Lehman Brothers, I wasn't on the board of Lehman Brothers.
0.16 I was a banker and I was proud of it.
0.23 And I traveled the country and learned how people made jobs.
0.12 We ought to have politicians who not only have government experience but know how the CEOs and the job creators work.
0.37 My state is doing great across the board.
0.35 And guess what, in 2011, I got a deal... ... an agreement with the... ... that he tried to take credit for four years later.
0.26 It's a joke.
0.19 John Harwood, there's a bigger issue here.
0.28 Well, first of all, when we talk about the Import Export Bank, it's time to clean up corporate welfare.
0.20 If we're gonna reform welfare for poor people, we ought to reform it for rich people, as well.
0.74 Secondly, in our state, we went from a loss of 350,000 jobs to, now, a gain of 347,000 jobs to the positive.
0.78 Our wages are growing faster than the national average, and I've cut taxes more than any sitting governor in this state -- $5 billion, including no taxes on small business and killing the death tax.
0.21 I want to go back to what we were talking about earlier, this budget deal in Washington.
0.28 This is the same old stuff since I left.
0.17 You spend the money today and then you hope you're going to save money tomorrow.
0.34 I don't know if people understand, but I spent a lifetime with my colleagues getting us to a federal balanced budget.
0.30 We actually did it.
0.18 And I have a road map and a plan right now to get us to balance.
0.23 Reforming entitlements, cutting taxes.
0.09 You see, because if you really want to get to a balanced budget, you need to reduce your expenses and you need to grow your economy.
0.18 So what I will tell you about our incentives -- our incentives are tight, and at the end of the day we make sure that we gain more from the creation of jobs than what we lose.
0.13 And you know what?
0.28 Ohio, one of the best growing places in the country -- I not only did it in Washington, I did it in Ohio, and I'll go back to Washington, and there will be no more silly deals... ...
0.22 If I become President because we'll have a Constitutional Amendment to require a federally balanced budget so they will do their job.
0.61 Well, first of all, we're running a $2 billion dollar surplus, we're not having a revenue problem right now.
0.33 And, sending mixed signals to kids about drugs is a disaster.
0.53 Drugs is one of the greatest scourge in this country, and I spent five years of my administration working with my team to do a whole sort of things to try to reign in the problem of overdoses, and it goes on and on.
0.19 We could do a whole show on that.
0.20 I want to go back for a second thought on this issue of income inequality.
0.46 My program would move the 104 programs of the federal Department of Education into four block grants, and send them back to the states because income inequality is driven by a lack of skills when kids don't get what they need to be able to compete and win in this country.
0.30 The fact is, in order to get this economy moving again, I call for freezing regulations for a year except for the problem of public safety.
0.22 I believe that we need to cut these taxes down, we need to be on a roadmap to balancing the budget, and we need to send power, money, and influence, the welfare department, the education department, job training, infrastructure, Medicaid, all of that out of Washington back to the states so we can run these programs from where we live to the top, not a one size fits all mentality that they have in Washington.
0.26 And, that will get to the nub of opportunity for our children, and an ability to see wages rise.
0.58 Again... ...One more time, in Ohio, our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0.44 We've cut taxes, balanced budgets, changed the regulatory environment.
0.21 Folks, you want to ---- fix America, this is the formula.
0.30 It worked for Reagan and it works for our team in Ohio.
0.14 Thank you.
0.74 I wanna tell you, in my state, we took Medicaid, the hardest program to control, and we took it from a 10 percent growth rate to 2.5 percent without taking one person off the rolls or cutting one single benefit.
0.47 And so much of what we did -- to force competition, to use technology, to stand down the special interest groups -- can you imagine taking Medicaid from 10 to 2.5 percent?We can take many of those same procedures, we can apply it to Medicare.
0.19 We can make a stronger program.
0.17 But I agree with Jeb, you can't just do this by growing the economy.
0.08 You can't grow your way out of demographics.
0.08 But we can give people better health care.
0.40 And finally, on health care, why don't we start treating -- keep giving... ...incentives for people to keep people healthy, rather than giving the incentives to treat them when they're sick?I was on morning Joe at a town hall and a young student stood up and said, "Can I still be idealistic?
0.20 "I said, absolutely, you can still change the world.
0.15 And, you know the old inscription, if you save one life, you've changed the world.
0.13 Folks, we have a problem here with the leadership in Washington, but I'll tell you another problem.
0.18 We need to rebuild our families.
0.22 We need to have stronger families.
0.12 We need to know who our neighbors are.
0.18 We need to come together as a country because we have to realize that America is great, not from the top-down.
0.33 Oh yeah, we want to elect a good president, but America is great from the bottom-up, and the bottom-up is us in our families, in our communities, in our neighborhoods.
0.17 We will renew America if we work together, and I am totally confident that we will.
0.20 And God bless America.
0.11 Well, John, I don't really have any weaknesses that I can think of.
0.07 But my wife is down here in the front, and I'm sure, if you'd like to talk to her later, she can give you more than you'll ever be able to take care of.
